"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","One of baby's first and favorite books, and it is washable! I gave 1 less star than perfect because I'd like to see some diversity in the people - not just your typical white family ;)",4,1
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"It has been many years since we needed diaper pins, but I do like to pin my socks together through the wash and have never lost one yet. I was using brass dressmaker pins but they tended to open up during the wash cycle. My wife suggested diaper pins and we tried them. Thery're working perfectly and staying together through the washing. Matter of fact they can get a little tricky to open, but of course that was the idea. Recommended to keep your socks &#34;friended up&#34;.",5,1
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I'm a new mom and I was looking for something to record my baby's daily activities and patterns and it is perfect! It has a lot of space to write down anything extra beyond the diaper changes, feedings and sleeping. I like that it has an area to write down medications. It is a great reminder for dr appointments and to track your baby's patterns. I am extremely happy with this book and will be ordering another one for when I run out of pages in 3 months.",5,1
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,We bought these trucks for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- We love them!  They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower.  Perfect first trucks!  And they aren't too big- a perfect size!,5,1
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"We just bought this for my 9 month old daughter,she loves these cars, loves to turn the wheels and lookat the faces. She especially loves the little green car,it's the perfect size to fit in her tiny hand and it rattles.This toy is a hit! I highly recommend it.",5,1
Earlyears: Earl E. Bird with Teething Rings,"We received an Earl E. Bird as a gift when we had our first baby eleven years ago. Since then, Earl has seen us through teething for three kids, and is still in good condition for our fourth baby!  He's a little faded around the edges, but just as loveable and soft, with difference textures for a chewy, drooly baby to gnaw on.I like that he's fully washable, and a nice quiet toy (at least in ours, the squeaker was very quiet to begin with and has since kind of stopped squeaking--but the squeaker was never the big attraction with Earl).  Perfect for taking on planes, or in church, or in the car. A great baby shower gift, since Earl is perfect for a boy or a girl.",5,1
Pooh Baby's First Tigger,Perfect for young children and overall good quality for the price.,5,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Hands down....get this diaper pail... The only reason I ever even need to empty it is when it cant hold anymore! NEVER smells..ever! I change mine about every 2 weeks, like I said, only because thats when it seems to fill. Dont bother w/ the cheapies, this one is IT! Seriously....trust me! The reason why it never smells is because the diaper goes into like a seperate chamber before it gets to the bag, so the air never transfers.Theres nothing else I can say. This is perfection.",5,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",Yes i have pretty sheets on the crib......but who wants to wash them every time there is a mess.  Well this is the answer!  So much easier (since they snap around the crib slats) to get on and off!  Waterproof!!  What else should i say!  Perfect gift!!!,5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"The Mozart Magic Cube was given to my infant daughter as a Christmas gift--she loves it! Perfect for little hands as they are learning coordination and motor skills.  It is fun to listen to the songs and isolate the different instruments or add them back in, one by one.  The rubber sides are durable, especially if dropped.  Nice, also, to have no sharp edges on it, so it is very safe.  My 11 month old niece was over to play and she discovered the cube and was enchanted by it.  I will be giving her one for her very own for her upcoming birthday!  As for the loudness level, I  don't find it terribly loud; however, I recognize it needs to be at a certain level in order for babies to focus in on it (if it were softer, they might not pay attention to it).",5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,this was just as advertised.  Perfect forlittle fingers.  Quite nice toy withlovely sound quality and bright colorsand flashing lights.,5,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our 8 month old loves to &#34;bang&#34; things so this is perfect. He moves it around, bangs on it and lights it up with music. Great buy!",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I searched and searched for a square playpen from the olden days.  Well this fit that criteria perfectly!  I hated to keep her confined to the new smaller pack-n-plays to play in.  To nap is one thing, but to use as a play yard at home is completely different.  She is currently 6 1/2 months old and will play for about 20-30 minutes on her own before her attention span is gone.  This allows me to prepare dinner, clean up a little, or even just sit on the couch and RELAX.  She may still be young, but she's on the move already.  This keeps her in one place, where I left her.It does slope to the middle, but she doesn't have a problem with that, even if I sit her down around the outside of the mat.  She only plays with the crinkly butterfly and hasn't taken the time to discover the other sides to play with.I would recommend this to anyone with a baby girl or boy!!!I (a woman) opened this up and set it up on my own the very first time within a few minutes. We have not taken it down or moved it since I set it up in the living room.  I specifically bought it as a playpen and not a travel pen.Overall, I am VERY pleased with this purchase and have bragged to other friends, that have babies similar age, that I have an Old School Style BIG playpen.",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",This was the frst time our son had been in a playpen. With in minutes he was playing with the ""attached"" toys. In short he loves it. It's perfect to keep him entertained while cooking dinner or taking a shower. It assembles quickly and stores neatly and easily in the included storage bag. We are considering buying another to keep at his grandparents. We would highly recommend the Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play.,5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","the pen is perfect and bigger than the pack n plays with the bassinets.  i wanted something to keep my baby safe in while i was busy cooking or doing dishes.  he can safely play in this and the toys stitched onto the side mesh keep him occupied even if his toys dont.  the only downside is its hard to find playsheets locally.  you have to source them on amazon.  other than that, its a great playpen!",5,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I am very thankful I chose this particular pack-n-play. I've seen the ones my friends have for their babies and I definitely got the best one!!! It also folds up easily and stores nicely. It is a little heavy, but they all are to me. It is sturdy and I think it will last. Sheets that fit this particular model are pricey, though, as it's not the average rectangular shape. Other than that, it is perfect! My daughter loves it and so do I!",5,1
Portable Crib Mattress,"This portable mattress fits perfectly in my Eddie Bauer Manchester Print travel yard(dimensions are 24x38 on both) and is slightly thicker(1/2 inch more) than the other portable crib mattresses that I've seen.Also, this one is waterproof and lightweight. It can be used in both the bassinet and crib portion of the aforementioned travel yard.MUCH better than using just the hard pad that comes with the travel yard.I should add that this also fits graco's pack and play portable crib sheets... which are the sheets I use in my Eddie Bauer travel yard.Seems to be fairly hardy in construction. Should last at least a year or two of regular use. If not.. well, buy another one. They're only $20.00! Regular moms(don't know about day cares) wouldn't need this any longer than that year or so anyway.",5,1
Cosco Portable Crib - White,"We loved the size, look and sturdiness of this portable crib.  Our 4 month old is quickly getting too large for her bassinet and this seemed like the perfect step up.Even with a portable bumper pad, my baby keeps kicking her leg through the rail while laying down.  I have to keep a sharp eye on her as I'm afraid that she will break her leg.  I first noticed this problem a few days ago as she was crying and when I turned around, her leg was sticking out.I pretty much only put her in it when she's super drousy but I'm going to take it back and get a play yard as I don't want to take any chances.  I already have a play yard at her daycare center and didn't want to get another one, but it will be so worth the peace of mind.This crib would be great for babies that don't like to kick as mine does.  She's a little wiggle worm!",4,1
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"This is the best mattress pad I've seen yet!  It is thick, soft, washes beautifully but best of all it fits the crib mattress perfectly without having to pull and tug on it trying to get it to fit only to have one of the corners pop off anyway.  I highly recommend this. I wish I'd had this from the start.",5,1
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I purchased this pad with the BRU Sealy UltraSoft Mattress ($59.99 avail. online)and I couldn't be happier.  I was nervous about the whole crib and bedding purchase b/c of so many different reviews, but I have to say I'm happy I got it right the first time.  The softness of the pad evens out the firmness of the mattress and it's a comfortable bed that I would love to sleep on.  The mattress fits perfectly without the pad and even better with the pad (for overprotective moms who want no finger room between the crib and mattress).  The sheets for her room theme also fit like a glove.  My 9 month old daughter is transitioning out of her bassinet and I have to sneak her in the crib b/c she's not yet used to the extra space, but the first time she slept until 8am and her normal arise time is 6:30-7am.  I am a happier mom with this purchase.",5,1
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"This lullaby player is wonderful. Our baby is 4 1/2 months, and we've had to go into her room several times/night to replace her pacifier for 4 months(didn't have the heart to let her cry it out). The lullaby player has helped us in teaching her to go to sleep on her own. She no longer has a pacifier in her crib. I wanted to use the rainfall or ocean sounds for white noise, but it turned out our baby liked the lullaby setting better.The voice activiation is why I bought it and why it works so well. We rarely go into her room at night now, because as soon as she cries, the player turns on.The only bad thing is a really bad thing. It just inhales the batteries. I assume it uses them so quick because it has to be on all night so the voice activation can be ready. But, we have to replace batteries AT LEAST one a week. This product would be perfect if it could be plugged in.",4,1
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"This is an excellent booster seat!  My cousin bought one for her daughter, so I decided to try it for mine.  Nice and comfy foam material that wipes clean very easily and is lightweight to travel with.  My 2 year old loves sitting at the table like a big girl now.  It brings her to a perfect level to eat at the table.  I have fabric padded kitchen chairs, so I keep a towel under the booster to keep food from ruining the chair fabric.  Highly recommended!!!",5,1
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,"We have a 20 month old boy who was getting too big for his infant seat but too small for a chair.  When I saw this booster online I thought it would be perfect, and it is.  It portable enough to take anywhere and he just loves it.",4,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I saw some other reviews saying that they had issues with some other slow closing seats.  Our son hasn't used this yet, but I wanted to say that this fits our toilet seat PERFECTLY - it's VERY stable!!!  Our seat and toilet have an elongated shape - not round.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We're struggling with potty training our 3yo boy and these potty seats have been great! They are all one piece so there aren't any cracks and crevices that you have to clean, and they are contoured perfect for his little bottom.  There is a handle on the back so it's very easy for adults and kids to lift it off of the toilet, and then you just drop it back into place when your little one needs to go potty.  My sister recommended them to me (she's already trained two kiddos) and we've been truly impressed - as impressed as one can be with a potty trainint seat that is! (wink)",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Love this seat.  With the cheaper seats w/ Disney designs, etc, the pee was always getting everywhere but the potty.  This is perfect for my son.  The bump between the thighs keeps his legs apart so pee gets IN the potty instead of on it and it is deep enough so that even if the pee does not go straight down and still gets in the potty and does not leak under the seat.  Fits well on our toilet seat.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,Early on this is probably the harder way to train (compared to a separate potty) and when little boys pee sitting down you do get a little ring of pee on the toilet seat.  However now that we are potty trained (at 2 years and 3 months) it is perfect. We don't have to teach about going on a different seat or anything. And it stays on the seat easily with little adjustment and pull right off without any trouble if someone else needs to use the potty. I will be using this for my second child as well.,4,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Perfect fit, easy to use, my 3 yr old can place the seat on the toilet himself and can sit on it with the help of a small step stool.  We rinse it off and hang it on the back of his bathroom doorknob.  The seat doesn't wiggle at all, which I could see being a huge issue with some of the other over the toilet seats.  Worth the extra money.",5,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"The Baby Bjorn potty seat is super easy to use - just stick it right on the seat and turn the dial to tighten or loosen.  It works perfectly with our elongated toilet.  Our 2-year old son uses it with ease and is perfectly content to sit there for a long time - sometimes longer than I want him to - he's happy just hanging out on there reading his books.  That said, I do notice that his bum is red when he gets off, which makes me wish the seat were cushy.  However, he does not seem uncomfortable sitting on the seat at all and will sit there for 20 minutes sometimes.  So, I guess he is comfortable and whatever is causing the redness doesn't bother him.",4,1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Perfect, easy to use. I like the tightening turn under so it fits any potty in the house. I've tried other seats. This one is the best for us.",5,1
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"I started potty training my daughter on this potty at about 6 months.  She really took to by 9 months -- able to crawl to it on her own -- and mastered it by 19 months.  I even used it at her bedside to night-potty-train her -- just picked her up, put her on the potty, and put her back to bed.  Easy Breezy.She's is 3 1/2 years old now and we still keep this potty in our car for road trips, in case of emergencies, or when there's not potty available at the local playground.This potty is so small, it fit perfectly under our stroller and in a little bag so we didn't need to rush around looking for a toilet when on walks -- we'd just pulled out her potty so she could go.I love it.  No nooks or crannies to clean. No need to pack and unpack it. No need for diapers to line it (but you can do that if you want to as well.)TIP - Keep a spray-bottle of vinegar handy to disinfect it on the spot. :)",5,1
Double Headrest for Newborns &amp; Infants,"This headrest is perfect.  Since day one my daughter has been comfy using this.  When she was teeny tiny the insert kept her head from flopping forward.  Now that she is bigger we use it without the insert and she's still happy.  At 4 months she has wonderful head control, but I wouldn't put her in her carseat without this.  I tried the head rest that came with her Graco car seat and it was terrible.  It sort of lets her head roll all over when we carry her from the house to the car.  For a small baby I wouldn't even think about using the flimsy headrest they give you with the seat.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We had to buy 3 potties before going for this one. We tried: Graco with soft seat, but its splashguard comed right off; the 1st years 3-in-1 potty had a hole that was located too close to the back thus making it very uncomfortable for a boy, because everything got mashed; and a musical potty by safety 1st, which leaked. This potty finally works! But I am so surprised to find that there is no perfect potty on the market! Looks like consumer reports haven't done much job; one way or the other, big brands have left out our little kid's bottoms with POOR CHOICES, of which the best(truly) here to present - baby bjorn potty chair...hope kids of my kids will do better.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I've been deciding betwieen this one and the smaller version, and I'm so happy I went with the one that has taller back support. I started using it with my 5.5 month doughter and she loves it, she seems very comfortable on it. We've been using it every day, for over a month now. She goes between 5 to 11 times a day. I still get to change 2-3 wet diapers a day, but for the past 16 days she went #2 only in her potty and not even once in the diaper.It's very easy to clean. Perfect size. Love it.",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Very good material, nice and sturdy.  Smooth and rounded at all edges.  The design is simple enough to clean all the nooks and crannies and yet perfect for use.  Definitely deserves an award for design!  This potty is higher than a lot of the competitor's brands but it works for us because it's exactly what we needed for our daughter!",5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,Our little grandson uses this and it's the perfect size.  Love how it's designed so no potty gets on the floor.,5,1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Don't think or look any more, just buy this one.  So easy to use, my son took to it right way.  That's after he had a not so pleasant experience with 2 others we tried first. This potty is lightweight my son can carry it from one room to another; super easy to clean no crevices to trap urine; and nicely designed.  No need for all the bells and whistles, they were distracting to my son too. He's been using it for about 6 months, now I just have to figure out how to transition him to the big potty.  BABYBjorn also makes a potty for that, which I will be buying too. Perfect!",5,1
Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet Tea,"I couldn't fathom why the pack'n'play layette bed needed a sheet. The spittle and drool just wipes off, right? Not as easily as you might hope, and these sheets are just the thing to make it easier. They fit perfectly, match fine, and keep muck off the mat. Way to go, Graco - you've done it again!",4,1
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"This tub is great. It fits nicely in our standard tub. We had another brand tub and it was too snug, but this one fits perfect. My son refuses to take a bath unless he's in this tub.",5,1
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 20-Count",These are perfect for keeping in the diaper bag and putting on tables when you go out to eat.,5,1
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"I am exclusively breastfeeding my baby and am pumping extra so her dad can give her a bottle a day.  The bottle size is perfect for newborns and infants under 1 year who are eating primarily at the breast and are just being given a few ounces of supplement size breastmilk or formula.  My daughter prefers the breast, but she latched onto the Medela nipples without a problem, and did not experience any nipple confusion when going for her next feeding at the breast.  The Medela nipples are very closely shaped like the real thing.  Also, I love how the caps can be used for cup feedings, too.If you have a Pump In Style regular or advanced pump, you'll really like how you can pump directly into these bottles.  Plus, it's good to have a few extra bottles that come with this kit, so you don't have to constantly wash the few that came with the pump and always have clean ones on hand.",5,1
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,The bottles are the perfect size for one feeding. My newborn loves the nipples on those bottles and he cries when I tried to give him a different bottle. Works great with the medela pumps and is perfect for storage. It is one of the few bottles out there that is BPA free.,5,1
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I read all the bad reviews and bought it anyway. Why? I was looking for a nice compact wedge to put on my lap when I read heavy or oversized books in bed. This is perfect! Just the right size and slant, and just what I wanted! For those not happy with it for its intended purpose, there still is good use for it if you like to read in bed.",5,1
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"A decent pillow, wife is expecting and is in her 6th month, and this was perfect gift to her for a good night sleep.",4,1
Evenflo Position and Lock Tall Wood Mount Gate,"I had a difficult time finding a gate that would be tall enough, wide enough and affordable for my home. I found this one a a local BabiesRUs and decided to give it a shot. When I got home, I took it out of the box and put it right up. Perfect! I am going back to buy 2 more.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,this is just the perfect product i was looking for and works perfect on protecting the wood on the crib rail....,5,1
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,"I purchased this for an exposed power strip in my husbands office. Our daughter always heads straight under his desk to all the cords and outlet. This cover does the job perfectly! It is large enough to fit the bigger plugs including cellphone chargers under the lid. It is not extremely difficult to open to an older child may be able to figure it out, but it is perfect for us at the moment.",5,1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"We have a dishwasher and had a full term very healthy child, and still used this product. Lids and nipples tend to turn up in the dishwasher and retain water, and sediment..so what is point if I have to just rewash them?This sterilizer holds 6 bottles, nipples, tops, and pacifiers all at the same time. You can put breast pump parts in it, and anything else that you need to sterilize. I washed everything, filled this with the items and water, and popped it in at 6 minutes in our microwave to have perfectly clean and sterilized bottles, pacifiers, or breast pump parts. I used this everyday until my son was 6 months old, when we stopped sterilizing bottles. Its easy, safe, convenient, and fast.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"This is a great item. Was perfect for storing diapers, wipes, brushes, balm, etc. right on the side of either a bassinet or pack-n-play. Keeps everything organized. Glad I found this!",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Our 6 month old twin boys LOVE this tub!! Finally a bath tub that fits all size babies &amp; can grow with them (unlike other brands). This is a smart design. This tub is dynamic with it's soft contoured mold design that fits perfectly under babies arms &amp; legs. It supports baby in all the right places. It's easy to fill, we simply set it on our kitchen counter and extend the sprayer hose from the faucet to fill it up. There is plenty of room for babies toys and lots of room to splash..... which for the twins creates alot of smiles &amp; squeals of delight. In fact our babies splash so much that we have to put full size bath towels on the floor just to absorb the water!!!! I've read that other parent think this is too big...we also did at first until we used  &amp; realized that it really isn't all that bad &amp; it is definitely worth it.....STILL UNDECIDED?? Here's a helpful hint ....  The tub stores PERFECTLY on the bottom shelf of the changing table. Voila Storage problem solved:)",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is an excellent tub for new parents. It can be used for infants and does not need to be discarded after a few months since it can hold children up to 24 months. Although it seemed large when it came in the box, it is perfect even for use in a small apartment - it is sturdy andcan be put on a counter as needed then hung on a door or in a closet forstorage.",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","As the previous review stated, this is the perfect tub for a tall baby. Our 24 in tall 2 month old outgrew her 4Moms CleanWater tub and we wanted to find a tub she can continue to use as she grows. She loves this tub as she can kick her feet around with plenty of room. It seems to be made well and is super sturdy, we have been using it for a month and I can see using it until she grows out of it. Yes, it is big but we keep it in the bathtub of our spare bathroom all the time so it is not an issue. If you only have one bathroom and are low on storage space, you would probably want to look elsewhere but if you have the space, this is a must!",5,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This bathtub was recommended by one of my best friends, a supermom, and I am so glad I bought this on her advice!We've been using this tub since the little girl was a little under a month, and at first I needed to be more supportive of her as she'd squirm and start to slip one way or another.  But already at just 3 months she lays and splashes and plays in the little molding and we can float a duck around at her and clean her so easily as it supports her.  I love that we'll be able to keep using this bath as she grows into this little baby spa.The material is durable, the molding perfect for a little baby and the features are practical.  There is a max fill line and a little drain, though I really just flip it over after we bath her in our tub.  The biggest issue is storage - it would never have fit in our old apartment.  We leave it in the tub, flipped up to dry.",4,1
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,"I just finished washing two of these covers for the first time, and put one on my changing pad. I was happy to discover that despite the negative reviews I read it fits perfectly. Due to the odd shape of the contoured pad, it did take a few moments to get into the right place.As for the softness, it feels like terry cloth and seems perfectly soft enough. And despite other reviews, it is rather thick...I wouldn't have minded if it was a bit thinner actually.I also haven't had any issue with the straps and the lack of holes, since they are attached at the bottom of the pad and fit over the cover.",5,1
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"After my 4-and-a-half year old, used every day, Fisher Price monitor started only transmitting static, no nursery sounds, I replaced it with a F.P. Sound and Lights monitor. While I could actually hear my baby, I had a lot of static, too.  I was beginning to think something was wrong in my house to cause the static. I returned the F.P. and purchased the First Years Crisp and Clear monitor! Wow!  I get perfect reception all the time and it's so sensitive I can even hear my baby breathing.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I don't use it for baby's, but it keeps my dog in my office perfectly.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"With two rambunctious dogs and a baby on the way I wanted a gate I could have my hands full and still open. This is perfect. My husband was skeptical about the foot pedal opening at first. But my 3 yr old niece came over, tried to get in the nursery and it wouldn't budge!! Love it!",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Perfect for the where we needed it. As a high traffic area for carrying our son, we wanted something with a hands-free opening mechanism and the foot pedal/knee knock works great. It is also extendable but you need to buy the extension separately. More expensive than most pressure mounted gates but I guess that is for the hands-free operation.",5,1
Gerber Knit Crib Sheet ~ Snug Fitting Soft Jersey Knit,"I have two of these crib sheets, in addition to a more decorative sheet that came with my crib bedding set.  These sheets fit my mattress perfectly and are ultra-soft...perfect for baby's bare skin.  To describe them better, imagine what your old, favorite t-shirt feels like...  Also, they're easy to clean.  If the sheets get stained (and they inevitably do), I just spray them with some Oxy Baby Stain Remover and throw them in the wash...and they're perfect all over again.I highly recommend these sheets for anyone who needs a couple to spare.  Besides, you can't really beat the price either!",5,1
Bugs On Board,"When I bought these bugs for my 2 months old boy I anticipated him to get attracted; but his reaction exceeded all my expectations. When he saw these toys hanging on his bouncer he said his first ""Wow!"" :-) Or, whatever he said, definitely meant a big Wow. I had never seen him that excited before. My little man was even more attracted when he discovered that the bugs have crunchy wings, they rattle and the dragonfly buzzes. Toys came in different colors then shown on the picture; but they look even nicer.  The size is perfect also: enough to attract an infant's attention, but not too big so he can hold them easily. He can spend 30 minutes or even more kicking these toys, touching wings and even talking to them! The bugs became his best friends - and mine too because, while he is busy with them in his bouncer or crib, I can spare time for some homework.",5,1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,I bought this for my 3 year old to use in front of our elongated toilet.  It gets her to the perfect height and is very sturdy.  I am using it on a tile floor with large tiles (12x12) and haven't had any issues with it moving around.,5,1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,"Can't do a thorough comparison to other stools, but glad I got this one!Pros:Right height for my daughter to get up to the toilet and sink.Good non-slip footing on top and bottom.Arch is perfect for an adult foot to slide it in and out of place.Cons:A bit pricey for what it is.",4,1
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I have in my cupboard: Tommee Tippee, Playtex Ventaire, Phillips Avent, and the new Similac brand bottles. I also tried Dr. Browns with my firstborn, but Hated them.  I will preface that my babies were exclusively bottle fed, so there is no breast to bottle compatibility issues here.  Also, none of the bottles had leaking issues- the following comparisons are on a 'all else being equal' basis.Tommee Tippee:  Only 3 pieces.  The thing I didn't like, is they are short and squat shaped, so I can't balance the bottle with my chin during a feeding if I need to free up a hand briefly.Playtex Ventaire:  5 pieces.  My only complaint is that the neck is very narrow, so every time I make a bottle, I spill powered formula all over the counter.  I believe they make a wide mouth version though.Phillips Avent:  4 pieces.  There are so many measurement ticks, that it is too hard to read.  There are tick marks for mL, UK oz, and US oz.  And between each whole ounce mark is a sideways teardrop shape marking, but the rounded fat side of this is about 3 millimeters in size, so where the heck am I supposed to fill to- the top or bottom of this round shape?Dr. Browns: 7 pieces.  Two of these pieces need to be cleaned with a pipe cleaner so they are absolutely not dishwasher friendly.  Biggest complaint- the measurements are not in marked in paint, they are clear raised up bumps.  Imagine stumbling to the kitchen at 3am with your eyes half shut and trying to measure a bottle by tiny texture bumps only!Similac:  3-4 pieces.  The stir stick part is optional.  In my opinion, the perfect bottle.  Ergonomic shape, clearly labeled measurement ticks, wide neck... works perfect for me.As I mentioned, I did not have any trouble with leaking.  I also didn't have trouble with my baby not latching properly or not liking any of these.  This review is pretty much strictly from a comparison of the design standpoint.",4,1
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I sarted using these bottles when my daughter was 6 wks. old. I tried other bottles, mostly cheaper ones, and my daughter would be so fussy after eating, have formula all over her, and spit up everything shortly afterwards. I switched to these bottles when I found out my daughter had acid reflux. I had to add cereal to her formula so the Stage 2 nipples worked perfectly for the situation. She is now 12 months and I still use these bottles. I have switched the nipples, yet again, to the Wal-Mart brand and they still work, no collapsing or leaking. These really are great bottles and will definately use these for my second child.",5,1
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I tried these bottles hoping my baby would like them but unfortunately, she still refused to accept them over the breast. She did use them a few times though and didn't have a problem with excess gas or anything.I think the nipples were a little hard but most silicone ones are. We traded to some Playtex latex nipples, which fit perfectly and were softer, more like the breast. She actually drank 4 oz out of it with that nipple.I like that they were different colors and easy to clean because the bottoms come off. I would recommend these to others.",4,1
Night &amp; Day Bottle Warmer,"I LOVE this bottle warmer.  I can do everything right at my bedside, so I don't have to run up and down the stairs.  It holds two bottles and keeps them cold throughout the night, and I keep a bottle of water beside it to fill the little water vials.  You put the water in these pre-measured vials, and when it's time for your little one to eat, you pour a vial into the warmer, drop the bottle in and turn it on.  In about a minute, you have a toasty bottle for baby!  I used Gerber, Avent and Medela bottles, and all worked perfectly.  I recommended it to my two sisters-in-law, and they loved it for bottles and baby food jars, too!",5,1
Night &amp; Day Bottle Warmer,"I have owned this bottle and have used it for my daughter for the past 6 months without a single problem. I have researched every single bottle warmer out there and I can tell you, with confidence, that this is the best you will find. The removable cooler is very convenient with the fact that you do not have to go rooting around your fridge in the middle of the night looking for the bottle, plus it holds two bottles. I use Avent and it works perfectly. It also makes it very convenient to place right in your baby's room! My sole complaint is that the nightlight is not bright enough alone. But the steps to use this are quite simple. First, fill the resevoir with the premeasured water amount, then add the bottle and just press the button to start the warming process! It's just that easy! I have left this device with my family and they have mastered this product within a few uses!I hae noticed many gripes about this product and my response is, READ THE MANUAL!!! As long as you read and follow the instructions in the booklet, you will perfectly okay! The steps are not tricky at all, but there are a few little tips that they give you in order to keep your unit running properly.",5,1
"Baby Buddy Size-It Closet Organizers, Blue, 5 Pack",Just bought this the other day and got them in and already have them hung in my little girls closet! I am a organizer and these are perfect for organizing your childs closet!,5,1
The First Years 16 Piece Take &amp; Toss Infant Spoons,"I bought these spoons for our first family vacation with a 9 month old. We were gone 5 days which included a 12 hour drive there and back. These spoons were great!! The size was perfect, they were sturdy and not flimsy or cheap like an adult disposable spoon. And the price was great to be able to feed him either in the car or at a restaurant and just throw away the spoon and not worry about washing/rinsing them and re-packing them. I will definitely purchase these for any future vacations and will even keep spares in my diaper bag in case I forget to pack his normal spoons.",5,1
The First Years 16 Piece Take &amp; Toss Infant Spoons,"You can't beat the price.  I purchased these to take with me on day/ weekend trips.  They were cheap enough so that I wouldn't be upset if I ever lost one.They are much sturdier than I expected for something considered &#34;toss-able.&#34;  I have washed these in my dishwasher twice already and they are holding up great.  There are no unsightly scratches or discoloring.My pack arrived with blue, green, purple, yellow, orange and PINK spoons.  I have a daughter, so, it was a pleasant surprise.The size is perfect for my 9 month old daughter's little mouth.  I have a 3 year old and although it is on the small size for him, it is still large enough for him to get enough food on the spoon and into his mouth.  I would not recommend these spoons for children over the age of 2.The product arrived at my door in 5 days.",5,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","After reading everyone else's reviews, I was nervous to try this product.  Once I received it (I got 2, one for upstairs and one for downstairs), I read the very short and easy directions, and voila!  Perfect warmth on first use.  Whoever who states its too hot or too cold and complains about it clearly has not read the directions and did not try again because it tells you what to do if its not the temp you want.  To use this simple tool, you need to know if you have an old school bottle or the newer wide mouth bottle and how many ounces your bottle can hold (not how many ounces you're using) and whether you're starting from refrigerated or room temp.  These factors will tell you how much water to pour in the heater using a measuring vial that it comes with.  Press the button down (not in, I thought my warmers were broken) and you'll hear a click or see the light go off when it's done (in about a minute or so...amount of time for a diaper change).  If you leave it in there after its done it will keep heating and get too hot, just like when you're cooking on the stove and turn off the burner and your food keeps cooking.  Keep a rag/towel handy to wipe off the moisture around the bottle when its done.The reason why I give it only 4 stars is because the measuring vial is a pain in the a$$ to fill each time and you have to be exact with the amount of filling water to make your bottle the right temp, but the filling lines are so close together.  I'm planning on using a syringe so that I can have a fail safe, thoughtless, easy way to get the right amount of water in the heater.  Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.",4,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","I read the reviews on this product and several others.  I decided to buy this one and I am glad I did.  During the day I don't need it because I make the formula on demand.  Before we go to bed I make 2 bottles of formula and refrigerate it.  When our baby wakes for those 1 AM and 6 AM feedings, I grab a bottle out of the fridge, throw it in the warmer, grab the baby, change her, and when we are ready for that bottle, it is perfect!  Just the right temperature.  I use the Evenflo bottles with mine, which work great.  I, like the other buyers, have had to learn just how much water to add, but when you get it down pat, it works like a charm.  I highly recommend this unit.  It has simplified our lives and made those early feedings so much more pleasant.  Love this item.  It was well worth the purchase price and the convenience is worth that and more.",5,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","Quick and easy to use, you just have to be careful not to burn yourself with the steam. Other than that it's perfect, my wife loves it.",4,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary",I have the From Dusk To Dawn warmer which is wonderful but is to big to carry the whole thing back and forth from the kitchen to the bedroom at night and vice versa. That's why I bought this one to keep on the kitchen counter for daytime feedings.  I am so glad I did.  This is a great warmer!  Its terrific design holds ANY kind of bottle PLUS includes a special basket to heat baby food jars.  The water vile is transparent and has lines so you can customize and remember the perfect water level for the amount of formula your heating.  The &quot;on&quot; button lights up when it is running and shuts off automatically when it is fully heated. (My 4 yr old son even tells me when the bottle is ready)  Its also nice and small so it doesnt take up much room on your counter.  I'm very glad I purchased this product.,5,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Standard Breast Pump Conversion Kit,"I purchased this kit in order to use my AVENT natural bottles with my Medela POS (insurance provided). They fit perfectly and I have not experienced any leaking. Now I no longer have to transfer pumped milk and lose drops of my &#34;liquid gold&#34;...I just pump straight into the bottle, seal it with ring and sealing disc, and put it in the fridge. No extra bottles to wash!",5,1
"Evenflo 4 Pack Classic Silicone Nipple, Slow Flow",These nipples worked perfectly and wore well.  Easy to use and easy to clean.  Never developed any stains either.  It helped that they came in different sizes for varied flow.,5,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Dome Caps,Perfect replacement for the lids we lost! Exactly like the ones that come with the bottles which we managed to misplace. These lids are awesome because they actually seal off the tip of the nipple to help prevent spills. Our Dr browns bottles had lids that didn't keep the milk from leaking out.,5,1
"Gerber First Essential 6 Pack Silicone Nipples, Fast Flow",I have cats.. and they like to get a hold of the nipples when I leave a bottle out so I need to keep buying these. They work perfect for a few different bottles I use & are in expensive!,5,1
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,Our 9 month old goes for these simple stacking cups out of all toys nearly every time.  Perfect for the price!,5,1
Safety 1st Finger Pinch Guard,"This product was perfect. It did exactly what I needed it to. I purchased it because my toddler is very into slamming doors shut. Not only was I terrified about her pinching her toes, fingers, limbs, etc, the noise was startling and extremely loud. It helps me keep her safe and keep her from potentially locking herself in her room. The foam has withstood a great amount of squishing and slamming and has no marks, dents, or missing pieces. They have held their shape. I also like that I can put these on any point of the door. We put them on the top closest to the hinges most of the time and it keeps her door propped open in  a way. We will be purchasing these again for other doors in the house,",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","We bought two different baby baths before trying this product, and I wish we had just skipped to this. You don't have to worry about the baby sliding, or fitting into the right spot, plus other baby baths keep them up out of the water. With this product, you have complete control over how submerged your child is. My son is 4.5 months old, and we've been using this for about 2.5 months. He is much more comfortable and relaxed on this pillow than he ever was in a baby bath or the sink. It's perfect for us because we have a small house and small bathroom, and it doesn't take up much room. If you don't squeeze as much water out as you can before you hang it to dry, yes it gets a little mildew-smelling but no big deal. After using daily for a few months, the fabric that holds the plastic hangar is starting to unravel but I would guess we'll be able to use it for a year or so before we need to try to repair or replace. It was a great deal.",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","Our son LOVES taking a bath and it's worry-free for us, thanks to the Safer Bather.  This leight-weight bath pillow is perfect for baths in the kitchen sink or inside another tub.  Although our son still fits in the kitchen sink with it, we bought it along with the Primo baby tub and it's an ideal match together.The soft pillow protects our son's head and little body from the sink/tub.  There is a little sunken-in area for his little bottom and he LOVES to sit in it and splash around while we bathe him.  After the bath, we simply give it a squeeze and hang it in the shower to drip-dry overnight.  It can be machine washed but will pill-up if it goes through the dryer.  (still works beautifully, though.)This is a FANTASTIC product to bring while traveling - it's allowed us to give him his bath while on vacation or at grandma's house.I HIGHLY recommend this product!",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","Why put your newborn in a hard plastic seat, when you can have him/her lie on a virtual pillow? My kitchen sink is one of those not evenly split; it has a tiny section on one side and extra wide on the other and this bather fits perfectly into it. My baby has never cried (not even the first time)in this. Why should he? He's covered in warm water, has his head propped up just right, and is on a soft pillow. The really great thing about this bather is that it becomes heavy when wet, so it won't slide around. But when you squeeze some of the water out, it instantly becomes light again.  Simply brilliant! Don't even consider any of the others - this one is perfect!!!",5,1
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","I am in love with this pillow!  With my third baby I was looking for a better solution to the bath time situation.  In the past I used one of those hard plastic tubs, but was tired of storing it in our tiny bathroom.  A friend suggested this and it is perfect for us.I saw some other reviews said it floats on the water - that is not how this works. It is essentially a pillow - filled with stuffing.  You just put it in the tub and then fill with as much water as you wish.  It is a little puffier in the back to keep the babies head out of the water.  I personally like to put a lot of water in the tub, so I just folded up a little hand towel and shoved it under the head to give her a little more of an angle.  We hang it to dry over the tub and have never had a problem with mildew.  I have thrown it into the washer a few times just to be on the safe side.It worked beautifully with an infant laying down AND for an older baby once they start sitting up but aren't balancing well.  We've used it for a year now and I have no complaints!",5,1
BABYBJORN Plate and Spoon - Blue,"I was looking around for the best feeding dish when this bowl/spoon caught my eye.  I read the reviews and purchased it.  It was the best bowl/spoon I have ever sat in front of a kiddo!  Too bad I didn't discover it until my fourth child!  Like other good reviews, the shape is excellent for cornering food, the sides are not too high to be a challenge getting the food up and out of the bowl.  The chunky spoon is perfect and the rubber rim is perfect at giving the grip needed to offset the pressure the scooping of food makes to the edge of the bowl.  My little guy was an independent eater at 1 1/2 half, I should add the he has Down Syndrome and found eating with this bowl a breeze!  I would suggest that the first time you give it to your child you stand behind the highchair and guide the childs hand to the bowl, scoop and bring to his mouth.  I did this demonstration twice and he took right off!!  He does throw the bowl when the food is gone, and it has never broken in almost a year of use.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate Extension,"This fit perfectly and did exactly what it was supposed to do. I am very happy with this purchase, thanks.",5,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate Extension,I have the older style hands free First Years gate and was a little concerned if this would fit but it fits perfectly and my gosh it really makes a difference. The gate fit our hallway before the extension but the supports were almost all the way extended so when we saw that the extension was only 15.00 we decided to give it a go.I do not know how we lived without it. It used to be kinda wobbly and I found myself tightening it every few days. I have not had to tighten it since we bought this extension. I is sooooooooooooooooo much sturdier.,5,1
"The First Years On-The-Go Booster Seat, Safari","After living in SE Asia for the last 7 months, I noticed that the restaurants are not toddler/child friendly. When my husband and I go out to eat, we never know if the restaurant will have a high chair, much less a booster seat for our 2 year old. This item is not only useful for these situations, but it's so light and compact that it's not a hassle to carry around. Additionally, it is perfect for packing in the suitcase. I am so glad I bought this one. And even better, my daughter loves it.",5,1
"The First Years On-The-Go Booster Seat, Safari","This is a great product! Although it is perfect for restaurants and use as a booster when travelling, I attached it to the seat in my utility cart so I can baby sit my grandson while working in the yard. Really cool the way it ""self-inflates"".",5,1
Safety 1st Comfy Bath Center in Light Blue,"This bath was the best thing that I registered for. It was so easy to use, and so comfortable for my daughter. She loved taking baths! I would fill it up and carry it out to bathe her in the living room since it was easier than the tub (when she was still laying down). She sat in this tub until about 9 months, and she was a big girl! I love how it has a water cup that comes with it, which we are still using 19 mos later, and the cup holders perfectly fit shampoo and bodywash bottles. The temperature gauge is right on, especially when you are  a new mom. My cousin just registered for the newer version of this bath in off white and green, and I HAD to get it for her, knowing how awesome it is!",5,1
Peg Perego Venezia SNG Carriage / Stroller - Chesapeake,"2003 Review: I spent four weeks researching strollers before I finally bought this one for my six-month old. My research involved going to all of the product websites, reading customer reviews, stopping people with various strollers on the street, talking with friends, and trying them each out in the stores. I had been borrowing an infant car-seat/snap-and-go combo from a friend for the first six months of my daughter's life and knew what I liked and didn't like about that stroller. In a city where your primary means of transportation is walking, a good-quality, durable stroller is critical --so you do need to spend a bit more money.After seriously evaluating the Evenflo Comfort system, the Graco Metrolite, the Combi TravelSavvy, the Maclaren Volo & Techno, the Bertini M5, the Peg Perego Pliko and this one, I had pretty much narrowed it down to the Peg Perego Venezia and the comparably priced and ubiquitous MacLaren Techno because they were the most durable and easiest to handle of the lot. The MacLaren is lighter and folds up smaller, but only marginally so, and I am forever spotting little sleeping childeren umcomfortably slumped forward in their MacLarens like coach class passengers on an overnight flight: the MacLaren's seats don't fully recline; and that is important when you are on long strolls/shopping trips that run into nap-time. Kids in MacLarens just look less comfortable and cozy than those in the Peg Perego. So after much backing and forthing, I took the chance on the Peg Perego. I'm really glad I did.I had a feeling I'd made a stellar choice as soon as I took it out of the box.  I was able to assemble it without even looking at the instructions: unlike so many items I've bought for my baby, it's operation was perfectly intuitive. It rides like a cadillac on the treacherous New York City sidewalks (pot holes, ice lumps, gravely streets, ramp-less curbs) and handles so well I can steer it with one hand --as easily as the MacLaren. It's not quite as small when folded, but it folds up so compactly into a standing position that it stays out of the way in our cramped NYC digs. It also has plenty of storage space in the lower basket that can be accessed while the seat is fully reclined (storage space is critical to the carless Manhattan resident) and it has much more of it than the MacLarens have. Note also that storage space was a deal-breaker with the Peg Perego Pliko, too: it is completely inaccessible from above --you have to slip items under a metal frame from the side. The Venezia's adjustable handle is nice and high so that you don't have to stoop to walk with it (I'm 5'7""). It's as high as the one on the MacLaren Techno. I also love the bunting that allows it to be used as a cozy baby-carriage in the winter. Another cold-weather plus: the hood folds all the way down to to completely cover the baby in case of a sudden rain or windstorm. The Venezia fabric is by far the classiest and I've gotten many a compliment on it already. Sure, it would be nice to have a parent cup-holder, but the stroller handles so well  you can hold a cup in one hand and steer with the other --and it's probably a lot safer than having a cup of liquid positioned just over the baby's head. This is a great stroller, even for the price. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially to the City-dweller.2005 Edit to this review: This stroller was great until my daughter was 18 months old. After that, it became too cumbersome to steer with the extra weight. I bought a MacLaren Volo and have used that one since. I would still use this stroller if I had another baby, but only for the first year and a half. I still recommend the Venezia, but I recommend buying the Volo when baby gets too heavy and/or when it doesn't need/can't fit in the wonderful bunting the Venezia offers.",5,1
Peg Perego Venezia SNG Carriage / Stroller - Chesapeake,"My daughter is now one years old and has had far more strollers in her first year of life than I'd care to count! I simply love strollers!So when I had the chance to by the Venezia I jumped at it!Here is what I like about it:The fabrics are some of the best in the stroller market, they're plush and well made. They're easily washed and cared for and contiune looking new for a long time! The padding on this stroller is amazing - there aren't enough words to describe it! The boot is great for keeping little ones warm and cozy - especially on those cold and rainy days (we don't get much snow here in Seattle!) When the seat is upright the hood can be brought down to the boot to make a safe enclosure from the weather! The reversalble handle is nice, as is the height adjustment on it! The new black nubby wheels handle beautifully - I know many mention having problems on uneven sidewalks, I never experienced this with the new wheels. It's easy to push, even with one hand. The new snack bar is also nice - with a cup holder and large tray area!What I didn't like so much:Despite the adjustable height handle - it's still a little too short for me (at 5'11&quot;) I did kick the back a few times. The fold is easy enough, but the hooks to keep it locked in place came off a few times, they just slide over the peg. It wasn't a big deal, but I had it open on my toe a time or two when I wasn't expecting it!Overall I think this is a great stroller once you get used to it! As with any new product reading the instructions are key - I can't even begin to count how many times I've seen a mom walking through the mall with the whole thing going sideways because she didn't lock the back wheels!This is the perfect stroller if you're looking for something plush and comfy for your little one - mine loves it! It's great for the mall and shopping, it handles amazingly well for a stroller of it's size, even with one hand. The weight isn't too bad (though I have a few 25lbs + strollers so it's all relative!)",4,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I have been using my diaper pail by Dekor for 8 months now and I love it. I have tried out a few of the others via my girlfriends, and none seem to be as easy to use and works as well.The foot pedal design to open the lid sold me. (you're hands are busy enough!) Although it can be heavier to lift due to the sealing around the edge of the lid, it gets the job done better then anything having to use my hands, and I never have a problem getting my dirty diaper in the pail due to this. The seal is worth it!The diapers drop through another door that automatically opens when you drop the diaper on it, and closes back up after by it's self.The liner bags are well designed in that you tie off the bag at the bottom, and simply fill with diapers as you would a regular trash bag (no crazy long diaper sausage!) The bottom opens up when you're ready to change the bag. It has a small ""razor edge"" (very well protected from any injury) on the inside of the door that you slice the bag off however full it is. Tie it off again at the bottom, and you're all set! (Sounds harder and more complicated then it really is.)I did hesitated at the thought of having to buy replacement bags. I bought two boxes before my daughter was born, and she is now 8 months old, and I STILL have not had to buy any more boxes yet! Not as costly as I had thought....especailly for the convienence of it all!!Smell. Well, it really does do a good job with smells. As we all know, as baby's diet changes, so does the smell of her diapers!  I'd say, I didn't smell a THING until 6-7 months old with the introduction of solids. Of course, I wouldn't want to think about how it'd be now without the Dekor! I did my research before buying a diaper pail, and in a comparision test of the top selling diaper pails, this one was the winner....especailly smell factor! Regular cleaning and Lysoling helps keep the pail as fresh as possible.I reccomend this pail to all my friends. Personal experience, reviews and word of mouth are the best way to gather your research in the quest for your perfect baby products!",5,1

Summer Infant Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor,"WOW! We love our video monitor! This has really helped our transition to getting our son into his own room at night! Our son was perfectly fine when we transitioned him to his own room, but my husband and I were a nervous wreck! This monitor helps us keep peace of mind and be able to rest. We have had minimal problems with static and the sound/picture quality is great - even the night vision feature! We can check to see his position (I am always nervous about him smooshing his face into the mattress when he rolls around), his breathing and the geographic locale of his pacifier! We get a kick out of seeing our son exploring in his crib and not even knowing he has an audience!Also, when he is napping, it makes it easy to check on him without actually entering his room - which always used to wake him up.I understand from the other reviews that durability and longevity may be an issue with this item. I can't comment on that because we have only had it for 2 months. But for us, 2 months of sleep has been worth the investment already even if it tanks later...",5,1
Eddie Bauer Car Seat Travel Bag,"Granted, we've only traveled once with this carrier bag, but it fit both our Britax infant carrier car seat AND its base and made our trip much easier. On the return trip we filled the bag with the carrier and its base and heaps of clothes and it came through perfectly. Too bad it doesn't come with a sherpa or strongman to carry it after you load it down!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"My wife loves this and I do to when I can steal it from her. I do wish that the portion that is used for the head were softer. My wife says the same thing but other than that, it's perfect. I'm sure I can perform minor surgery and take out some of the filling if it really were to bother me. It's also priced $20 less than at our local mall in Utah.",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I'm pregnant and my hips don't hurt as much from sleeping on my side as they did before the snoogle--i'm excited to cuddle with it as i'm getting into bed.  It's great when i go on my back too b/c the bottom part elevates the legs perfectly.  Only con is i get hot w/ it about 3-4 am , throw it off the bed and go back to pillow btw legs, pillow to hold, and pillow for head.  TRICK--instead of buying a pillow case for it i put my regular case on the part where my head goes and it covers just where it needs to!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I bought this pillow when I was four months pregnant and I've had it for a month now. I really love this pillow and it has made sleeping a lot more comfortable for me, and keeps me on my left side. The best thing about this pillow is that you can put it into different positions to accomodate you. Whether you want to sit up, lay down, or prop your feet up - this pillow works wonders! One reason why I did not give this 5 stars is because there is an inner crease/stiching where the head goes, and sometimes if you lay on that area unknowingly in your sleep, it will cause you some discomfort. Maybe wraping the stitched area with a blanket will help reduce the discomfort if you lay near that area. My husband and I share a queen sized bed, and we have no problem with the size of the pillow. He's also able to wrap his arms around me at night as well. Perfect pillow - must get for pregnant women...or none pregnant!",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"This pillow is wonderful. I only gave 4 stars due to the horrible texture and design of the pillow cover. The pillow itself is great. I was worried that it would not work for me as I am almost 6 feet tall but it works perfectly. I am usually a tummy sleeper and I got this to help with side sleeping during pregnancy. It really cradles my entire body and I have no need for other pillows while sleeping. It is also great for sitting up in bed, it is a great investment. I am hesitant to buy replacement covers from the manufacture because the one it came with (white/cream cover) is truly not quality. The material is rough and cheap feeling.",4,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"Bought this pillow after fighting with 3-4 different pillows each night.  Had a hard time with the head piece.  It was too thick because I like a flat pillow.  But, I kept flattening it down. Loved the flexible bottom part. I'm 5'7"" and had no trouble with the length.  It was perfect to fit under my stomach when I got bigger.  It takes up less space in the bed and my husband can cuddle up with me and the pillow from behind.  Wouled recommend looking at other sites to find the cheapest version. Got mine on sale for about $...  Make sure it comes with the pillow case!",5,1
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I bought this pillow for my wife at the start of her fourth pregnancy. She had been sleeping with numerous standard pillows and tossed and turned all night. She tells me often that this pillow makes a world of difference and provides much better support.My kids love using it for watching movies, too! The large size of the pillow makes it perfect for lounging around.I highly recommend this pillow to anyone who currently uses or is looking at purchasing a body pillow.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Dresser Top Diaper Depot,"For our first daughter, we had the skip hop toolbox diaper caddy (which is $40-50).  It was such a pain and didn't hold everything we needed (in a compact space).  So for our 2nd baby, I searched for the right diaper organizer for our changing table.  I came across this one on amazon.  The price was good, it was gender neutral - so I decided to try it.  It is perfect!  It organizes everything you need for the changing table (easy access for diapers, creams, wipes) in a small compact space.  I should've bought this one for our first baby!  What a great value!",5,1
Prince Lionheart Dresser Top Diaper Depot,"I really like this changing station organizer- I didn't think to put it on my registry an saw it when I was shopping on Amazon for other items. I really like having everything out in reach, makes changing my little one in the middle of the night even easier when I'm half asleep. It's a good size too- it doesn't take up too much room and fits the lionheart wipes warmer perfectly.",5,1
Kushies 5 Pack Reusable Ultra Diapers for Infants,"Product arrived earlier than expected :) Exactly what I had ordered - the perfect solution to my disposable diaper woes, these are the simplest reusables. Holding up great especially considering the dozens of times I've washed them already! Very happy Momma and baby!",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"I have a 3 month old baby and this pump is great for someone like me!  I'm a stay at home Mom that only works one day on the weekend.  So, I basically only need to pump 2 days a week and on certain, rare occasions.  In the beginning, I had a medium brand electric breast pump...I spent about $130.00.  It was great to use at home, but I was so embarassed to use it anywhere else.  It was soo noisy and a bit of a pain to find a comfy place to plug in to.  So, a few embarassing and noisy pumps later I opted to try the manual Isis Breast Pump.  It works great and is so quiet!!!  I love it!  I have a bigger chest and have no problems with the fitting or suction.  It works great!  I also love using the Avent bottles, so this pump seems perfect for me.  I do believe that if you're a more serious pumper and need to pump a lot, a dual electric pump would probably work better.  But if you're someone like me, or just need a simple quiet pump to take out for certain occasions, this pump is GREAT!On another note:  My electric pump quit sucking already.  I used it 2 nights ago at home and the hose inside split and cracked.  I'm glad I had this one on hand!",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"This product has made my life so much better. I have recently returned to work and wanted to make sure that I could still feed my baby 100% breast milk. (She's only 3mo old.) I had been trying to use a double electric pump for a few weeks before my return and really wasn't have much luck with it. Sometimes I'd get 1T, other times I'd get 2oz. And, this is after 45min pumping sessions, lots of massage, listening to recordings of my crying baby, etc, etc.I was in pain and I was very frustrated.I had read about the massage petals of the Avent and thought it'd be worth a try. Their advertising is spot on, I'm able to pump a full feeding for my baby in 20 mins. With each pumping session, I see between 3-5oz. Wow. My baby won't starve now. It's also very comfortable, I tried so many sizes of shields before, but the petal massager is perfect.Pros:1. Petal massager is comfortable2. Produces a fast let down3. Easy to control the suction/cycle speed4. Small/compact -- easy to carry around & you're not tethered to one spot in your home.5. No electricity required6. Low price7. Quiet compared to electric pumps8. Less equipment than an electric pump9. Actually WORKS!!!Cons:1. One side at a time2. I use both hands while I pump3. Squeaks loudHere's some feedback for the product design though:1. Some milk gets wasted because of the large space before the valve. I usually swish it around to make sure that all the milk drains into the bottle.2. There is some squeaking that occurs with each pump. I think this is because the handle rubs against the plastic cap.",5,1
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"At first, I was sceptical about buying this pump since you can only  pump one breast at a time, but I actually like this pump much better than my double electric pump by Medela. First of all, it is easier to set up (no tubing to connect and no plugs or batteries to worry about) and perfect for going back to work or vacationing. This pump is also much more comfortable and easier on the nipples than my medela double select pump. Thanks Avent!",5,1
InSTEP 5K Single Premium Jogging Stroller,"This stroller is a great buy. My 11 month old son doesn't make a sound the whole ride. He's comfortable and the ride is smooth. The seat even reclines which is nice. Easy to assemble, too. The 16 inch front wheel is the only way to go if you are a runner/jogger and this one is designed well. Target had the best price I've seen on this stroller and I did my research. It's crazy to pay hundreds of dollars for the high end brands and models unless you plan on training for lots of marathons. This one is perfect for the 5K or 10K runner in my opinion, or anyone who jogs or walks for exercise.",5,1
InSTEP 5K Single Premium Jogging Stroller,"Granted, this isnt the GREATEST jogging stroller you could buy, but for the price its great! I dont jog much with it but i walk alot and it has been perfect! I walk on side roads and its really easy to meneuver even on a curvy road. I never had a problem when i did jog with it either. I like this stroller alot!",4,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I listed this tub on my registry.  Frankly, I had no idea which tub to pick out and went with this one because of the ratings. We have been using this tub regularly for the past four months and arequite pleased.  Our daughter rests in the sling, and doesn't everslide down.  Moreover, it fits perfectly in our--two sink--kitchensink.  When she's a bit older, we will likely purchase a differentmodel, but this one has been great thus far.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","This is a cute and Great tub. I love the features it has. Fits in sink perfect, love the drain plug and the soft insert for the infants.The toddler Area I've yet to use, but it seems like it will come in handy!Angela",4,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I loved this tub for my baby when she was newborn.  The hammock was perfect. It also fits on other baby tubs.  We gave it to my sister when her baby was born.  The biggest complaint I have is the ""hump"" in the middle of the tub.  My ""little girl"" is BIG (5 months).  She's tall and chunky.  She doesn't sit up well yet so we are still using the reclined side and she is so long that she scoots over the hump and gets very uncomfortable. Other than that it has been a wonderful tub, but I would reconsider if you have a big baby.",4,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I got this bathtub as a gift and I love how I can give my little baby girl a bath in the kitchen. This tub fits perfectly in my double sink. She is right at perfect height. My only complaint is the green back really doesn't prevent baby from sliding, I have to place a small hand towel behind her back for every bath, or else she is sliding all over.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue",This is the best bathtub out there trust me! You don't even have to use the sling unless your child is very small. Our son can't hold his head up but he sits in it perfectly. The back cradles our son and his head perfectly. Don't waste your time and money on any other tub!,5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","We love this tub..the great accessory is the hammock that attaches for newborn use. Being new parents, it is a little overwhelming trying to hold a soapy slippery baby while trying to also bathe her. This hammock keeps the baby slightly submerged in the water, while keeping her nestled in the hammock. Truly makes bathing an infant a much easier task then if you were trying to hold them yourself. Fits right over the kitchen sink (we have double sink and it fits perfectly) Not sure about the accuracy of the water plug that is supposed to change colors if the water is too hot...better to just test the water yourself to be safe.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","As most of the other reviews said, this is a great tub.  Only thing I have to add is that you should also buy a tub thermometer.  The rubber stopper on the tub is supposed to change color if the water is too hot for baby-but the water has to be way too hot before it changes noticeably (it does change slightly, but you can't tell through the water).  Otherwise, this tub has been perfect for us.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","This is a fantastic baby bathtub. Fits perfectly in our kitchen sink, and can be plopped into the grownup tub, too. It gets baby through all stages, from infant to toddler. The sling/hammock that comes with it is particularly good for newborns/infants. The sling can be tossed in the washing machine. The tub has a nice holder on the end for bottles of soap and shampoo. Great tub. Can't imagine anything better.",5,1
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","This tub is so great.  I have been using it since my son's unbilical cord fell off and the design of it is really perfect for bathing young babies.  I never used the hammock feature as I found it was just easier for me to not use it, but it is good for those who would like to use it.Great buy!!!!!!",5,1
"Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat, Yellow","I was thinking there must be a reusable placemat for babies and this is perfect. I ate at a restaurant yesterday with my 10 month old daughter. She fed herself her whole meal and only 2 cheerios and one piece of fruit ended up on the floor. The tray catches most of the food and then she can just eat what has fallen into the tray. It is so great not to leave a huge mess at a restaurant. Now when she starts throwing food on the floor on purpose, that will be another story.The suction cups need to get pretty wet in order to stick, but even when they aren't stuck down the mat doesnt' move much.",5,1
Food Mill - BabySteps Kid Co 1 Pk,"Great product. Easy to use EXCEPT putting the grinding lid on. It's a little bit frustrating to get it in just the right place so it will snap in. Easy to clean, but wish they'd fix that darn top part.Highly recommended! It will grind just about anything (we've tried things like fruit salad to steak to shepherd's pie! Comes out perfect every time!)",4,1
Medela Contact Nipple Shield - Standard Size (24mm),"This was a life saver! Only thing is that I wish I had gotten the regular nipple shield instead of the contact because the cutout prevents it from adhering perfectly. But still, it adheres pretty well and saved me from exhaustion of pumping every time she was hungry (which I did for two and a half weeks before I discovered this) and helped me to transition from a bottle to proper nursing. She is now able to do without the shield but it literally saved us!",4,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottle Sealing Discs,"I have Avent bottles, but not an Avent pump, so I did not get any storage bottles.  Instead of paying $25 for a storage set, these plus the bottle screw rings cost me a total of $10, and work perfectly.  I would definitely recommend to anyone pumping and using Avent bottles (I like being able to use the 9oz size for storage, because they are much larger than what my pump came with).",5,1
Baby Magic Calming Milk Gift Set,"I think this item is the perfect shower gift. The lavender-scented wash and shampoo is not overpowering and perfumey-- I think it's just right to make an already sweet-smelling baby smell clean and fresh. The soap is gentle, it has never irritated my baby's skin or eyes. I love the music CD and the soft washcloth that comes in this set. The handy carrier keeps all the bottles upright and together so you can just grab it and set it next to the tub when you're ready for baby bath time. A  new mama can have fun using everthing in this gift bag!",5,1
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"This product is perfect! My 2 month old enjoys her alone time propped up on the pillow! It is great to know your little one is secure while you sit next to them, wash the dishes (always in my view), or even get a workout in! I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. I cannot wait to be able to use this for tummy time!",5,1
Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing Pillow And More,"I love this pillow.  I did not try the boppy first, and I don't see why I ever would.  This pillow is perfect for nursing (my baby was a preemie and the pillow was big enough to hold her up) and I love the strap option for when she gets bigger.  I also love the design.  Overall, a great product.",5,1
6 Piece Bedding Set - Paloma,"This item is just beautiful. My daughter has this for her baby. The theme is beautiful. one thing I did notice is that the fabric on the dust ruffle is very thin, so thin you can see right through it. I dont know why they didnt use the same fabric as in the curtain.It seems very easy to rip and tear on the crib. otherwise this set is just perfect.",4,1
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","My 1yo daughter has to wear a hip abduction brace at night, and it fits perfectly in this sleep sack. Absolutely awesome.",5,1
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Halo, how I love thee;) This is perfect for cold winter nights. We keep the heater off due to allergries and bundle up our little guy. He's snug as a bug.",5,1
Fisher-Price Step &amp; Play Piano,"My daughter is not quite 3 months, but already she's bored with her bouncer and doesn't want to lay in her crib and watch her mobile all day.  So, when I bought the Step N' Play piano, she absolutely loved it!  When her little feet hit those keys and the music and lights start to play she gets sooo excited.  And I'm excited because I can do more things around the house while she's occupied.  All of the brightly colored toys are set perfectly for her little arms to reach, the swivel chair and sliding feature is wonderful (she's already started to turn herself around) , as well as the mirror that she gets a kick out of looking at herself. This entertainer really keeps her attention for quite a while, and I like that the 2 sound settings aren't very loud, so the noise doesn't bother me or her or anyone else in the house. Kudos! to Fisher-Price.  I Love It!  I recommend this toy to all parents who want a safe environment to play and learn to take those first steps.",5,1
Koala Baby - Cotton Rib Blanket - Sage,"I registered for this blanket to match our crib bedding for our fist son, and it has been the best and most used blanket.  He has used it every day since birth, through all four seasons, and it has held up wonderfully--it has not torn, faded, balled or lost its softness. It is perfect for swaddling or over the carseat/stroller, and is great use anywhere because it is not too bulky.  A woman once commented that is looked like a handmade heirloom-like blanket because it was so soft and had a beautiful pattern, and she was surprised to hear it was store bought.Now that my son is older, he takes it off of his bed and carries it around.  It has become his favorite blanket!  Since we are using the same crib bedding for our second child, I have registered for this one again in yellow!  I highly recommend this blanket for your little one.",5,1
Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer,"My daughter was potty trained at about 20 months old, shes 3 now and this is the best little seat.WE trained her on a standalone at first, terrible. It was a missery to clean and it was gross. It was very small (yet my daughters in the 32nd percentile!) and very annoying. It took up ALOT of space in my LARGE bathrooms, yet the seat was very tiny as I had already mentioned. It leaked and discouraged my daughter, she thought she was ""doing it wrong"". The potty was uncomfortable and was constantly sliding all over the place. I really felt bad for my little baby.So we bought a cheap potty insert, this didnt fit the potty and frightened my little girl when it would wobble and slide. There was really no place to keep it and the soft vinyl seat cover was ripping, UHG.So finnaly we heard about the Bjorn. It deffinatly fit perfectly, with just a twist of the knob it can fit ANY toilet. It isnt in the way anymore because it can be hung on a little hook (my daughter takes great pride in taking it on and off). Its very comfortable but it doesnt have ripping vinyl material, its all one piece of sturdy plastic. I love that its not too cold for my girls tushie in the mornings, and it can retain the heat pretty well (my friend has a potty seat that she has to place a blanket over it so afterwards it wont be too freezing for her daughter to sit on it!) Its definatly easy to clean, just a little baby wipe and its all done, no little creveces to get ""god knows what"" stuck to it, YUCK. The little splash guard can work for boys (My son (6) has tried it, although he was very uncomfortable because of the fact that he stands, but other than that he said it was fine) but its not too annoying for girls, she has never been bothered or hurt by it at all, she actually enjoys holding it! The seat is nice a white, making it easy to spot ""dirt"" and keep it clean, its also nicer than those cheezy charecter ones.This seat is by far the best on the market, I cant complain and I am thinking of purchasing another one for our 2nd bathroom (although they are expensive!)",5,1
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"After searching high and low for the perfect activity center I finally bought this for my five month old son. He absolutely loves it!! He loves the bright colors, music, lights and of course all the fun toys. As a matter of fact when we had to leave this morning he got made because he wanted to continue to play!! I thought that it was easy to put together all you have to do is follow the instructions. I am glad that i spend the extra $ on this activity center because it is well worth it!",5,1
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,"We have the Sparkling Symphony Gym at home, and just got this gym at my baby's grandparents' house.  I like this better because you can convert it for a baby to play lying down, sitting or standing, while the SSG works only lying down or standing (not sitting).  My 7-mo-old is at the sitting stage so this is perfect for her, and will last quite a long time as she can use it while standing.  The music is quite nice -- something you won't get sick of when listening to it over and over.  It's very easy to put together.  My baby seems to love it -- she whacks at the keys, smiles really big, and bounces her whole body up and down as she plays the piano.",5,1
The First Years Swing Tray - Portable Booster Seat Blue &amp; Aqua,"We got this chair as a baby shower gift, which I registered for and absolutely love it!  I don't understand the problems the other reviewers are talking about.  If used properly, this chair gives absolutely no problems.  The seat locks in at different levels, if it's not locked in, of course it will fall apart.The seat is easy to use, folds easily, and cleans easily.  We store it in our van (we have Stow-and-go storage) and it fits perfectly!We've used it since my son, now 16 months, could sit up.  He lays his body from side to side and the seat doesn't budge...very safe.  The tray does snap off easily, and he has done that at times while trying to climb up on it.  This doesn't bother me, since it's not a 'toy' and shouldn't be climbed on anyway.  The tray hasn't snapped off while in use, and hopefully won't!We've used this chair on both a chair, and the floor when seating was limited (like at family get togethers).  We haven't had any problems at all.Anyway, I highly recommend it...",5,1
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver","I found the best price for these is here on Amazon. The base fit into my Dodge Ram back middle seat perfectly and the LATCH system keeps it very secure. However, my wife's car does not have LATCH and we were required to use the seat belt. Her car has leather seats and the front of the base slides side to side on the leather no matter how tight the seat belt is, the sliding does not happen in the Dodge Ram.",4,1
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver",We needed an extra base for our infant carseat. Looked up the model of the seat and the base works perfect.,5,1
Playtex Premium Nurser Newborn Gift Set,"My daughter has no trouble switching between these bottles and the breast.  I tried the Avent ones with her and the milk came out too fast.  These are perfect, easy to clean, and reasonably priced.",5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Halo is the first baby clothes thing I have seen that seems to be size accurate!  I swear the rest of the clothes are sized by people on crack they are so random.  So my little one is 7 months, 18 lbs, and 28 inches long.  I crossed my fingers and got him the large.  I would not put it on a baby any smaller either in length or height, but he managed to squeak in without worrying about it falling off.  If you are not quite so financially strapped I would recommend getting the size accurate to your baby :-)The sack is soft, nice weight, and I love the open arms so that I can put any variety of short-sleeve, long-sleeve onesies or even pajamas underneath.  The extra layer is not too much for heat, but just enough protection so that those early morning leaks in the full diaper from 12 hours of sleep don't go through onto the sheet.  Yay!  I also love the bottom zipper and the amount of room to grow.  Even if I had purchased the correct (medium) size for mine he would have had space.  He is perfectly happy sleeping in it and I will be buying more!",5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I'm a fan of the HALO sleepsacks and their functionality. It could be a positive or negative thing but this 100% Cotton HALO is made of very light and thin cotton material which is a lot different than the fleece HALO sleepsacks that I'm used to buying. However, when the weather gets really hot during the summer, I think this will be the perfect solution so I bought a larger size for my son to grow into it to use it during the warmer months.",4,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",We have used this since we quit swaddling him as a newborn. We use the cotton one year around and it is the perfect weight here in Texas. We only use the fleece one when it becomes really cold. He is 15 months old and he associates the sleepsack with sleepytime. I never have to worry about him being cold or kicking off his blankets-totally recommend!!!,5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",LOVE this sleepsack.  It's only one layer of cotton fabric and quite large.  I went from using a 0-6 month one (of another brand) to a medium Halo Sleepsack.  It's perfect.  My 7 month old has quite a bit of room to grow.  I do expect to buy another one until he's at least 12 months old.,5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",So happy we decided to get this sleep sack. Even though I read the reviews about these running big I still went with an large and even ordered an XL to have has a backup for when our little one gets bigger. My almost 6 month old began to roll over in his sleep and this sleep sack gives me peace of mind. No worries about him getting wrapped up in a blanket. The cotton is soft & adds the perfect amount of warmth to his footie pj's.,5,1
Dreamscapes Soother,"I have to agree with the reviews that you will go through quite a few batteries but not as often as what I thought after reading some of the reviews.  But it is well worth it, especially when your child learns to turn it on themselves and goes back to sleep, giving you an extra hour of sleep!  Our daughter is now a year old, and still loves this toy and we take it wherever she will be sleeping, even for naps.  The volume can be adjusted to suit your preference and the moving pictures are very calming and slowly dim as the music becomes softer. It is super easy to take on and off of the crib and can set on a dresser or shelf if you would like.  We had the aquarium crib toy and found it to be loud and didn't play long enough at one time.  The Dreamscape Soother is the perfect choice for any baby!",4,1
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM NOT TOO LONG AGO AND IT IS GREAT. PERFECT FOR QUICK SHOPPING AND EASY TO MANAGE. LIGHT WIEGHT, CAN OPEN AND CLOSE WITH ONE HAND. FOR SHORT TRIPS AND WALKS IN THE MALL IT IS GREAT. WE USE ARE PRAM FOR LONG WALKS BUT FOR EVERYTHING ELSE WE USE THIS WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!",5,1
"Dr. Brown's 8 oz. Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 3 Pack","My son took a bottle for the first time around 4 weeks of age.  We would try to give him one bottle a day while I nursed him the other feedings.  Because of many recommendations, I went out and bought loads of Avent bottles, but when my son drank from them, he gulped, choked, and got milk all over himself (even after trying all of the nipple sizes).  Finally, he began to reject the bottle and I was forced to be at home every time he needed to eat so I could nurse him.  That loss of freedom hit me hard, so in desperation, I went out and got a Dr. Brown's bottle, because they were another brand that I saw had great recommendations.  With the first try, he took the Dr. Brown's bottle perfectly!  There was no gulping, choking, or mess, and I received some of my freedom back!  My son is happier, I'm happier, and I'm thankful for Dr. Brown's bottles for making that happen.",5,1
"The First Years 4 Pack Take And Toss Spill Proof Cups, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary","A handful of throwaway sippy cups are good to have on hand (and in the diaper bag). Not that I'm advocating trashing these after use (they're perfectly washable), but your wallet won't care so much when your child chucks one of these into the okapi enclosure at the zoo. (The zookeepers care. Yes, they do.)",4,1
"The First Years Take &amp; Toss Toddler Bowls, 8 Ounce, 6 Pack",These are the perfect size storage bowls for a child's snack. I also used them to store cereal for my infant (I make homemade cereal and the batch usually lasts three days so I can portion them correctly using these bowls. The lid is great because my older child (1-2) can carry them around the house and not spill anything.,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Level 3 Standard Nipple, 3 Pack","I have long been a fan of Dr Browns. We purchased these nipples for feeding our baby formula with rice cereal. He has reflux so he has to have the formula thickened with the cereal. Ihad a hard time choosing between these and the Y cut nipples. I had used the Y cut nipples in the past for our son who was a preemie and had to have his formula mixed with alot of rice cereal. I was afraid Y cut nipples would flow too fast with only a small amount of cereal added. The nipples work perfect. They are also more durable than the Y cut nipples, which do break easily. Also, these are the best bottles for colic and gas.",5,1
Harmony Breastpump,"I have the electric Pump-In-Style and I prefer to use the Harmony 9 times out of 10. It's very quick to set up, easy to use and easy to clean.  I think it works as well as the electric, but if you're pumping constantly throughout the day, the electric would be better for you. I'm a stay at home mom and I only need to pump occassionally (nights out away from baby, during naps to stock milk supply in freezer, etc) and I think this pump works perfectly!",5,1
La Petite Bebe 6 Piece Bedding Set,"This being my first child and a girl, I really wanted to make her nursery a little girl's dream. When I saw this bedding set online I knew this was the one. Not only do you get the complete bedding set, including the dust ruffle, but you also get the window valance and the diaper stacker!!! What a deal for the price considering that most quality bedding sets only come with the comforter and sheets for the same price as the La Petite Bebe bedding. When the set arrived I was so excited, the bedding screams quality. You can see it everywhere, not just on first visual inspection but in the design and the construction! We also ordered the wall border, which matches perfectly with the bedding sets. Sometimes the border color and bedding colors vary slightly but these colors are an exact match!! My daughter is a dream come true and so is her nursery with the addition of La Petite Bebe bedding!!! I highly recommend this bedding set!",5,1
All Stars 6 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"I received this as a gift for my son. Obviously because I don't see paying this amount for crib bedding. That's my only complaint, the price. I mean, they're going to pee, poop and spit up all over it and when they're done with it - it's done. With my daughter we had just a $50 set from Walmart. I was pleased with that. Everyone talked about how much nicer the quality is of these sets. I do agree that the quilt is really nice, and I like that everything is in the set together. It's absolutely perfect in his nursery, and I love it, My ties are on the top and bottom of the bumper, I remember reading someone said theirs didn't have them. I would have returned it! None the less, I love the set, i wouldn't have bought it myself solely on price, but it is very nice.",4,1
Sassy Soft Sided Toy Organizer,This toy organizer has worked out perfectly for us. I love that it is soft so I know my daughter wont get hurt in any way. She has even enjoyed playing with the play mat. It's also great because it has a section which can be pulled out so we can bring some of the toys into a different room. Overall I think this was a great purchase.,4,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundle Me, Graphite",I received this as a shower gift. Living in North Dakota where winter temps get below zero a lot I was dreading having to bundle my baby in a bulky snowsuit. I have yet to put him in one. The Bundle Me keeps him warm and cozy. He doesn't like having anything touching his face so instead of pulling the top cover over his face we just throw a light blanket over the handle of the carseat to keep out the wind. We even used the Bundle Me on our trip to Southern California. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. I plan to buy the Big Bundle me for next winter.PS. We were frustrated at first because the zipper kept getting stuck in the lining but we solved that by placing our finger in front of the zipper while zipping it to move any of the lining out of the way. Now it works perfect.,5,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundle Me, Graphite","I first purchased mine two years ago when my first son was two weeks old.  I had seen this product and thought it was too pricy; however, after two weeks of stuffing my little man into a snow suit I decided to try it.  I was sold immediately.  I know some people feel the baby still needs a jacket but I don't.  I live in NY where it can get quite cold and I only used the bundleme with a winter hat, never a coat.  If I was talking a walk with the baby which only happen a few times given the temperature outside, I put a blanket in the bundleme for some extra protection.  But if you are going from house to car, car to store, the Bundleme paired with a nice warm winter hat, is all that is needed.  I was sold the first time I used it.  Two months ago my second son was born and I am using the same Bundleme for him.  It has held up perfectly, even after being washed regularly.  I would never use a snowsuit on an infant again!!!",5,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,As a teacher I wanted something to stimulate my little one without flashing lights and music.  Just pure and simple.  Exactly what a baby wants and needs! As a Mom I wanted something my baby could enjoy and grow with.  This looked perfect and proved to be exactly that.  Every couple of months I change the cards and my baby falls in love with this all over again.  The product is also well made.  Very happy with this! And it was reasonably priced.  Seriously happy with this in every way shape and form!,5,1
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"I looked high and low for a mobile for my baby boy that didn't have lace and polka dots, footballs, and fruffy puppies on it. I didn't want anything too completely modern that was decorated more for preserving the parent's home decor than it is for fun time for the baby. I'm so glad I found this. I love that the pictures face towards the baby and are interchangeable.  It comes with links to adjust the height according to the baby's age and eyesight range. He really enjoys it and doesn't seem to get tired of it. I got a baby mobile music box on eBay for $10 and attached it. Perfect.",5,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"I bought these because they had over body straps.  My girlfriends twins, both boys, were about 15 months old but very active.  They would not sit down at the table or their existing chairs.  They learned to climb out of normal leg straps and it did not stop them.  This made meal time impossible.  These chairs made it possible for them to sit at the table with us but also be strapped in.They are easy to clean and easy to put on the table.  My guess is some tables may not work well so I would check. However these worked perfectly for us.  Also the price was insanely low for how well these are made.  THey are listed as portable but I can tell you we use them daily and do not move often only for cleaning.Fast forward a year and we are still using them.  They learned how to get out of the straps but for the most part stay seated.  However I will say the abuse the two give these surprises me.  They have held up for almost a year now of constant abuse.  These days they even jumped in them (obviously stopped quickly and yelled at) and they stay attached.Basically, if your child or children are active and you are looking for a good seat these are it.  At $20 or less you cannot go wrong.",5,1
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"You get what you pay. Practical, okay quality, steady, safe, affordable. There are other hook-on chairs out there that are more expensive, but probably better quality. This chair however is perfect for us. Just what I was looking for. I was looking for something practical and affordable to use only for a few months while we are away from home. We have one chair similar to this back at home but of a better quality. I wanted something similar but I didn't want to pay too much. I am happy with the product. My baby likes it too! We can all sit and have dinner together around the table.",5,1
"Safety 1st Designer Infant Car Seat Base, Black",I was exhausting with switching car seat bases and this seat perfectly fits for the Safety 1st travel system  that I purchased at Target. I received it quickly and it snapped in perfectly for my husband's truck. This is a great buy!!,5,1
Jumpster Doorway Jumper - Jackpot,"I have this jumper, just in a different pattern. My son is going to be four months old soon and is VERY tiny. But he is a very active little boy and I knew he needed something fun to do. I didnt want to introduce an exersaucer until about 5 months because its too overstimulating. This jumper is very very nice. I keep his favorite blankets around him and he loves it. He cant bounce too well but he loves the position and if you bounce it for him. It fits in any doorway with a molding over head. It is very very easy to install (took about 25 minutes) and it is very easy to move. Even though it is easy to move, it is very stable. It will not fall and it can withstand even my 2 1/2 year old standing on the seat and ""swinging"". It is actually very easy to adjust (my friends daughter is 4 1/2 months and a BIG GIRL). My son loves to be in this and it was the perfect solution to my problem. I am also happy that when he does get an exersaucer, we will be able to ""rotate"" him from jumper to saucer. I cant see anything more you would want in a doorway bouncer, and it is much safer, more comfortable, LESS room, and more fun than the jumparoo!",5,1
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,"I registered for this item because it looked very ""comfy,"" and I am very glad I did.  My daughter was only 5 pounds when she was born, and this was the only item besides her bassinet that she could use.  At 2 1/2 months, she is still using it.  I love the portablility of it; I can put her in it whenever I need my hands free, and she is perfectly happy.Also, she has reflux and this seat keeps her upright enough to avoid any spitting up or other problems.  I would recommend it to anyone!",5,1
Fisher-Price: Link-a-doos Open-Top Take-Along Swing,This swing is perfect to take anywhere. It folds nicely and unfolds with ease. My baby is 15lbs and it works at all speeds. He loves to look in the mirror and play with the links. I recomend this swing to anyone who wants a travel swing or seat. I have found Fisher-Price has the best products........I only wish I knew before I had my baby!!:),5,1
The First Years Everywhere Gate,"These gates are very sturdy and they are very nice if you fasten them into your door frame. I have 3 little dogs and keep them out of the bedrooms in the daytime, these work perfect.",5,1
The First Years Everywhere Gate,"We used to use one to protect my daughter from a stairway when she was very young and it was perfect. Now, we're using it to keep a puppy confined to the kitchen during the times we're not home.It works splendidly, for both uses! We never fixed it to the wall although it does with all the proper hardware to do this. We found the tension fit was more than enough.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",We bought this because our grandson was visiting for Christmas. It was perfect. Easy to clean and transport. Well worth the investment.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",We received this as a gift and it is probably the best item we received.  We live abroad and travel a great deal.  We take this with us everywhere.  It is lightweight and fits in the overhead bins of airplanes easily.  As soon as she was sitting on her own we started using this chair. Our little girl sits at the table with us everywhere now and loves being up at eye level with us while we eat.  When she is ready to eat the seat is perfect.  No highchair needed at our house!,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","It's fine, what can I say? Haven't used any other so no idea what the industry standard is. My only complaints are really minor, not deal breakers but enough to wish on a rating star for.Good news:It appears durable enough, we've been using it about a year now but only for travel, which we don't do all that often.The way it straps on to the back and bottom of a chair feels really secure.Easy to cleanI like that it includes a tray cover to keep the part they eat from clean when travelingWhat could be better:The ""boost"" doesn't go so high, could probably use a bit more height for short kids.The tray is kind of low when babies start to grow a bit, there's not a lot of space between the baby's thighs and the tray. My kid is even on the petite side. I realize part of the point of the booster is to raise the kid to reach the adult table, but sometimes you just don't want 'em there. But overall I imagine a heftier kid than mine would probably start to feel squished in this seat sooner than you'd want.The inner (white) tray snaps off MUCH too easily. I was looking forward to having it both as a spare and to be able to easily bring it to the sink to rinse off, but instead I rarely use it and it's just an extra piece in the way because from the very beginning my 1-year-old could easily pry it off and send food flying. No good.And this is not a problem with the product, in fact it's exactly as described, but I just think people should know this is NOT a full high chair replacement. That would be the excellent ""Space Saver"" booster which I'm about to review. But even though I didn't start my little one on table food until she was able to sit independently anyway, the seat of this booster was still not supportive enough for her at that point (I think she was about 9 months old when we first got this) - she was too little and wiggly and it just wasn't the same as high chair seats usually are more contoured. The tray is small too, which is perfect for travel and toddlers but not ideal for beginning eaters who don't yet understand how to keep their food in one place.Overall, this is an item that I'm very happy to have in my car trunk, but for home I'd probably get a more basic booster when my kid outgrows the high chair. The trays would be squashing her legs by that point and the boost isn't so high, I think most plainer seats would do the job very well or better for home. But for traveling with a baby to toddler, it's near perfect.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",Omg! Great product great price. Our kitchen is to small for  high chair. This product is perfect.Well worth the money.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",Bought this for my granddaughter. Love it because there's no fabric and the mess is easily wiped up. Nothing to wash after she eats. Lovelies I can push my chair in under the table with it attached. Fits perfectly.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",I was searching for a booster for our table that would be suitable for a two year old. This one is perfect!! He loves it and it seems to be very comfortable for him. There are 3 height settings which is great for different tables. Easy to clean and they extra tray is nice!,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This chair is perfect for grandparents or anyone who has a little one who visits and is eating solid food.The chair is sturdy, fits on a chair easily and is easy to clean. I like it because it doesn't take up a lot of room,yet supports my grandson during feeding time. Tray and height are adjustable.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This really is perfect for home and travel to gram's house.  We take it everywhere.  Many restaurant's high chairs are not always clean enough.  It is easy to adjust the height and adjust the straps for any chair and table.  We haven't had one situation where we could use it.  Seat back folds down and has a handle and you can secure the seat table with the straps and everything stays tight during travel.  If you are limited on space, get this over a free standing child high chair.  We don't have a child high chair only this and don't regret it.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",This is a perfect size booster with nice trays.  Great neutral colors.  Perfect for our needs at a good price!,5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","The straps that clip around and under the kitchen chair are really sturdy. The seat itself does not feel cheap, and it is easy to take the tray on and off. My daughter seems to fit in it perfectly even though she's really small. When she's done eating I wipe the tray off and it fits great in the dishwasher.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We had this shipped to my Mom's prior to our visit with our 10-month-old. It is perfect for traveling. Our son could sit up comfortably, be safely strapped in, and it can be easily cleaned. We put the trays right in the dishwasher. I would recommend this for anyone that takes road trips or travels frequently with your baby.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This could possibly be the best item I purchased for our baby to date.  We started using this seat when our daughter was 5 months and now she is 8 and we just love it.  I did alot of research on all of the baby items on our registry and boy am I glad.  We have a small apartment, so room for a full size highchair doesn't exist.  This seat is perfect.  Even if you do have room, this is still perfect.  It's so nice, durable and easy to clean.  We take it to restaurants with us, and it's not a hassle at all.  I almost feel proud for being such a great consumer.  People always ask us about the seat when we go out.  The carrying strap is so nice, it even has velcro to hold the strap in place so that it doesn't dangle.  My daughter absolutely loves it too.  You will feel the same way, I'm positive!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I love this booster!It fits our average (maybe even smaller than average) sized kitchen chairs when other similar products did not.Easy to clean, easy to use, works perfectly, etc... Honestly, no complaints.I highly recommend it for anyone living in a small space. I also recommend it for anyone who is looking for a chair that will last a long time. I bought my first one when my baby was 6-months, just starting to sit at the table. She's now almost 3-years-old and still fits in it and it is in like-new condition. I purchased a second one for baby #2 and it's holding up just as well after 7 months of use.Great item! In fact, one of my Top 10 Must Have Kid Items!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Agree with all the positive reviews--this seat is awesome--it's compact (fits perfectly on a regular dining chair and is very easy to assemble/pack up), lightweight, and easy to clean (no fabric, yay!). The removable (dishwasher safe) tray makes it just that much easier to clean, which is a plus. Our large 8-month-old seems both comfortable and secure (hasn't found a way to escape yet). Plus you can't beat the price.",5,1
Black Diaper Bag,"I have tried MANY diaper bags over the course of my son's first year.  He is almost 14 months now and this diaper bag is absolutely perfect for him.  However, imagining having this bag during his first few months would be difficult.  In the beginning I carried A LOT!  Now his daily needs have downgraded to just a few items and this bag has worked best.  The bag is perfect for my toddlers needs and I also have room for my keys, wallet, lipstick, etc.  The cell phone carrier on the strap is a super great idea because I usually don't have time to dig for it in the bag while on the run.  It's a comfortable bag to wear for me, although it does get a little heavy when I've worn it for long periods of time.  My husband loves it also and he doesn't find the weight to be bothersome, even when I've jam packed it with all of our needs.  I bought this bag anticipating it will be well used on our upcoming trip to Disney World.  I believe I have made a wise purchase!",4,1
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"Although many reviews have been bad for this monitor, we got this as a shower gift and have found it to work perfectly.  There is zero static and it picks up my baby's every little sound.  I was actually amazed at how well it picked up his sounds.  However we live in a rural area, so maybe that has something to do with a clear signal/no static.  I would definitely recommend it for the price.",4,1
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,So what if there is a little fuzz when the monitor is turned up all the way!  It works perfectly and even picks up little birdies chirping outside.  It is a must have!  I can take a bath and know that I will be able to respond to her when she needs me.,5,1
Trend Lab Butterfly Wall Clock,"Exactly what I was looking for!! So stinkin cute, goes with everything in my kitchen perfectly, couldn't be more happy with this product.",5,1
"RayShade&reg; UV Protective Stroller Shade Improves Sun Protection for Strollers, Joggers and Prams Navy","This is a great way to add shade.  Especially since my jogger, which was handed down to me, has a very small shade.  This adds the perfect amount.  Its also stretchy which makes it cover even more areas.  Only concern I have is the straps aren't so stretchy, and I tend to pull a little to much omly to make sure little feet are covered.  I may have to reinforece them with a little sewing.  Overall its done what I needed it too.",4,1
Kidkusion Kid Safe Banister Guard,"We bought this to protect our 18 month old from running through our banister.  Unfortunately our spindals are too far apart from each other, making it possible for her to fall down a flight of stairs if she wasn't careful.I was eager to put it up, so I didn't wait for husband to get home to help.  It took me a good 2.5 hours to put it up.  It was too wide for our railing, so I had to cut it to make it fit.  I used my rotary cutter used for fabric to cut through the plastic, which worked great.My husband was worried that it would look cheap and he actually doesn't mind it. And I personally don't mind it either, I actually barley notice it anymore.  I'd rather pay $35 for this plastic than redo our banister. My only complaint is that it's annoying to clean off.  The side that faces you is easy to clean, the other side however is tricky.  Since it is plastic, you can see finger prints and smudges pretty easily.If you are looking for an inexpensive fix, this is what you are looking for.  I don't worry about my child's safety concerning our staircase anymore.  She isn't able to push through it, so it perfect for right now!",4,1
The First Years: Clear and Near 2.4 GHz Monitor,"Wow!  This product was pricey but the difference was amazing.  This product not only gets chrystal clear reception, it amplifies as well.  I put the receiver eight feet away from my daughter and can still hear her breathing. This is very reassuring, especially when she is sick.  After returning six different monitors, this has been the perfect monitor for her grandparent's home because the house is simply too large for the 900 Mhz models.  Note:  Neither my in-laws nor my house has a 2.4 GHz telephone or equipment that apparently interferes with the reception.",5,1
Twin Swift Stroller -Navy w/ Mesh Basket,"I love this double stroller for many reasons. My 9 month olds are very squirmy, but I couldnt stand the SUV double that we owned before... I love the swift.At BRU we test drove a few strollers (after returning our borowed DuoGlider to the original owner... more of a sigh of relief than a sigh of anger!)Well we tried the DuoRider... This stroller was completely inferior to any double I had ever laid eyes on! The straps were flimsy lapbelts, there was minimal storage, only ONE canopy to cover both children (plus I cant imagine an average 3 year old fitting in it) it was too large, yet the seats were too cramped. The wheels were flimsy and squeaky, it was just horrible.I saw the double Jeep stroller, it was definatly an umbrella stroller. It was just TOO umbrella like, and it was too ""unsafe"" for the twins...So we laid eyes on the Swift. It was the double umbrella with a few bonuses that we were looking for.Its sturdy, that means the wheels wont spontaniously fall off like on the DuoGlider. I loved how easy it was to steer and manuver, and that it was very easy to turn as well. I absolutly LOVED that it could fold easily, but DEFINATLY not with one hand. It folds pretty small, and can fit well into the trunk of my minivan. I also love that the stroller is ""lightweight"", at 28 lbs... thats not too heavy, but not really too lightweight either. Theres 5 point harnesses for them, this was a big deciding factor on the swift, and they are well padded and secure. The seats reqline (another feature that we needed) and they reqline FULLY and sit up FULLY. The seats are easy to take off and wash, and equally easy to wipe up. They are comfortable, and definatly not the kind of material that makes children swet 5 liters! the handles are high enough for my husband, but also easy for me to hold as well. I love that they can hold bags on them also, this is ideal since the storage is minimal. We can fit a thin diaperbag in one (with diapers, wipes, powders, bottles, onesies, and two thin blankets) I also found that in the other basket I can fit children jackets, and a small purse for me. I purchased an add on stroller accesory kit which came with a drink holder for us, a snack cup for the kids, and a compartment for keys and a cellphone... Thats the only thing that we dont like about the stroller is the lack of cupholders and accessory holders for everyone. I love this stroller, since it fits through most doorways, and since its great outdoors and indoors. Great at parks, airports, malls, zoos, aquariums, beaches, up hills, and ""off road"".I think we will have this stroller for atleast a few more years, its sturdy, reliable, and much simpler than the extravegant (and inferior) graco models... yet perfect for babies as well as toddlers.",5,1
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"I had this when my daughter was a baby.  It was perfect.  It's soft, sturdy, easy to clean, and had great features.  I loved the part at the bottom.  I breastfed and this made my life so much easier.  It made cosleeping safer.",5,1
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"We LOVED this item.  We were concerned about rolling over on our daughter while we had her sleeping in our bed, so this item avoided that problem.  We could check on her during the night and feed her without getting out of bed.  We used it for the first nearly 4 months, until she actually got so big that we cut the end off (obviously, not recommended) so she could stretch her legs for the last few weeks (she was unusually tall at 4 months, at 27"").  I can see using this only with a king-sized bed.  One would be too cramped in a queen-sized bed.  Note that each parent will have to use separate top blankets and sheets on either side of the sleeper.  The only downsides were (1) the nightlight, which I found useless because the light points up and so did not illuminate her face.  However, the light is removable, so I suppose one could use it by taking it out.  And (2), the manufacturer did not make extra fitted sheets last time I checked.  The sheet has velcro which keeps the little mattress in place (although it does not move much), and loose sheets are not recommended for reasons of safety.  Therefore, if the sheet gets soiled in the middle of the night, then good luck.  The mattress did flatten a little where her head was by the end of 4 months.  I have seen comments that the mattress is not soft, but it's really softer than our crib mattress.  The entire unit is machine washable (once certain parts are removed, which is easy), and we dried the whole thing in the dryer.  We would have brought the sleeper with us on a trip we took after she turned 4 months if she hadn't grown out of it so early.  The item was perfect until we transitioned her to her crib at 4 months.",5,1
OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack (White),"You need the warmer for reusable wipes. I have the Prince lionheart : )All the hype about bamboo sold me ... I bought the bamboo, even after reading the bad reviews ... shame on me! They did fall apart! I did not dry them, washed them on gentle, took care of them, but sadly, even after the first wash they started to fray and just fall apart. I ordered these at the same time, and, as stated in the reviews, these are great! They have held up perfectly!They not only held up, but also, you can put far more of these into the wipe warmer! That is important, because you will go through them lolI never dry them! I take them from the wash, fold them, put about 2-3 tablespoons of witch hazel in a gladware bowl with warm water then I drop them in folded, get them wet (not too wet) then transfer them to the warmer. I pour the remaining water/witch hazel into the bottom of the warmer to keep the pad wet (pad for the lionheart warmer) and done!Love these!",5,1
OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack (White),"I have tried other cloth wipes brands and love these the best.  They are super soft and fluffy, and the stitching around the edge holds up to frequent washing.  They are also a nice size: not too big, not too small.  Just perfect!!",5,1
OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack (White),"I am one of those people who has to try one of everything. I have theThirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boy, the Imported Flannel Wipes 15 pack - All unbleached, and some two sided 100% cotton terry cloth wipes from Green Mountain Diapers. In my opinion they all have pros and cons it really just depends what you are looking for.The Thirsties are by far the softest, even after washing in our very hard water. After a couple months the colors have stayed well and they are the cutest. I like the two sides, the longer side is great for getting bulk and the other side is very soft and gets anything that's left behind. They are the largest but fit ok (about 12) in my Prince Lionhart warmer if they are folded in half. They do kind of stick together so pulling one out one handed is more difficult. If you want something really soft and cute, go with these.The flannel wipes are the most cost-effective option. They are thin and sometimes require a little bit more scrubbing to get sticky messes clean. They are pretty soft also. The best thing about this is you don't have to worry about running out of wipes in the middle of a diaper change. You can fit at least 30 wipes folded in half in a warmer. They are also wash cloth size so they cover your hand well and I like that I don't have to worry about using too many wipes. So if you're looking for cost effective and ease of use I would go with these.The 100% cotton wipes are nice because they clean messes really well and they are fit to go into a warmer, so I don't have to do any fancy acrobatics to unfold anything. These are the least soft of the 3 and even though they aren't folded they take up a lot of room in the warmer and don't fit perfectly (the edges come up). They say they are two sided but I don't like using the smooth side at all, it doesn't seem to have much use to me. They are also smaller and so I usually have to use more and I end up with stuff on my hands more often than with the others. If you like 100% cotton these would be an ok choice but honestly I would probably go with Under The Nile Organic Cotton Baby Wipes - 6 Pack which sound like they're softer.",5,1
OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack (White),"These wipes are perfect for making your own wipe mixture and avoiding chemical on your baby's skin. And sooo much more cost effective. I had thrown away hundreds of disposable wipes before I got these and they are just as soft. They don't ""slide"" as easily unless you get your soap/oil/water mixture right, that takes some experimenting. I just wash them along with the cloth diapers and then drop them back in a disposable wipe container filled with my soapy mixture, easy as pie. Unbleached is a plus too: no bleaching chemicals and stains don't show up as easily. Sunlight takes care of stubborn stains.",5,1
Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail,"First I want to say - buy this or something BEFORE your baby starts to gnaw on the crib. By the time that happens, the idea of doing a little research and ordering something online goes out the window. What are you doing baby! That's your awesome crib we bought and lovingly put together for you!I can be a bit of a perfectionist, so I took all the time to read the directions, apply the alcohol, wait for it to dry, etc. Even trying to be as careful as could be, I had a lot of trouble getting these to go on the crib straight. Not a big deal for some. For others, it may totally ruin the whole appearance of the crib to have a crooked, wavy crib rail. It would have been easier to keep straight if I started in the middle and pushed the sides down evenly, but I wanted to leave a little bubble of air under the top to provide some extra cushion.One last tip - it can take a couple of days for the adhesive to really set, so again, don't wait until your baby is already chewing things up, or this thing will probably just get pulled off. Once the adhesive has really set, you may be more worried about pulling paint off the crib when (if) it comes time to take this off.",4,1
Sea Life Wall Hanging,I just rec'd these today and I used velcro stickers to hang them they worked great.  It is the perfect finishing touch to our baby's room.  It is a must have if you have the bedding set.  SO CUTE!,5,1
BabyTrend ActivPak in Black,"I ordered this bag the week after our son was born and we take it EVERYWHERE!  We have used this bag for 16+ months now and that means EVERYDAY!  My son came to work with me for the first year of his life (a huge blessing -- I know) and the bag carried everything I needed...all of his stuff, my breast pump, extra bottles, my lunch, and even doubled as my purse for that first year (because you don't have enough hands otherwise!).  This bag is absolutely perfect and is still like brand new -- which is great as I'll be using it for baby #2 who is on the way and it will be used as everything once again!",5,1
"Philips Avent 10 Pack BPA Free Breast Milk Storage Starter Set, Clear, 6 Ounce","I never used these for milk storage, but I use it for everything else. The twist cap makes it foolproof and easy to use. It took me some time to discover it was a twist cap, since I thought it was a snap on, but my kids can't open them without my help. I think they don't realize it is a twist cap. Perfect for snacks, just the right amount.",4,1
Medela One-Piece Breastshield w/ Valve and Membrane,"This replacement piece works better than the original that came with my pump. It is an excellent value, fits with the hoses and bottles perfectly, and has better suction.",5,1
Medela Spare Membranes for Breatpumps 6 Pack,"OEM membranes work perfectly - and if you're having problems with building or maintaining your milk supply or getting enough suction from your pump, try replacing these.  HUGE difference IMO!",5,1
Arm's Reach Natural Original Co-Sleeper,"I love our Co-sleeper!!! We have twin boys and they are 13 weeks and just now transitioning into their cribs. They have sleep in the co-sleeper since coming home and it is perfect! The original size is great for twins or for one baby who is bigger. The weight limit is 30 lbs. for the higher level which sold us as the pack n'plays are only 15 lbs. I can't recommend this enough, it truly has been a lifesaver to just reach over and have access to a baby. You can also buy lifts, but our bed is pretty tall and we didn't need them.",5,1
Munchkin Auto Seat Protector,Fits perfectly in my Hyundai Car. Easy to fix and gives good support to car seat/base. Wide enough for my car seat. Has storage pocket but I am not sure if I will need it as I already have back seat organizer and diapering station to go.,5,1
Munchkin Auto Seat Protector,This is the perfect mat for my Car.  Has compartments for every toy.  Great quality and very heavy duty.  Provides good protection for my seats.,5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"This has been the nicest swing.  I also used a Graco and when the baby got tired his head slumped to the side and hit the support bar when the swing was going back and forth.  This one cradles his head beautifully (and that hair rubbing off issue that has been mentioned is something that happens to a lot of babies at 3 months or so - Jack's hair rubbed off in the crib as he moved his head and most of the rest fell out, but at maybe 5 months it grew back.  The swing didn't do it to him).  He sleeps so well in this, so I can shower or do other work.  Now that he's 21 lbs the swing motor has to work harder - the front to back swing position works better than side to side because his heavy head can slow the swinging if it's to one side.  He has grabbed the animals so many times really hard and has never broken the mechanism (you can turn the mobile off so that it is out of baby's reach).  It is true that no matter how wide you push the legs, one seems to lift a tiny bit when it swings (on hardwood floor), but I don't put it above 2 speed.  The Graco also seemed to have only a very fast swing that did not relax him, whereas this Papasan is perfect.  He loves the mirror as well.  I attach toys to the tray to give him more to play with.",5,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"This is a very nice swing.  The color of the swing matches almost any decor.  The seat is very plush, my daughter loves laying in it, and sleeps very well in it.  The mobile is adorable and the mirrored bottom of the mobile really keeps her attention.  She is four weeks old and was a month early.  She weighs about 8 pounds now and even the lowest setting on the swing is a little too strong.  I don't see much difference between the lowest setting and the stronger settings. The swing does not shut off after seven minutes only the music/mobile.  It would be convenient if this swing had a remote control so the parents could control everything with one remote. Even better would be if this swing had a plug to save on batteries.  Then it would be perfect! It is a little pricey but well worth it.  As far as the swings go this is my favorite, just has a few things that could be improved upon.  It is a little noisy swinging back and forth but that noise actually seems to sooth my daughter.  The toys on the tray could be a little more exciting but at this point my daughter is so amazed by the mirror/mobile she doesn't even use the tray.",4,1
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"We absolutely love this swing! It is by far the best purchase I have EVER made! My only complaint is that my son does not want to be held anymore! He lives in this swing!We chose this swing because of the neutral colors and the comfortable looking seat along with the side-to-side swinging. I liked having the option of side-to-side swinging or back and forth swinging. (My daughter is nine & I never felt comfortable with her swing because it would practically send her to the moon!)This swing has a slow setting that actually works with newborn! The shape, size and contour of the swing makes it PERFECT even for a newborn because their head doesn't fall forward constantly. My son will sleep in it for hours!I also like being able to change the music and sounds. It works in so many different ways that the baby is never bored. The toy bar is also wonderful!All of my friends with new babies are jealous of this swing! Everyone I know that has a baby younger than my son has choosen it (mainly off of seeing how much he loves it!) and all of my pregnant friends are getting it! I have friends & co-workers who have also purchased it for their grandchilren.This is a wonderful, durable, exciting product that is worth every penny! -Now if they only made one for adults!-",5,1
"Harmony Kids Deluxe Toy Box, Sage Dot","This toy box is well built and so soft on the outside. It goes perfectly with my 7 year old daughter's room. I would highly recommend this item, definitely worth the money.",5,1
Fisher-Price Dance Baby Dancin Band,"This toy is a big hit in my home!It was purchased for my daughter that has a rare form of dwarfism and the height was perfect for her! Also it has two volume settings which helped with her hearing issues. The toy is also very bright and lights up for any vision concerns. Overall this is a great toy for a child develomentally delayed or for those right where they should be. Even my three year old played with it regularly. Also, my children stopped the monkey countless times from spinning and it still works in perfect condition.",5,1
Roundabout Convertible Car Seat - Grey Wicker,"I am an over neurotic first time mom that doesn't even buy diapers without researching them first.  I spent countless hours on the internet researching what would be the most important purchase for my son.  After trying out the Evenflo Triumph Deluxe (highly recomended by consumer report) which isn't worth the plastic it is made from, i bought the Britax Roudabout.  I HIGHLY recomend this wonderful car seat.  It is very easy to install and my son has not complained once since we made the switch.  The cover comes off easily to wash and the straps are very easy to adjust and fit my sons body perfectly.  I had a car seat safety check officer go over my seat, and he told how happy he was to see that i had the Britax, that it was the best car seat on the market. In this case you definitely get what you pay for.  Hope this helped.",5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",I buy this so i can have my son in only one area clean and secure to play...The Best i recomend this product..My son like it to. We have labrador retriever and he like to play with my son's toys so this is perfect for us.,5,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","This play yard is great. It is light weight and easy to use. I read a lot of negative reviews about how hard it was to take the panels apart, but it was surprisingly easy. As far as the weight of this thing, my three year old can carry it to the car. It contained the younger kids perfectly and gave them lots of room to play. I would recommend this to anyone.",4,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",These are GREAT for blocking/sectioning off large areas that are too awkward or tricky to really baby proof. We are military and move a lot so I don't like to invest in a million baby proofing gates that I don't know if I'll need in 6 months. This has worked out perfectly for a certain area of our house. Definitely recommend!,4,1
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","We are using this product for our duck when we want to have him indoors. He is small and cannot fly, so this enclosure works perfectly for him. This product has worked great for us, is a nice size and easy to move. The only problem we have had is the mechanism that is used to lock/unlock the gate requires a lot of strength to operate. Other than that it is a great product for anything that you want to keep in a certain area, as long as the occupent is not strong enough to move it or climb over it. It would be especially good for many types of pets.",5,1
Summer Infant Deluxe Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen - Pink,"We purchased this monitor last October because we wanted a video monitor for when we started sleep training our daughter.  Every time we would go into check on her, our squeaky upstairs floors would wake her up, or if she was just being quiet, it would distract her for us to walk in.  This monitor is perfect since it allows us to be able to see what's going on without actually walking in her room.  Now we use it just when she is stirring around to be sure that she is just moving around rather than being upset.  The image is very clear.  We do have some interference from the home phone and our neighbors car alarm, but otherwise it works wonderful.  The only downside we have encountered is the part of the charger that plugs into the device had trouble connecting.  I called Summer Infant's customer service and they are sending out a replacement charger for free.  That makes me even more happy with going with their brand.  I definitely recommend!",5,1
Velour Boppy Nursing Pillow - green,"This was the best thing I received for my shower.  First of all, I used it immediately on myself after coming home from the hospital.  I used it to sit on to take the pressure off of my stitched area.  I could sit on the couch, in the bed and at the kitchen table without needing any medication..THANKS BOPPY!!As for my son, I use it for him to sleep on while I'm doing housework.  I prop it on the couch and lay him in the middle on his side, which adjusts to the perfect size for him.  He sleeps like a BABY!Next, I use it when I feed him.  I breastfed and went to bottles later.  It was/is perfect for both.I use it to lay him it after he eats so I can talk to him and he can explore the world.I use it sometimes when he is doing tummy time.I use it for my nieces so they can hold him without having to wear their arms down since they are only 5 and 7.I have several more, but those are the main points.  I would buy it over and over again if anything ever happened to my Boppy.Also, I wash the slip cover many times, and it is standing strong.  I have only had to wash the pillow a few times, but it still looks brand new.BOPPY GETS MY ""CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT"" VOTE...A+++++++++++++***UPDATE...It also helped with my son sitting up.  I would place it around him so he wouldn't get hurt if he would fall over.  It keeps going and going and going...",5,1
Couture Bundle Me in Mocha Suede,"I registered for this item and received it as a shower gift.  My son was born in January and I have used it everyday since he was born.  It fits snugly around him and does not interfere with the car seat harness.  I was given two snow suits for him to wear and I never used them in the car seat because everything I read advised that you should not put your child in a car seat with bulky clothing because it makes it impossible to get a good tight fit.  It fits perfectly in the car seat and cushions him all around.  Because it zippers around him from the bottom he doesn't lose his shoes or socks etc.  It washes like a dream and looks as good now as it did when I got it.  Now that the weather is nicer, during the day I put him in it without the top piece zippered on and in the evening, when it is cooler, I zip the top piece back on and he stays warm and toasty.  I couldn't recommend this product any more highly!  I tell everyone about it!",5,1
"Badger Basket Elegance Round Baby Bassinet, White with Ecru Waffle",Bought this as a gift. Different than a regular bassinet. Easy to assemble. Has a nice storage area underneath. Perfect for a princess.,5,1
"Badger Basket Elegance Round Baby Bassinet, White with Ecru Waffle",I bought this for my daughter and it is really pretty.  Looks just like the pictures.  It's the perfect little &#34;princess&#34; bassinet.,5,1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"I was having a hard time getting my 2 1/2 year old son to sit at the table for ANY meal.  So I thought a booster would be the ticket.....I was right!!  And the Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat was the perfect choice!  It gives him the lift he needs to feel part of the family, and the security and comfort to stay seated with us, even if he's finished his meal.  The orange is also a great compliment with the earthy decor in our house!!  I looked at a lot of these and kept coming back to this one.  Wipes easily, just perfect!!",5,1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,My kids love this booster! It's very comfy. I would definitely recommend to others. Great products for kids. Easy to clean.Love it! Cute color. Perfect for the kids. Very portable. Great product. Very safe stays put on the chair doesn't slide off. Love it love it love it!,5,1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"Exactly as the description says as well as the other reviews. Extremely happy with my purchase and will order another for my next child. The green color is good since I know other products had problems with their colors and it is exactly like the picture. Soft, light and my daughter uses it as a play seat and fits perfectly at the table. Nice and small with just the right height.",5,1
"Stork Craft Beatrice Armoire Chest, Cherry","My husband and I are very happy with this armoire!  We have a small apartment with little storage space and this armoir is the perfect size providing loads of extra storage.  I read other reviews so I knew it didn't have a hanging bar, but I knew I wasn't going to be hanging clothes.  One thing I didn't expect was that it was white inside, but it makes it easier to see.  We had it put together within an hour, instructions were easy to follow.  A solid piece of furniture well worth $240.Jessica,NY",5,1
"Stork Craft Beatrice Combo Tower Chest, White",I bought this piece hoping it would work with the crib that we bought that didn't have a dresser with it.  I was so happy to see that the finishes were perfect together and it looks beautiful.  I was nervous from reading some of the reviews that it would come damaged and not in good shape.  When my husband and I opened the box everything was there and nothing was damaged.  It took us about and hour and half to put it together and was very easy to following the directions.  I LOVE IT and would recommend this item to everyone.,5,1
"Stork Craft Beatrice Combo Tower Chest, White",Product was delievered in perfect condition with all pieces.  The only issue we had was the door on the tower didn't seem to align well at first but now it opens and closes easily after using it several times. It looks beautiful. Great price! I would recommend to a friend.,5,1
Comfort U Pillow -For Total Body Support,"I had a bi-level lumbar fusion at the beginning of January 2014 (happy new year!) and I ordered this from my hospital room more or less on a whim.  I knew I was going to have issues with getting comfortable in bed plus my wife and I compete for the other body pillow we have, so I ordered this and a navy blue cover.  I could not be more pleased.  The pillow can be shaped however you want it, which was ultimately exactly what I needed it to do.  I had to sleep flat on my back for a few weeks so I would get nestled into this beast and pull the ends together under my legs.  Perfectly comfortable.  Now that I am somewhat recovered, it still manipulate it all around to get support exactly where I need it.Awesome pillow!",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I have to say right of the bat, this is the comfiest pillow ever! It is nice and firm and stays put. It has really helped with side sleeping which is insanely painful for me. Actually its so comfy 3 year old son (who fits exactly inside the pillow) keep trying to steal it from me. As does my husband! Honestly, I can't say enough good things about this pillow!!! I am actually able to sleep almost entirely free of pain because of this! And even with me cuddled up with this, it still only takes up half the queen size bed. My husband complains about how little space he has, but he does that even when it's not on the bed so I ignore him. The only thing I hate about this thing (yes hate!) is that the pillowcase is a complete pain in the butt to put back on once you have washed it! If they made it with a zipper instead of a regular style case this would be perfect. Oh,the seam along the curve of the U is kinda painful on your neck and shoulders when you use it next to your head instead of at you feet but bunching a sheet or regular pillowcase along it completely solves that problem.  For me as I have at least a dozen pillowcases this is no big deal. But it might be for others.  It's still so amazing that even these flaws don't deserve to knock down the rating. I am so glad I bit the bullet on this and got it. We almost didn't due to it being $40 for a pillow but it is way worth the cost even if your on a tight budget. As an extra note, I was previously sleeping on my side bundled up in about 6-8 crappy Walmart pillows that went everywhere, never held their shape and that are NOT much help. My main problems were due to pain in my knees, hips, and shoulders and now it's almost 100% pain free! Normally I sleep on either my stomach or my back, so this is also invaluable at keeping me on my side.",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I was hesitant to spend so much on a pillow but this is one of the best purchases I've ever made.  It is so comfy it's unbelievable.  I started using it when I was four months pregnant and I began to have some back pain and needed support.  Now it is two months later and I can not bear the thought of sleeping without this pillow!  It's true that it is difficult to get in and out of but an easy fix as suggested by another reviewer is to lift the side up and get out rather than trying to climb out over it.  Unlike some other reviewers, the size seems to fit perfectly for me, I am 5'4"".  I highly recommend it.  Money well spent.",5,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I never got around to buying a pregnancy pillow with my first pregnancy but since I'm already having a hard time getting comfortable in bed this time, I figured I'd go with the big guns.  So I have nothing to compare to and while it's not perfect, it sure beats using multiple pillows and having to rearrange all of them every time I roll from one side to the other.  I don't at all find the seam to be a problem, something a lot of other reviews point out.  I do, however, find having to keep your bottom arm under the pillow a bit awkward at times.  I'm not sure what the perfect design would be and may try this with the opening at top, using a regular pillow for my head so I have more freedom for my arms (with space between the pillow I use for my head and the one I use for my belly, etc.), but that is my only piece of negative feedback so far.  I love having both belly and back support - this keeps me from rolling onto my back and I think I've woken up less since it's so much easier to roll from one side to the other, again, without having to rearrange a bunch of pillows. Also, I have a queen bed and this takes up just about half, so my husband has plenty of room.  It would work better with a king and I definitely wouldn't get it if you have a full/double, but a queen is definitely doable.  If you want belly and back support in one, this seems like just about the best all-in-one option out there.",4,1
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","Love this item,,pregnant or not! Perfect for back support or just to snuggle with. Very Comfortable. Need to purchase a cover",5,1
Paper Dolls Pillow,First the set is not being taken off the shelves and replacds with Blossoms.  It is NOT on the list of discontinued bedding patterns at BRU.  I got that straight fromteh manager who called corporate to make sure.  They have just brought in more items to coordinate with this line so it's not going anyway.This was one of those final touches that we weren't sure if we wanted to spend the money on but I'm glad we did!  I kept it in the closet until we converted our crib into the toddler bed.  I dug it out of the closet to use as a toss pillow on her daybed nad it really is a nice touch.  It makes her bed look not so plain now and it's teh perfect size for her to play with.  So it was a good purchase and great finishing touch to a wonderful pattern.,5,1
Evenflo Whisper Connect Sensa Monitor,"My husband and I originally wanted a video monitor, but decided to go with this monitor since our son's room was only next door.  This monitor is perfect. We hear EVERYTHING, from his breathing to the kids outside playing.  I love this monitor.  I'm giving it 4stars because the alarms goes off on it's own sometimes.  My son is 6 1/2 months and it's gone off only about 3-4 times, but it was very annoying when it did...especially in the middle of the night.  Otherwise, it's perfect and I'm glad we registered for it.",4,1
Haba Salto Rattle,"When I first received this toy, I was a little disappointed at how small it was, but it is the perfect size for tiny little hands. When we first gave it to her, she would just grab onto it and wave it around, then as she got older, she would hold it with one hand and focus on turning the rainbow beads in the center. She also uses it as a wooden teething ring, and still enjoys banging it around, tambourine-style. Well-made, solid toy that will certainly still be around for a younger sibling.",5,1
North States Supergate Extra Wide Wire Mesh Gate,"This gate is perfect! I have a wider hallway and none of the other pet/kids gates would work. Once I figured out the &#34;just right&#34; measurement on the grooves, I marked it with a sharpie so it would be easy to put into place every time.My dog doesn't push, lean or try anything with the gates, but this does keep good tension when up.I would suggest this pet gate.",5,1
North States Industries Supergate Extra Wide Swing Gate,i have two small dogs that i was trying to keep out of my living room until i got home in case one of them had an accident. This is hte perfect width and height for both of them.,5,1
North States Industries Supergate Extra Wide Swing Gate,I am so glad I didn't pay a lot of attention to the negative feedback of this product.  It is everything and more.  I have 2 dogs and 5 cats.  The cats use this as a spring board and the dogs jump on it and yet it holds up perfectly.  I am tempted to get another one for the front of the house.  This product is much better priced than the others.  Extremely happy.  Thank you,5,1
Blossoms - Wall Border,"I LOVE this item! It was the perfect touch to our nursery, we painted the bottom a dark pink and the top a shade lighter, with the boarder in the middle, it was perfect. The wallpaper was so easy to hang, it went up without any problems, I would definatlly recomend you buy this for a finishing touch!!",5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,This soft but impermeable bib is perfect for protecting baby's clothes from the exceses of learning to eat like a human being. It is soft but im-permeable and completely washable. The &#34;well&#34; in front catches spilled liquids of all kinds. A ingenius design.,5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,My boy has been wearing this since 6 months and it has been the perfect bib.  It's easy to clean and it catches all of his spilled food and drink.  My only complaint is now I have a ton of conventional bibs that I have no use for!,5,1
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,They are perfect for the mess that involves feeding an infant / toddler. They are easy to clean and are great looking,5,1
Dermo-Cleansing 500ml. (16.90 FL OZ),"Us moms want the best for our little ones and that doesn&#8217;t stop at how we keep our baby clean. Mustela Bebe Dermo-Cleansing is a cleansing gel for hair and body that is soap-free and does not sting babies eyes. It softens skin and helps soothe irritation with its formula containing vitamin B5.This is a hypoallergenic cleanser which minimizes the risk of allergic reactions (which is something I love) and compensates for the drying effect of hard water with its super-fatted agents (coconut derivatives). Mmmm coconut!This is a gel texture although the lathering is perfect. It&#8217;s not to thin where it looks like you haven&#8217;t put any soap on the baby yet it&#8217;s not too foamy. It&#8217;s the perfect &#8220;in between&#8221;.It&#8217;s easy to use! Put a bit in the palm of your hands, lather babies hair and body, rinse and dry baby off. I do like the smell of this. It reminds me of when I was younger, at the beach with all the smells of everyone wearing sunscreen.This product can be used from birth, onwards. The value for a 750ml bottle is approximately $22.00 USD.",4,1
EvenFlo SmartSteps Exersaucer Entertainer,I absolutely love this saucer.  I looked at so many of them before I finally decided on this one and I am so glad that I did a comparison.  No other saucers holds a candle to this one. It folds up so that I can easily stick in the trunk and take it where ever I go and clean up is a breeze! My 6 months old loves to sit and play in the saucer and we have the most fun watching him explore and get all excited over all the toys that are there.  It's like a small playground for him. I would never recommend any other Exersaucer. Smartsteps Entertainer is perfect!,5,1
Kolcraft Cuddle n' Care Bassinet,This thing was easy for me to put together while alone with the baby and I don't think I used any tools.  It works really well and seems to be really well thought out.  There are little wheels at the bottom that will pop inside to make it into a rocker.  There's a mesh basket at the bottom for storage.  It takes regular bassinet sheets.  I bought a 2-pack of another brand and it works perfect.  Everything is washable too.,5,1
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"Bought this for our 5 month old and he's still loving it at 7 months.  It is the way that I get to cook dinner, so I love it too!  However, it's not perfect.  FYI, the assembly instructions could be a bit better.  It's hard to figure out how to assemble the little stands that stablize the bottom saucer.  I had to call the manufacturer for help.  The holes dont match up but I learned that's because Graco, the manufacturer, uses the same saucer on several different toys so the holes are actually for a different application.  The same little stands (or legs) don't stay clicked into place, so I've given up and we let the saucer just rock.  I did ask Graco to send another set, which they said they would do.  We're waiting for those to arrive.  In addition, our boy loves the puppet, but it's not the easiest to operate.  The hole in the back just doesnt seem to be angled right and it's hard to make your fingers fit to properly move the mouth. I'd have given it 5 stars if I didnt have to spend so much time futzing with the stands and calling the manufacturer.",4,1
Mini Co-Sleeper,"I really like the size of this co-sleeper. It's perfect for having baby in our master bedroom without taking up a ton of room like a full-sized crib would do.  Seems very stable and durable and should work until baby is about 6 months old and ready to move to her own room.  Only complaint would be the leg extensions, which I needed because my bed is higher than average.  They seem a little shaky and I worry about breaking them off when I have to move the sleeper.",4,1
Dex Products Safe Sleeper Bed Rail Ultra,"Although the safety strap is a bit difficult to figure out how to tighten, the ""legs"" that go between the mattress and box spring do a fine job of holding it in place even when our 35 lb toddler is wedged up against it.  Love that it folds down almost all the way-another inch and it would.  This works perfectly and gives about a foot of room of open space at the head and about 18 in by the foot(where the step stool goes) on a full size ""big kid"" bed.",4,1
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","I love this, I bought this for my daughter and her new little one and it has turned out to be so handy. It's perfect.",5,1
Heininger  1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"I'm one of those people who is always aggravated by seat belts, whether my own or being in someone else's vehicle. I usually use a quilted wrap to keep from rubbing my skin near my neck, but it shifts or the closure ends up irritating my skin.Heininger's Automotive CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster has given me the near perfect relief. It took me two tries to get it attached correctly. The first time I put it in backwards. While it still worked fine, it caused my belts to twist and tangle incorrectly. I had to remove the clamp which was a real pest to detach. Once so, I flipped it around and got it attached correctly.Once in place, I was very happy with relief it provided. My seat belt no longer rides high on my collarbone. Nice! Using it the next time I climbed in the car showed how effortless it is to reclip the seat belt and keep the belt off my collarbone. Only then, at first, I didn't like how I can feel the plastic adjuster against my hips. I quickly forgot about as I started to drive.One thing I noticed the second time around is that you can't keep the strap adjuster more than just a few inches away from the buckle, otherwise the seat belt straps where they're clipped at begin to ride high and lay against your midsection rather than low at your hips. The instructions do state not to use the adjuster more than just a few scant inches away from the seat belt buckle - now I know why. The seat belts will raise up and away from your lap if you do.Pros:- Provides the relief needed from seat belts riding high.- Easy to install (once you figure out the short installation instructions).- You get two of them.Cons:- Rides high if the adjuster slides too far away from the buckle.- The bulkiness of the belt can be felt and may be a tad uncomfortable for some people.Overall, I'm happy with Heininger Commutemate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster. It's given me the relief I needed to drive comfortably, especially with longer distances.",4,1
JJ Cole Essentials Sling Style Backpack Diaper Bag Black Grey,We originally ordered this bag so that my husband wouldn't feel like he was using a purse for a diaper bag.  I fell in love with it too. It is hands free and there is a place for my wallet and cell phone.  This bag is perfect for short trips or a meal out.  All the separate compartments really keep you organized.  The only problem we had was the stitching on the outer flap of the diaper compartment was too close to the edge and the material starting fraying and essentially falling apart.  I loved the bag so much that I thought I would give it another try and have not had any problems with the new one.  I am hoping that it was just a fluke.  I prefer this bag over my other 2 diaper bags HANDS DOWN.,4,1
JEEP Twin All Weather Umbrella Stroller: Yellow &amp; Black,"I have owned an expensive tamdem stroller and it was too big. I didn't like the fact that I couldn't see both of my children. It wasn't compact and didn't fit in my van either.This stoller is perfect.  It's light weight, easy to assemble and use.  Also, I am able to see both of my children at the same time! You can't beat the price either.  I am very happy with this stroller!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","If you are looking for that perfect baby gift-look no further this is it.  This is the one item I didn't receive during all the baby showers and gifts I received while waiting for our newest addition.  I never thought at my age that I would have a little one in my house again as my other children are now grown.  Of all the swings, seats and play mats, this is the seat that my now 4 month old loves.  He sits in it for very long periods at a time, completely at ease and entertained with the vibration on.  Day-care also has these seats and they have told me that he loves it.  The colors are bright and eye catching, the toys are placed where they can easily be seen and grabbed at when he reaches that stage.Assembly was very easy.  All that is needed is a Philips head screw driver and a little time.  Instructions are easy to follow but I didn't need them.  There are just a few parts to put together and you can see from the picture on the box where each piece goes.  The cover is easy to put on and remove in order to clean.  The batteries are under the cover, closed with a screw to keep little fingers and mouths out of danger.  It keeps him happy and entertained while I am working around the house and that makes me happy.  I would rate it more than 5 stars if allowed.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","This seat has been sooooo perfect! It reclines enough so my newborn can be comfortable (she actually uses it to sleep in a lot of the time.) It's big enough for my two year old also. I like that it rocks easily, but can also stay stationary. It's bright and colorful! The only thing I dont really like is where the toy bar is.I feel like my daughter is going to get hit in the head by the toys (but she never does.) I would definitely recommend this seat!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",This seat is awesome.  My daughter had the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders one (it was left over from my son) and she hated it.  She couldn't reach any of the toys.  In this seat she's more upright and can kick to rock & can also grab the toy in the middle that sings.  She loves to watch the butterflies ""dance"" when she makes the chair rock and the vibrations are perfect.,5,1
Tiny Love Clip and Go Musical Mobile,"I love this.  It has a clip to hang it from a stroller, but for my car seat I just removed the large orange clip and it is the perfect height.  I use the lithium batteries and they seem to last the best.",5,1
Fitted Pack N Play Sheet in Traditional Blue Print,"I am impressed with these sheets, they fit my graco pack n play perfect, they are very soft, and they are just thick enough that you can not see the print of my pack n play mattress through them.",5,1
Fitted Pack N Play Sheet in Traditional Blue Print,"I really love this product, sooooo soft, great quality, a must for your playard. I have the Chicco Rattatania (Lullaby Magic) and it works perfectly.",5,1
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,I purchased this crib sheet for the Dream On Me 3"" Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress.  It fits perfectly and is still soft for my 7 month old.,5,1
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"After reading all of the product reviews, I decided to give this a try. So far, he so good. The sheets shrank to the perfect size for the 6&#34; mini crib mattress after one wash. We'll see how to holds up after multiple washes.",5,1
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,this is just so SOFT... it is perfect! I admired their softness for 5 minutes once i got them.. couldn't believe how great this material is!!,5,1
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,This is the only sheet I have found that fits my traditional DaVinci Crescent Mini Crib 50 coil mattress.It's thin but fits perfectly. I highly recommend buying a few.,4,1
Chocolate Brown &quot;love&quot; Duffle Tote,"My son just turned one, and yes, I am now only experiencing the great joy of ""the perfect bag""! I had been using the black bag the hospital gave us when leaving the hospital. It served its purpose, but I definitely felt the need to get a new, more spacious (and of course, stylish) bag. I searched high and low, only to find those falling into the boring or overpriced category. Then one day when picking up a few things at Babies R Us, I happened upon this bag and stopped dead in my tracks. I LOVED it!! But, admittedly, when seeing the price, I waivered on it. Should I or shouldn't I? I must have held it for 15 minutes... and with a shrug of my shoulders, put it back. ""I'll think about it"", I said. Months passed and after even more unsuccessful searches, I decided, ""that's it, I'm buying it!"".  Very excited, with credit card in hand, I jumped online only to find that this bag was SOLD OUT everywhere and that there was a waiting list the size of I don't even know what. I couldn't believe it! Again, I would have to wait...My sister was shopping at Babies R Us the other day, saw it, called me, and within minutes I was there, in line and out the door... with my beautiful new bag! It's been about 2 weeks that I have been using it and I AM IN LOVE!!!Do not hesitate! The price my seem high at first, but really, it's a beautifuly, incredibly function, high quality bag. It holds all the necessities - for the both of us. I am no longer juggling multiple bags - a diaper bag for him and a purse for myself. Initially I was concerned that there was not a shoulder strap option, but it's not an issue. It fits so comfortably over my shoulder and nestles right under my arm... it doesn't slide - at all! And, most of all, this bag is all glam... it's gorgeous, feminine... a real looker! You've got to get it :)One final word if you're on the fence. If you hate heavy bags, this is probably not the one for you. When filled to capacity, it does get a bit heavy, BUT (yes, there is a but) it's nothing you can't handle. I still give this bag 5-Stars... it's amazing!!!!Alas, my search is over... thank you Wendy!!!",5,1
Koko - 6Pc. Bedding Set,"Very feminime and soft NOT overly bright and tacky. I love this collection, it is perfect for our sweet little girl. The butterfly and vine accents/ print our so serene and tastful. I'm a very happy mommy and even daddy loves it!",5,1
Boppy Pregnancy Wedge with Cotton Slipcover,"This pregnancy wedge is probably the best purchase I've made thus far in terms of keeping myself comfortable (and happy) during my pregnancy.  Unfortunately, I made the decision to purchase one way too late.  I only got mine last week when I was 36 weeks pregnant(!!), but if I had bought one sooner, I would have saved myself many sleepless, uncomfortable nights and naps.Like other people, I had been skeptical about buying an $18 wedge for my pregnant belly when I already had a body pillow and several other pillows to provide support.  It didn't seem practical, but as the weeks wore on during my third trimester, it became abundantly clear that pillows either don't give enough support and faltered beneath the weight of my belly, or were too firm and lifted my tummy uncomfortably to the point where it seemed that my baby was being smashed back on to me.This Boppy wedge provides the perfect amount of support, and adjusting it is simply a matter of bringing it further or closer to you.  Another great thing about it is that it is not overly large, so it isn't cumbersome to sleep with.  I completely forget that it's there after I've gotten myself comfortable with it!  In addition, it doesn't absorb your body heat like other pillows do, so it never gets uncomfortably warm.Finally, you might wondering what you're going to do with it after you give birth to your baby.  Well, the pillow can be used as a back support or a wedge to place between your knees while you're sleeping to preserve hip alignment.  And if you don't want to use it for these other things, then just keep it in storage for your next pregnancy!I'm actually so incredibly sold on this product that I plan on purchasing them for other first-time pregnant women as baby shower gifts.This is a good investment for your and your baby's comfort, and your sanity as well!",5,1
The First Years Disney Pooh Soft Potty Seat,My son loves this versus the little individual potty he sits on. It makes potty time more real to him because he gets to sit on the toilet like a big boy! It fits perfectly on the seat.,5,1
The First Years Disney Pooh Soft Potty Seat,"My 24 month old daughter loves this potty seat.  I bought it for her last month, and as soon as she saw it, she wanted to start using it right away!  She now goes pee-pee on it everyday (we're still working on poo-poo).  The only negative to this potty seat is that it's not made for elongated seats, which we have in both of our bathrooms, so it tends to slide alittle (it doesn't seem to bother my daughter, though).  I wish that would have been stated in the product description because I probably wouldn't have purchased it had I known it wasn't going to be a perfect fit.  I would have returned it and exchanged it for a different one that's made for elongated seats if my daughter didn't love it so much.",4,1
Peg Perego Aria Twin MT Stroller 2005,"I don't think there is a ""perfect"" double stroller out there for $300.  There are single strollers that cost way more than this one and those are not perfect either.  So I'm giving it 4 stars because it can be improved by the maker.  The child trays are small.  The sun shades are small.  But I have one of those single canopy sunshade and it works great with this stroller since it's not too wide.  The stickers for the word ""Aria"" were coming off but I put it back and it seemed to stay.  Other than that, the size is perfect.  My 2 year old and 6 months old daughters are very happy riding in this stroller.  Some peoople said the weight differences could throw it off balance and might cause it hard to turn or move around. But I don't find that is a problem.  It's light and very easy to move around.  Both trays does swing open individually from the middle out.  It has separate seat reclining which is perfect.  The closing and opening are very easy to use. I have a Prius and this stroller does fit in the trunk.  Overall, this is a great tandem stroller.  My girls prefer sitting next to each other rather than one sits in the front and the other sits in the back.  As for the price differences because of the colors, I don't understant that at all.  I prefer the black one and it's cheaper.",4,1
"Dexbaby Safe Lift Universal Crib Wedge, White","I like this universal crib wedge - I use it when my son gets a cold, since he's too young yet for a pillow but could use some propping up when his nose is plugged.  I find that it's easier to actually put the wedge under the mattress instead of under the sheet - it stays put better and I don't have to worry about my son feeling the zipper on it.  The wedge stays in place nicely and is the perfect width for our standard-sized crib.  So much easier to use than trying to prop the mattress at an angle with books!",4,1
Trendsport Lite Stroller,"Yes, there are some faults with the stroller, but based on the price, it is still probably the best bang for the buck.  We got this stroller because I needed something that I can carry up and down the stairs while I am on the subway.  Most people in NYC are helpful, but every once in a while, I have to do it myself.  I would not know how I would do it without my Trendsport.My husband bought the Graco MetroLite, which was 18 lbs, so I complained that I needed something lighter.  The Trendsport was perfect, since we did not have to shell out a lot of money.  Sure, there are some problems trying to steer it, and there are only 2 seat-positions, but these are very minor drawbacks.  It is still a great stroller and definitely a great bargain.",4,1
Sir Leapsalot 5 Piece Crib Set,I had a difficult time trying to find a nursery theme for my boy/girl twins until I found the Wendy Bellissimo set at Babies R US.  This past weekend I put the whole set together in their nursery and it looks BEAUTIFUL! The colors are just perfect for either a boy/girl nursery and the froggies are adorable.  5 stars to Wendy Bellissimo!,5,1
"Kalencom On the Go Potty, Blue",I bought this for my little girl who was potty training and we were going on a trip to North Dakota.  It was wonderful!  I highly recommend this product.  She felt comfortable sitting on it and it comes with it's on bag and we just keep it in the van.  Perfect!,5,1
KidCo Finger Guard - Gray - 2 Pk,This product is just what I was looking for. They are very durable and easy to take on and off. My daughter's door tends to slam shut and lock with the windows open. This is a perfect solution! During the day I put it on the inner hinge side and it keeps it open. At night I put it on the knob side and close the door almost all the way but know it won't shut. I recommend this product and plan to buy another pair for our double doors in the den.,5,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Formula Dispenser/Snack Cup,We just spent a few days at Disneyland and this container was great for bringing snacks with us.  We were able to use the divider and put 2 different kinds of puffs + 1 kind of yogurt drops.  Worked perfectly.  Lid stays on.  Sturdy (our little guy threw it multiple times). Great container!  Could also be used for just 1 kind of puffs.  Fill it up!,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Reservoirs Replacement, 2 Pack",I ordered these because my dishwasher tends to mangle bottle pieces on occasion. This was a great value (especially through Amazon Mom). They fit perfectly with both my old and new Dr. Brown bottles.,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack",Perfect for cleaning bottles or straws. stiff enough to get the job done yet flexible to move around the product,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","These little brushes are fantastic! We used them for the Dr. Brown's bottles and then kept on using them for sippy cups and especially the straws for straw cups. They fit inside perfectly and clean out all the gunk in case you forget to rinse them immediately. They hold up pretty well, too. We have only just started using  a second one and the first one lasted for at least 8 months. We always propped it up with the cleaning part at the top in a little cup so it would dry completely, and we washed it regularly with soap and water. I think these are a little smaller than some of the other cleaning brushes, so you do need them for the Dr. Brown bottles (The bottles come with a couple, so don't buy these until you need more).",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","I was looking for a perfect brush for cleaning the straws of the water bottles, straw cups of my toddler. Finally I found one. They are just perfect and appropriately priced.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Storage Travel Caps Replacement, 3 Pack",These are perfect. Seals the Dr. Browns bottles tight so that there's no leakage. Great for travel or storing expressed milk.,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Storage Travel Caps Replacement, 3 Pack",I didn't like using the caps with the rings because they always leaked.  These fit perfectly on my glass Evenflo bottles.,5,1
"Playtex Nurser With Drop-Ins Liner, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary, 3-Count","I have tried so many bottles. Really, Avent, Soothie, Mam, Ventaire, Dr. Browns, Gerber, Evenflo, and Born Free: from the cheapest to some of the most expensive.These are not perfect but they are what worked the best.Pros:-wide nipple, baby preferred-cleaned easily-had few parts-could be warmed in a bottle warmer or hot water-didn't need special tricks to keep from leakingCons:-had to buy liners-measurements could be betterI got over buying the liners in two ways: I started recycling my liners and I started using the Playtex flat liners available here on Amazon which helped the cost a lot. I can buy 5 months supple of liners (5 bottles a day) for less than $30 shipped/taxed.The measurements are still not great but since I premix every day's formula in a large pitcher the night before, I don't have to have the exact measurements. I know now from practice at about where on the liners the milk needs to go.",4,1
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),"So, I have a 4 day old daughter, and due to medical reasons, we have to supplement with formula. We have triedTommee Tippee Closer to Nature Newborn Starter Set, but their ""slow flow"" nipples flow at the speed of Niagara falls compared to how these flow. These work a million times better as the flow actually works at the speed my daughter needs. Other ones would cause milk to spill out the side of her mouth, and allows her to take so quickly she projectile spits up because her little stomach can't handle it.Anyways, these are perfect for my newborn, not sure how she will grow with them, but she will definitely be using these for the meantime.",5,1
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),"This is a really nice and handy little set of bottles.  I love the size, it is perfect for a newborn to 6 month old baby, and even can be used later for juice or water.  The design of these bottles is amazing and I love that it cuts down on gas for the baby.  And of course BPA free is a must.  This would make a lovely baby shower gift as well because what new mom couldn't use extra bottles?",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"This swing was great.  When my boy was a newborn, he loved the wave sounds and rain water.  As he got older, he preferred the music.  We used the cradle swing initially and switched to the forward/backward swing as he got older (> 6 months).  He has recenty outgrown it but we plan to keep it for our next child.  He LOVED the lights and mobile as well.Only complaint was that the batteries wore out fast and the swing never sat perfect level (always seemed lean slightly to one side).",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"This swing was a lifesaver for our household!The swing can be turned to rock forward & back,or side to side; so if the baby gets restless,you can offer them a completly different view with the push of a button.The little globe on top changes color as it turns,which proved to be facinating to my son.My son was born with severe acid reflux,and was unable to lay completly flat,especially after eating,so this swing also served as a cradle/bassinet for the first few months of his life.We both slept much sounder due to the aqurium swing and the soothing water sounds it makes(as sound as you can sleep with a newborn.)Although there is a slight mechanical sound as well,its not too bad.Last,I do recall that when we first got home,the swing seemed to go a little fast for an infant-we simply layed a rolled up recieving blanket over the blue swinging arm to weigh it down a bit,and it was perfect!",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"My husband bought this pump for me so I could sustain my milk while we were traveling. I was afraid I would dry up while being away from our baby. This pump is awesome! Great for traveling: relatively small, easy to put together and take apart, easy to clean and easy to use.I made the mistake the first couple of times of pumping constantly which was a bit taxing on my hand and wrist. Then I figured out you don't have to do all that and that once your milk comes in, you can just have one continuous pump which extracts quite a bit of milk before you have to make the pumping motion again (if you're not sure what I mean, just read the directions and you'll get it.) It will save your hand and wrist a lot of trouble!I strongly recommend this for moms that aren't able to use an electric pump. I have both but when I'm on the go, this pump is perfect.",5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,Really easy to use!  Perfect to take when traveling! Serves its purpose one breast at a time. It's a great product.,5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,very nice mannual pump worked great. i love the fact that Dr. Brown's bottles can attach to the pump perfectly. i'm using it every day and it's powerful. it doesn't need too much of space as the electronic pump.,5,1
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"This is a fantastic manual pump, especially for the price! I have the Ameda Purely Yours and I actually find myself using this more now. I do still love my Ameda, but this is so quick & easy to use and clean. Believe it or not, I can actually get more milk in less time than with my dual electric. It's perfect for my middle of the night pumping session and travels easily. I can't recommend this enough. I might even buy one more to have an extra for travel etc. Great product!",5,1
Britax Marathon in Ashley Floral,"I just purchased a marathon for my 4 month old son who is just too heavy for his snugride. I got this seat a couple of days ago and could not believe how quick and easy it was to install. I was a little worried it would be too big rear-facing, we have an X-Terra, but it fit perfectly behind the drivers seat and I didn't even have to move the seat forward to make it fit. My 2 year old daughter has the Eddie Bauer 3-in-1 Elite and it was a total nightmare to install rear-facing and would only fit in the middle seating position. I wish I had never bought it for that and many other reasons! I just ordered the Ashley Floral pattern for my daughter and can't wait to use it. For the safety, ease of install, and total convenience, you can't beat the value of Britax.",5,1
Britax Marathon in Ashley Floral,"We bought this car seat after originally buying a Graco that was later recalled. Although it was pricey it's been worth every dime. My son is three years old now and is tall for his age but he still fits perfectly into this seat. It's easy to clean and is a breeze to install. In fact, if you have the LATCH system this car seat takes less than a minute to install. We bought the Britax Companion for our new little one because it was the safest one on the market at the time but at 6 months old it's already too small for her! We're going to get another Marathon for her and will install it rear-facing for now and after she's 20lbs/1yr old will turn around.",5,1
"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White","This is exactly what i was looking for. After reading all the reviews I almost didn't buy it, but in the end I knew it was the one. It does take a few hours to assemble but if you take your time, make sure all the parts are there, and use the instructions (all things we normally don't do when putting together furniture but after reading the reviews, we did on this one) it will turn out perfect.",5,1
"Babe Ease Original Clean Shopper, Blue Zoo","I have been using this product for at least 6 months. I have been very pleased with it. I find that it DOES fit in the Costco cart. The side flaps JUST fit over the sides, but the side flaps aren't as secure in the Costco cart. However, because my year-old daughter is not much of a squirmer in the cart it doesn't pull away from the sides for me. I have been very pleased with this product and for the price, I would buy it again if needed.  I also purchased an over-the-seat leather trash bag holder for my car and this fits perfectly inside it, so we always have it when we get to the store. My cart cover has also been washed multiple times and holds up well.",5,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Small, Yellow","Our little 2 month old has been swaddled up nightly in these blankets since we discovered them.  We were swaddling her the old-fashioned way in blankets until I found these.  These are easy easy easy!  Also work great in warm weather, seems like the perfect amount of warmth for her, without her getting overheated even on warm nights. She loves these blankets-- they calm her right now even at her fussiest moments!",5,1
Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat - Collegiate Pattern: Jefferson Tan,"My daughter loves this seat - plain and simple. It's easy to install securely in almost any vehicle, and getting her in an out is a breeze.  We love the design and ease of use - long straps with plenty of slack and the buckle pad around the leg area (lower buckles) that protect the baby from getting pinched or uncomfortable from the tight straps.This is a perfect buy for us that I'd recommend to anyone looking to upgrade from a baby/infant seat.  She certainly loves resting in it or taking in all the sights as we drive along.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Multi-Purpose Toy Hammock,"it is pretty cool and in perfect new condition however I really thought it was going to be bigger than I thought I must of review the ad wrong, but it doesn't hold that many toys",4,1
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,Great Product ! Great Quality! Very east to install and it fits perfect in my Daughters room. Thanks U Guys,5,1
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"Although I was apprehensive, this was a perfect fit for all of the stuffed and furry items in my kids bedroom.  Although not toddlers any more, my pre-teen has this above the buckbed in the corner.  Can't easily be reached by the dog (that's really important as the dog gets 'confused' as to which is a doggie toy and which isn't), but once up in the bed, all is accessible.  Easy to install too.great price for something which works so well.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,This was just what I needed to get all of my kids stuffed toys corraled.  It works perfectly & was easy to put up.,4,1
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"Its perfect for my daughters small bedroom, it holds all of stuffed animals! Keeps them all off of the floor, so much more organized!",5,1

Baby Safe Feeder 2 Feeders &amp; 2 Bags Starter Kit,"These feeders are so handy. The handles are perfect for little hands and they hold cookies, apple and orange slices nicely! A great idea for my baby who watches her sister eat snacks and can now have her own! I've also put ice in there to help soothe her gums when she's teething.",5,1
Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Newborn Feeding Set,"I am a breastfeeding mom and I had a hard time to get either one of my daughters to take a bottle. I tried EVERY bottle out there, and Dr. Brown's bottles seem to be the ONLY bottles my daughters would accept. This may be due to the fact that Dr. Brown's nipples do not collapse when the babies suck, the nipple is perfect shape and size, the flow is consistent and the unique design eliminates the air bubbles, so there's definitely less gas than we experienced while trying other bottles.I took away one of the stars because of the minor problems we had with this set: these bottles require more time and effort to clean, they leak occasionally [no, I didn't fill them above the line and no, I did not overtighten them - have no idea why they leaked], the larger bottles do not fit in most of the insulated bottle totes that come with diaper bags or sold exclusively for baby bottles [and that was a little bit of a problem for us, because we only use bottles when going places, but we solved it by using a larger/taller insulated lunch bag from Ikea store] and the 4-oz bottles that come in this set will be outgrown pretty quickly. My younger daughter is 7 weeks old and she eats 4 oz per feeding and looks like she could eat more if only the bottle would hold more...I would recommend getting a set of 3 9-oz Dr. Brown's bottles as it looks like a better value and will serve you longer (you can pour as little milk or formula in a 9 oz bottle as you need, while 4 oz bottles will only hold 4 oz max, and will be useless in a couple of months at the latest).",4,1
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","This is a perfect fit for all changing dressers, soft under baby's body, is well made, cleans up easy and last.",5,1

"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue",This changing pad cover is made of  nice soft minky like micro fiber.  It washed well and fits perfectly and was a great price.,4,1
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue",I purchased this before our little one was born.  The fabric is very soft and it fit my changing pad perfectly. I only had one cover which I didn't think was a problem until I realized that baby's grandparents and the sitter couldn't change a poopy diaper without it ending up all over the cover.  After washing it almost everyday I broke down and purchased another. The first one us held up well to the 24/7 use and constant washing!,5,1
Tupperware Ideal Little Bowl Set,I love them. They are the perfect size for what I need them for. The different colors add to their attractiveness. That are handy for small needs.,5,1
Mini Co-Sleeper,"We LOVE this co-sleeper bassinet! How wonderful to have your baby right next to you & be able to just reach down to pick them up so easily. Perfect for breastfeeding moms. It makes it so easy to feed him in the middle of the night without having to get out of bed. It's also nice to look over & be reassured that he's breathing.They don't recommend this, but I have used other bassinet sheets (not meant for the Arms Reach co-sleeper) just as back up sheets & they seem to be just fine. The mattress pad idea sounds great (per the other reviewer). I think  I'll give that a shot too because it would be nice if the mattress were waterproof.I love this product & would recommend it to anyone (even moms who aren't breastfeeding). =)",5,1
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Bassinet Leg Extension Kit, Natural",I needed the extensions for my ideal cosleeper. Works perfectly. I have a bed height of about 32 inches. Totally keeps my twins at arms reach. Which it's perfect through out the night,5,1
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Bassinet Leg Extension Kit, Natural",These leg extensions worked perfectly and match our co-sleeper color exactly.  This has been a great purchase and we would recommend it to others needing something similar for a co-sleeper.,5,1

Imse Vimse Cloth Organic Cotton Nursing Pads,"I loved these after both of my pregnancies. I'm not a big leaker & these were perfect. They fit well, were not noticeable through my shirt & were easy to wash.",5,1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"I absolutley love this stroller!!!  We live in Japan where things are small...stores, streets, & trains.  This is the perfect alternative to a cumbersome full-size stroller.  Super easy to put together and the basket holds a full diaper bag.  Turns on a dime and folds up easily--what more could you ask for?  Only downside is that with the carseat in place it is a little difficult to reach the basket, but, if you place the diaper bag with the opening facing you it can still be accessed by reaching in.  I am not looking forward to giving this up when our little one outgrows her carseat.",5,1
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"It would be perfect if the camera could also be used unplugged, just like the monitor, with a battery.",4,1
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"We bought this before our second child was born 18 months ago.  We use it EVERY night.  We also travel with it often and it is easy to set up, the picture is perfect on it still 18 months later.  My 5 year old sleeps in the same room by choice so even if we are not checking on the baby and we hear her need something or have a bad dream we can check on her.  We don't stare at it like we used to, but it is comforting to know we can always check on them without going upstairs and opening doors.  We can also see if our youngest has wet through her diaper on this, which is nice because we are able to change her in her sleep so she is not like that all night.  We absolutely LOVE this monitor, it is a must have for all parents.",5,1
ULTRASCALE MBSC-55 Digital Baby Pet Scale,"I'm extremely happy with this scale.  I received it on time and in perfect condition.  I only wish I had known about sooner!  A few years ago, my veterinarian suggested I get a baby scale to monitor my sick cat Randy's weight, but they were very expensive.  This year, again, it was suggested to get a scale for my kitty, Peaches to save going back and forth to the vet.  After a lot of research, I found this baby pet scale and it's exactly what I needed.  It's sturdy and accurate.  Since cats tend to move there is a hold button to lock the weight as soon as it registers.  Though I've only used it for my kitty so far, it's nice to know I can use it to weigh mail if needed!!  Excellent product at a great price!",5,1
Springmaid Baby Collections Bunny 4 Piece Crib Set,"It was exactly what I ordered.  Fit perfectly, fabric was soft, colors were bright.  Better and cheaper than other sets I priced in other stores and better quality.Thanks.",5,1

"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","I rated these 5 stars because they are perfect! I run a daycare and i got tired of buying diaper jeanie refills that adds up! and also cleaning that stinky covered diaper pail got old! These bags are so nice just grab one, they pop up like wipes, tie the bag shut and toss in the normal trash can! They have a clean smell to them and work even for the smelliest of diapers!",5,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","We absolutely LOVE these. I have 6 kids and have used them consistently. Right now I have a 2 1/2 y/o (lol yes we are potty training but with a new sibling you know how that is going!) and a 4 month old so these are great. They are perfect sized for a BIG mess or for 2-4 smaller messes and with the tie handles you can close and open as needed. Also we use them for messed clothes whether it be from diaper explosions or just down right dirty. We even use them for older kids clothes (shirts, socks, undies, bathing suits...a pair of my older kids pants wouldn't fit but the rest does, and I'm talking older like 10, 11 and 17!) These are great for sooo many things I don't have the time or space to list them all and for every one I can tell you I'm sure someone else can think of 5 more :-)So I'm going to give a few of you a very simple and logical answers to a two of your problems1) The smell is too strong.Ok. So I can't completely disagree with this BUT of course when something is scented and is contained the smell is going to be stronger when you first open it and keep it in the same packaging. I have a quart sized Ziploc type bag in the diaper bag and that makes them portable and the smell isn't as strong but still you smell the scent not the poop (WHICH just a IMO, these work so great and even when the scent is really faded I would still rate these better then the others I have tried because they really keep the scent in and the scent of the bag I think is more for parents to think it makes it work better)Also for those of us that use them at home I put the in a used wipes box and feed them through this helps lessen the smell AND bring me two the 2nd problem some people have had trouble with2) The are hard to use (get out of box)So I have a solution for this... when I get a new box I open it completely and then separate it in thirds. Don't separate the bags  just put them in a empty pop up wipes box then carefully feed one through the pop up area and then gently pull up and use, the others will follow as long as you don't yank them out too hard or pull too fast. Easy, simple and you are re-purposing something :-)",5,1
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count",We use these for picking up our dog's waste while camping.  They are perfect for this.,5,1
Playard - Laurel Oak,"I needed to find a solid, well-built playpen to bring everywhere so my infant son would have a safe, comfortable place to stretch out and/or sleep.  This playpen filled the bill perfectly.  It's simple, easy to assemble, safe, and inexpensive.",5,1
"Tuffo Water-Resistant Outdoor Blanket, Navy Plaid",I love this blanket.  It is perfect for indoors and outdoors.  It is just big enough for about two adults and a child.  It is great because if you spill something on it all you have to do is wipe it off.  It comes with a carrying case.  The blanket folds easily and is easy to store. I highly recommend it!,5,1
"Tadpoles Classics Gingham Crib Bumper, Blue","Pretty and nice width.  The ties were a bit problematic for use in a IKEA crib, but still usable.  Didn't line up perfectly because the IKEA crib did not have slats all around.  Probably fine in a ""normal"" crib.  The product quality and appearance were very nice.",4,1
Leachco Natural Boost - Adjustable Nursing Pillow - Denim,"I've used the Boppy and the BrestFriend, but this pillow beats them all.  It's wide enough to ensure your baby doesn't slide off, which was my problem w/ the Boppy, and it adjustable pillow makes a perfect angle for your baby's head as he/she nurses.  It's especially nice that you don't have to fumble around trying to strap on the pillow, as you would w/ the BrestFriend -- something which was NOT pleasant to do with those middle of the night feedings.I've also washed this pillow several times.  Yes, it will flatten out w/ washings, but you can spot clean, which is what the manufacturer recommends.  Even if it does flatten out, it's so reasonably priced that you may as well buy another.",5,1
"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White","I  very happy that I purchased these for all the outlets in our home. They fit perfectly on all our outlets and don't even look that bad. I also haven't had any issues with plugging in items. They take a little work to open which is exactly what I want to prevent my daughter from accessing the outlet. What I love the most is not having to deal with the individual outlet covers--pulling them out to use the outlet, putting them in a place where my daughter can't reach them and then remembering to plug them back in. Additionally, if my daughter pulls out a cord that's plugged in, the covers automatically slide shut. In my opinion, they are definitely the best option for child proofing outlets.",5,1
Kel Gar Tubbly Elephant Bubble Bath Dispenser,My kids have bumped their heads on the metal spout plenty of times. Once my daughter even stood up right next to it and scratched her back right near her spine. I felt so bad and couldn't wait to buy some type of faucet protector. I am so glad I saw and bought this one. My kids love it and I have no regrets of buying it. Was a little nervous at first reading the reviews but it fit our spout perfectly (we have the spout without the shower divider),5,1
Primo Freedom Trainer (Toilet Trainer) (White),"I was a little apprehensive about ordering this product, as I read all of the negative comments.  I ordered it anyway, because good comments described the potty as one that would benefit my son. When it arrived (earlier than expected), I noticed that it was easy to assemble, and that because it is not made with very thick plastic, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to order this for BIG children who are potty training.  My son is 18 months old, and 22 lbs, and it is perfect for him, sturdy enough for him to climb up and use the potty.  He really enjoys climbing up himself, and it does encourage him to be more independent in the process.  I let him look at the box, and we talked about how the little girl was going potty, and he liked seeing the little girl on the box :) using the potty, ""just like him"".  So if your child is very big, or potty training at 3+ years, I wouldn't order this,they don't need it. I would just get a stool.",5,1
Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat,"Great, simple potty seat that fits on my toilet perfectly.  I feel like my daughter is safe on it and it makes her feel like a grown up since the basic white matches perfectly. Great value, who needs all those bells and whistles.",5,1
"Sunshine Kids Grip It Car Seat Gripper, Gray",So much cheaper than competitors and works the same.  It is perfect for daughter's booster seat.  Doing makes great products.,5,1
Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail,"We have been using this for cloth diapers (bummis and oso cozy unbleached prefolds with Thirsties Duo Snap covers) and cloth wipes for about one year now, with Planet Wise Diaper Pail Liner - Ocean diaper pail liners.  When we went from the 8-15 pound diapers to the 15-30 pound ones we thought we would need to get a larger pail, but we have found that this pail remains adequate for the most part.  By the end of day two when I start the laundry regimen there are a few diapers emerging out of the pail lid, and while not ideal, it's not really a big deal either.  Besides, from what I have read and based on first hand experience, it's actually good to let air circulate through your dirty diapers, so now I intentionally use a clean corner of diaper to keep the lid propped partially open anyhow.  With a baking soda disc (Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack)in the lid compartment, and as long as I rinse soiled diapers/wipes before depositing them in the pail, there is no noticeable odor even with the lid propped open. I learned the hard way that you really do have to do the diaper laundry every two days (if you do not you will get ammonia build up - your diapers should never smell like ammonia, even when dirty), so a significantly larger pail is not necessary.  If this one were just a tad larger it would be about perfect, but for the price it's at least worthy of 4 stars.",4,1
Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail,"I know that this is a diaper pail, but I really needed something for my used litter, since I didn't want to throw a plastic bag away every day.  It's perfect!  It's small enough that it fits under my sink and it surprisingly keeps all of the odors in (and you know how potent cat urine/feces can smell!).  I highly recommend it!!",5,1
Skip Hop Dash - Canvas-Chocolate,"I have had this bag for over 2 years and it is still in great shape.  I used it with my son and now with my newborn daughter.  It is perfect for a day out, and I love that there are separate straps that attach to the stroller.  You don't have to use the separate straps on the stroller, my husband just shortens the straps and places the bag over the stroller handle.",5,1
Medela Breast Pump Accessory Set,Went perfectly with my used breast pump I bought a pump from a friend and had to buy new accessories and these fit perfectly and was really nice!!,5,1
"Kiddopotamus Beddiebye Zip Around Safety Blanket Microfleece Small, Blue","I haven't seen this sleep blanket available anywhere for awhile.  I would purchase it as baby shower gifts as I loved it for my kids.  Had the 0-6 month size (small) and the 6-12 month large size.  I used them for my kids from  birth to probably around 1 1/2 years.  They were cozy, comfortable, easy to zip and wash and it kept them warm without being bulky.  I liked the idea of the sleeveless design, but wish they had used snaps instead of the velcro as it could be loud enough to wake the baby up if the sleep blanket was being removed.  The zip-around design was perfect for easily putting it on a sleeping baby without waking.  Simply lay the open blanket on crib, lay baby on it, zip & velcro them in.",5,1
Wendy Bellissimo Honey Bee 5 Piece Crib Set,"I bought this exact pattern from a small upscale boutique before Wendy Bellisimo started designing for BRU. Needless to say, it was double the price (fortunately, I got it on clearance). I couldn't believe it when I saw it in BRU! I love the pattern and it seems like this new line is almost as high quality as her $500 brand- you can hardly see the difference! In fact, I like the quilt in this line much better than mine. I love that the bumper covers can be removed and washed. Perfect gender-neutral bedding that can be easily have blue or pink added to the nursery after the baby comes. My only ""afterthought"" is that the bumpers are very pillowy, and the American Academy of Pediatrics is recommending that you not use pillows or bumper pads in cribs as a SIDS prevention. We used ours with 3 of the 4 bumper pads and my son seems to have plenty of room. LOVE IT!!",5,1
Chicco C5 Umbrella Stroller,"We've had this stroller for about a month now, and my husband and I absolutly love this stroller! It's the perfect height for him because he's very tall, and he doesn't kick the wheels in the back anymore. I love it because of it's stylish look, it's comfortable for my daughter, 22mths. old, it's light, and it's super easy to fold down and up!!I did read the reviews before and was aware of the back bending in, which honestly steered me away from the stroller at first. It was when we actually went to Babies R Us  and saw the 2 models on the floor that made me change my mind. One of the strollers must have been the old model because I did notice how the back of the seat gave in, but the other model's seat did not. My husband felt the panels in the back of the seat, and there was a huge difference in them. Chicco must have fixed this problem because the newer ones back panels of the seats would not budge a bit when my husband tried to bend it, and the older model was way too easy bend.So, when you go to buy it, ask them to open the box and make sure you're getting the newer model with the harder seat panels!! That's what we did, and we're super happy!!!",5,1
Sumersault Puppy Plane Lampshade,"I love this lamp shade. It is really cute & matches perfectly with everything! The cost is high for just a shade, but worth it!",4,1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Bottle Brush, Blue","This is a great bottle brush. It works in just about any size container. It even squeezes into those slim tube-like containers for storing breast milk (I wasn't sure it would). It is more expensive than most bottle brushes, but it is definitely worth it because it works better, doesn't have to be replaced frequently (if ever), is easier to clean/rinse the soap off of, and cleans all bottle and pump parts very easily.Unlike most bottle brushes, this one has more spaced out bristles that are stronger and more flexible. Those flexible bristles are what make it possible to squeeze it into small containers and clean every nook and cranny of the bottle and pump parts that have a lot of nooks and crannies. The strength of the bristles keeps it from losing its shape and function after squeezing it into those nooks and crannies. No matter how much I abuse it (by using it to clean those small milk storage containers), it never shows. Plus it doesn't have that gross falling apart sponge thing at the end that others have. I also have the Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack and this bottle brush fits perfectly into the little cup container at the top of it.",5,1
Kidco White Door Lever Locks,This product is perfect for keeping my Grandson safe. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with little ones running around!,5,1
"Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary","This powdered formula dispenser is one of my favorite baby gadgets! Three compartments hold pre-measured formula amount, so when baby wakes for a middle of the night feeding, all you have to do is flip the lid open and dump the formula into the bottle. Small enough to throw in the diaper bag, and perfect for errands or daycare. That way you don't have to rely on someone else to get the measuring right. It's inexpensive, easy to clean, even easier to use, and totally worth the few bucks it costs. I just ordered another!",5,1
Infantino Cart Safari w/Microban,perfect for what its supposed to be. my 9 month old still loves this. i bought this when she was around 6 months. paid a little more for this particular one and was slightly disapointed at how little extra padding was in the seat part compared to the others i have seen but other than that i love it,5,1
SKIP HOP Dash Diaper Bag - Black,"I'm an organizer and this bag is perfect for everything. I don't need to carry a purse when I use it. I agree the main compartment could be a bit bigger, but other than that it's great.",4,1
Playtex The World of Cars Insulator 9 oz - 2 Pack,"This is the only sippy my 17 month old has that does not leak. The cars are also an added bonus, and a great distraction. Perfect for any parent looking for a travel cup for a young tot. Just remember to let all of the pieces dry separately or you'll get mold in them.",5,1
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium",I have purchased a few of these swaddle wraps but prefer the cotton material rather than the microfleece material but they are still a great product.I have been using these wraps for 5 months now and they are fantastic.  My bubs is 11 months old and he is a tall boy and yet they still fit him (although not for much longer).  In winter I wrap him with a muslin wrap underneath and then with this wrap and he stays super warm.  It is summer in Australia now so I use just the swaddle wrap now and its perfect.  Most nights he stays wrapped the entire night but he can wiggle his arms out if he wants which is fine at this age because if he turns onto his stomach he can use his arms to turn over again.,5,1
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium",My son would not sleep without this!!!!!!!!!!! It was a life saver for me and when he grew out of the size small I got this one in large and it worked perfect!!!!!!!!! It is the only kind he couldn't wiggle out of :),5,1
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium","I ordered this because my son was breaking out of my blanket swaddle, but is still young enough to wake himself up with the startle reflex. He sleeps so well in this. If he falls asleep in our arms, we can transfer him without him waking up. I ordered two so I can wash and have a back up. It's perfect!",5,1
Boppy Newborn Lounger,"I ordered this on amazon before my baby was even born.  Once it arrived I started to wonder why I ordered it and what on earth I'd do with it.  It has turned out to be an absolute lifesaver.  She LOVES this thing, my husband and I could not do without it.  She fits in it perfectly and has since she was born.  She is now 9 weeks old and still using it day in and day out.  I'm very safety conscious but I let her sleep in it (for naps only) because I cannot for the life of me figure out why not.  I agree with a previous reviewer that they are just putting warnings on it for liability sake.  It is also PERFECT for taking to other people's houses and letting her lay on it while we are there, because it is so portable.  The only thing I wish I had known was that they make a cover for it because you cannot put the lounger in the washing machine.  I highly recommend the cover for it because if your baby blows out diaper you've got a real mess on your hands.  Trust me. LOL",5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"I purchased this as a gift. I have the same exact one. I used it at the beach last year and the sand just shakes right off. I had another blanket with a handle and the underside was flannel and it was HOT to sit on. This one is perfect. I would just say the picture of the people sitting on it is a little deceiving, as you can probably only fit one adult and a child or two OR two adults comfortably. Not the whole family.",5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"How did I not think to register for one of these?  This is an absolute must-have for anyone who wants to be outside with their baby...or anyone!  Perfect for the park, beach, backyard, and I even use it in the house on our hardwoods.  It's great because it isn't bulky and folds up nicely, so it's easy to put in the bottom of a stroller or just carry on your shoulder.  And the fact it can be used by anyone of any age, it's a great product to just have on hand.",5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,I take this with us every time we go on a trip to the coast. It is perfect for sitting or laying on for the beach. Never lets the dampness of the wet sand through and is a lot more comfortable than a towel any day.,5,1
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"This blanket, with its felt side and waterproof opposite side, is perfect for family picnics, lawn concerts or even outdoor events in bad weather when it can be used as a stadium blanket.  Folds itself into a large hanging  bag with shoulder strap.  Perfect for 2 adults, 2 kids and accompanying gear.JJ Cole Collections All-Purpose Blanket, Gray/Green",5,1
"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant","I got this for my 2-month-old and it has been great.  It is warm enough that we don't have to bundle our little guy up to the point where he's smothered when we're taking him from place to place.  The fit isn't perfect, but it does what it says it does.",5,1
Graco Digital Deluxe iMonitor Baby Monitor,"We just had our first child and bought this monitor cause the 900 mhz fischer price monitor had very poor reception and a lot of static.. This monitor is everything you would want in a monitor. Cristal clear reception, You can hear baby perfectly!!The unit has rechargeable batteries which is a big plus for me. All in all I highly recommend this monitor. It will be what you were expecting!!!",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Bath Center - Aquarium,"I got this for my baby girl and both she and I love it!!!  She doesn't slip and it is really comfortable for her.  She really enjoys bathtime.  And, if you follow the way the hammock should be used for the size of your baby...  you will really enjoy it.  I wanted this prior to my baby being born, but I read some of the reviews and I didn't buy it for her.  After the first month of her using another tub, and having trouble with the product, I decided to buy this Aquarium tub that I wanted in the first place.  Caution:  Please use the hammock as directed for your baby's size.  This tub is perfect if you do that!  The reviews that I read about the hammock being too small or the bump in the middle of the tub were laughable when I actually read the directions before use.  Please read the directions.  Both you and your child will appreciate that you did!",5,1
"Playtex Ventaire Bubble Free Silicone Feeding Nipples, Stage 2 Fast Flow  - 2 Pack","I bought these to fit all of my medela bottles since my daughter wanted faster flow nipples and medela does not make any (yet). They fit perfectly with the regular bottle ring/cuffs. I did have a few bottles (medela) that had a extra wide cuff, which these did not fit, but that's ok since it's a lot easier to clean/reuse cuffs than clean nipples. My daughter was much happier with the faster flow (needed the switch at 4.5 mo).",5,1
Sunshine Kids Stuff 'n Scuff Seat Protector - Black,"I have used this product for over five years and it has been through three vehicles and still holding up.  It is starting to show a little wear so I am purchasing new ones.  I strongly disagree with the previous reviews on the quality, unless your child is an animal or monster, these will work for you perfectly.",5,1
Medela Breastmilk Freezing &amp; Storage (*BPA Free) - 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging #87061 (Pack of 12 Bottles),"I use these with my Medela pump in style advanced with no issues whatsoever. I love them better then the bags, they are easier to store in my opinion, they don't leak, easy to thaw, easy to heat in a bottle warmer. They are the perfect 2 oz size for my newborn baby who takes between 2-4 oz per feeding. I have bought 2 boxes to keep me going for a while.",5,1
Medela Breastmilk Freezing &amp; Storage (*BPA Free) - 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging #87061 (Pack of 12 Bottles),I love that they can be washed & resued unlike bags which are a one-time use.  I also love that you can add more milk (un-like a bag).  The size is perfect and they store great.,5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","Love this stroller! Best thing for my two boys! My oldest is 3, youngest is 10 months and it couldnt be more perfect! Pleasantly surprised with every detail!",5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I bought this because of the sale price but ended up loving it!  I have a newborn and a 2 1/2 year old, so this works perfect because I can put the infant carseat on the front.  My 2 year old loves the option of standing or sitting, and since he likes to constantly get off and on, this is so much easier than a traditional double stroller where I'd have to lift him in and out.  It's a little heavy and a little more challenging to maneuver (due to the extra length), but I imagine any double stroller would be that way.  I don't use this every day because my 2 year old doesn't need to ride very often, but when we go to the zoo, mall, or anywhere else we'll be walking a lot, this is exactly what I needed.  The only thing missing is a cup holder for me!  They sell add-on ones, but they were too pricy in my opinion.",4,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black",I have (soon to be) 7 daughters. The youngest are age 3 and 17 months (and I'm due again in 2 months). This stroller is great. It gives my independent 3 year old the option to sit or stand and she loves it. She likes riding on the grocery cart the same way so this stroller seemed to be perfect. We liked it so much that I purchased the triple stroller from E bay (used). I'm sure we will get tons of use out of it as well. I like that it holds the carseat with no fuss and another child can still ride comfortably. I will definitely recommend this stroller to anyone with more than one child under the age of 5/6 and the triple if you have a litter like I do! It is well worth the price.,5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","This stroller has been a big hit with both mom and toddler for us!  It's better than I thought it would be when I saw it online!  What attracted me to the stroller initially was that the seat had a 5 point harness, a seat in the back for my 3 year old to sit or stand, a storage basket underneath and a snack/drink tray for the youngest in the front.  My in-laws gave this to my husband and myself as a gift (we're expecting baby #3 any day now)!  Once the stroller was here and we put it together which by the way took only 5 minutes and I was able to do it myself it had soooo many more features than I had expected.  There's a nice little mesh bag on the back of the front seat and the height handle of the bar is perfect (most stroller bars are so low you actually are hunched over to push the stroller), and BEST of all is that there is a seat belt on the back seat so that the oldest child can still be buckled in (great when you have a wild child like mine!).  The back seat has PLENTY of room even with the infant car seat on the front (which by the way we did not have to reclline the front seat to make that happen as another reviewer has said).  It folds easily, steers BEAUTIFULLY, and is as compact as a single stroller (though a little bit longer).  The FEW improvements it could use is that the storage basket underneath is rather small and could be difficult to get to, it would be nice to have a drink holder for mom and dad (keys, wallets, ect. can go in that small mesh bag on the back of the seat) but drink holders can be picked up most anywhere, and the front seat does not recline very far at all (but most kids when tired can fall asleep most anywhere although it can't really be used with an infant unless they're in an infant carier to recline in), it would also be nice if there was some sort of locking mechanism to keep the back bench from sliding  But these issues are very minor for us.  I had a baby trend sit and stand for my now 7 year old and 3 year old when the 3 year old was born and hardly ever used it, I hated it.  The baby trend sit and stand did not fold down well, did not have a seat belt on the back seat to keep my then 4 year old seated, did not have a 5 point harness or a snack/drink tray in the front for baby, and did not have as much space in the back for the older child, it also diid not have that locking mechanism for the back bench, the universal car seat attachment was more difficult to use than the one that comes with the JOOVY so we simply never bothered with it .  The one plus that it DID have that the Joovy does not is that the front seat reclined quite far (but of course then there was no room in the back whatsoever).  I prefer the Joovy by far and my 3 year old son absolutely loves it as well, he thinks he's such a big boy riding in the back!",5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I did some research online about sit and stand strollers and was trying to decide between the Baby Trend LX Sit and Stand or the Joovy. I bought the Baby Trend because there were no local stores that carried the Joovy for me to look at it. So, I bought the Baby Trend, took it home, strolled around my house and found it was to big, I was hitting wall corners and could not see what was infront of me. I would have to lift the stroller to go around tight corners. So, I went on the hunt to fond this Joovy stroller to test out. I finally found a retailer, drove 40 miles to test it out and it was worth it. I could manouver it well, I had my son sitting and my infant car seat attached and strolled around the store perfectly. It was easy to fold and pick up also. Attachments went on and came off easily. I was so pleased, wondering what the bad reviews were about, those people are crazy!! Here are some things I found were not hard or inconvienat at all that others did:1. The storage basket accessability: Yes, when your child is standing or sitting in the back area it is impossible to get to the basket from there, BUT WHY WOULD YOU ANYWAY???? The sides pull out so far that there is no need to access the basket any other way.2.The wheels do not turn well: OK, this has to be due to no readng the owners manual! There is a lock on the front wheels that keeps them from swiveling if in lock posistion. Once unlocked the wheels swivel to make sharp turns at ease. The only way I knew this is because I read the manual!3. The rear seat has little room when front seat in reclined: This is a fact, BUT the back seat slides back and forth, so if the seat is reclined you just pull the back seat foward more! AGAIN, READ THE MANUAL!4.No parent tray: OK, this was the only one that I can say is valid. BUT, there are so many universal trays out there and accessories to hold drinks, phones, MP3 players, ect that this should not be a big deal. Joovy sales one for the stroller, which is a little pricey, but I bought a off brand for a quarter of the price and it works great.So, overall I LOVE this stroller and I am so happy I went with it and not the Baby Trend. It is great when shopping in retail stores, manuovers great and my older son can get in and out easily without me breaking my back lifting his 35 pound body. If you are questioning to buy this product online, in my opinion, DO IT, you will not be disappointed unless you want more cup holders than needed and a heavy uncomfortable stroller!",5,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black",I'll start with the con---it's heavy and the parent organizer cost extra.  Now the positives are it fits my Chicco car-seat perfectly! It's great for my NB son and 2 1/2 year daughter. she sometimes sits and sometimes walks.  When she is to big to sit then I can still use the stroller. Not like the doubles that I would  be pushing a huge empty stroller around.  great for those with two young kids (just not twins).  I also like the material-durable feel and easy to wipe. Very little assembly required- I did it myself in 20 mins and no tools.  Ps- I was able to purchase this for 99$ from joovy website with free shipping.  So lookout for special offers. AND yes there is little room for child on bench when front seat reclined-but my DD doesn't seem to care and can still sit.  Maybe a chubby child would have difficulty.....,4,1
14X29 Bassinet Pad,I bought a bassinet and it had this really thin and flimsy bassinet pad to go with it.  I was horrified that it would somehow suffocate my son so I got this one.  It is a perfect fit and I love it...trouble now is finding bassinet sheets to fit.,5,1
"Sugarbooger Classic Lunch Sack, Dia De Los Muertos","This is the second Sugarbooger lunch sack I have bought on Amazon. The first one has worked out so well that I just bought this cute monster one for my son to take with him to preschool. It is laminated so it is easy to wipe down inside and out. We load ours with a stainless steel eco-lunchbox stacker (which fits perfectly) or a Foogo Thermos and maybe a granola bar or a piece of fruit. I'm pretty sure it will also fit Lunchbots or most rectangular food containers and bentos. It holds more than enough food, is easy to carry and clean, and comes in super cute prints. The only thing it lacks (and why I'm not awarding it five stars) is an exterior pocket or mesh to put a water bottle in. If only it had a place for a water bottle it would be darn near perfect for the price!",4,1
"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Brownstone",Our son is on the big side and this seat is perfect for him.We previously had the Roundabout and it was great too ... but seemed to be already small for him. The Boulevard is more cushioned and our son seems more comfortable. I would highly recommend Britax -- worth every penny!,5,1
"Graco Travel Lite Crib Sheet, Pink","I like this sheet and it fits the travel lite crib mattress perfectly, but I really wish there were colors other than the drab pink and candlestick.",4,1
"Graco Travel Lite Crib Sheet, Pink",Wonderful to have a perfect fit for this.  Snug to mattress to keep baby safe.  Washed well.  Would recommend to anyone wanting to keep mattress clean.,5,1
KidCo BabySteps Electric Food Mill - White,"Started to introduce solid foods and ordered this based on others ratings.

Medela PersonalFit Connectors,"I need to pump twice at work, so I bought these connectors. It works perfect! The shipping is fast too.",5,1
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,I am so happy to have finally received these. I have had such painful problems while pumping and after reading the Medela site and looking at the breast shield diagrams I knew the ones that came with the pump were too big. I am pumping right now and OMG what a difference! I am so happy I could cry...probably due to hormones! No pain!I dreaded pumping due to the pain it caused and the soreness afterwards. Everything feels better and it isn't rubbing or taking too much in. This is the perfect size!I wish Medela gave you options with the breast shields when you buy the pump. I mean for $300 bucks I shouldn't have to pay an additional $15 to get the right size! They should really give options when getting these pumps so you don't have problems with pain and discomfort.,5,1
,"Baby sleeps in this every single night. The velboa is just the softest, nicest fabric. I really prefer it to the fleece. It doesn't get as hot, and it's just softer. Perfect for baby.",5,1

"Boon Frog Pod Bath Toy Scoop,Green","I adore this boon product! I love that is provides convenient storage for all of the bath-time essentials and it is cute and sturdy! It stays put and my son loves looking at it during bath-time. I even hang wash clothes on  the &#34;hands&#34; to dry out before throwing them in the dirty clothes. The little soap bottle shelf is perfect too! I love that it isnt a little mesh-net and that it doesnt have suction-cups to stay in place (bc those NEVER work). One piece of advice though...if you bathe your child in a garden tub or something other than a typical bath tub, make sure you have enough wall-space to hang this guy. He is pretty long and wide and he needs a decent sized wall to hang to. Just keep this in-mind!",4,1
"Boon Frog Pod Bath Toy Scoop,Green","I have had this Frog Pod for four years and I love it (so does my son).  I bought one of these when they first came out and haven't regretted it for a minute.  I didn't want to use the adhesive that came with it because it said it was permanent (This was long before the suction cups) and I didn't want to do a lot of scraping to remove the adhesive when he got older so I used command adhesive instead and it worked perfectly.  It has never fallen in 4 years.Yes it is big, I was surprised by that too but I don't believe it is an unreasonable size for the amount of bath toys your average child has. I think most new parents (like me) just don't realize how many bath toys are going to accumulate!.  I have had to rotate my son's bath toys over the years to have them all fit.I would definitely buy this again and have bought them for several of my friends.  It is a delightful design and a wonderful color that alway brings a smile to my face when i see it.  I love that it provides such neat storage and makes it soooooo easy to pick up all the toys at the end of the bath.  When my son was younger he used to love to watch the water coming back out of the holes as we cleaned up now he loves to clean up himself because it makes it so fun.  Often he will dump out the toys in the bath and play with the scoop instead.  I have even used it for rinsing the shampoo out of his hair.I am not discounting the people that couldn't get the pod to stay on the wall I am sure it was frustrating but if you are one of the people, like me, who can get it to stay GREAT product, GREAT design, GREAT functionality. LOTS OF FUN!",5,1
"Boon Frog Pod Bath Toy Scoop,Green",This is the perfect solution to the bath time diliema of mildewy bathtoys and lack of storage space.  I love the scoop it is so easy to get all of the toys cleaned up in one swipe.  The only downfall is that it randomly falls off the wall but it only happens once in a while.,5,1
Combi Twin Savvy EX Double Stroller Pattern: Silver Breeze,"This stoller has everything I was looking for on it.  Separate canopies, accepts infant carseat, fully reclines, folds compactly, snack tray for each child, and it looks nice. When I ordered the stroller I wasn't sure I was going to like the seat adjustment straps.  I thought they were like bra straps (like a lot of Gracos have), but they are made like a drawstring instead...nice, easy to use.  Makes for a smoother transition for a sleeping child to be layed down. As for the roominess, My daughter doesn't have a ton of room like in her single stroller, but if I had been concerned with that I would have purchased a front/back double stroller, not a side-by-side. If they had a lot of room you would never fit through any doors and you would lose the compactness and lightness of the stroller (which in my opinion is the point of buying this stroller!) Folding and unfolding is a very easy process. Folded, it isn't much larger than my single peg perego pliko 3. I am impressed. The wheels are not made for tough terrain (I wouldn't recommend anything more than light, small gravel not deeply layered)  Best for trips to the mall, doctors office, strolls around town or the neighborhood on concrete surfaces. The baskets aren't huge, but there are two of them and if you've had a peg perego then you'll already be used to having a small basket...this one will seem like a dream because they are atleast easily accessible. If you use one diaper bag for two kids, I recommend purchasing a bag that has straps that you can unclip so that you can clip it to the handle bars. You can't hang anything from them and a large bag for two kids most likely will not fit in one of the baskets. I love the material on the stroller.  It not only looks nice, but feels really good too.  Kind of silky, but not cheap feeling...thick.  The canopies come way down to cover the baby's face and block the sun, they have a peekaboo window on each one, and a rather large air vent window which can be rolled up in the back.  The canopies even zip off for removal (although I'm not sure I'll ever need/want to remove them, it's good to know).  All in all this was the perfect stroller for us. The maclaren and inglesia look awesome too if both of your children are out of an infant carrier, but the combi definitely beats them out for those of us who like the convenience of using the infant carrier in their stroller. I also purchased the rain cover. It actually comes down over a toddlers feet! Most of the universal ones don't seem to do that. Who wants wet feet??  Hope this helps!",5,1
Fisher-Price Coco Sorbet Soothing Motions Glider,WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT. WHEN MY DAUGHTER CAME HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL IT WAS PERFECT. THE GLIDER IS LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD THE BABY WITH ROOM FOR MOVEMENT. BUT VERY STABLE AND SAFE. I CHOSE THIS GLIDER BECAUSE OF THE BASE WHICH MAKES IT VERY STABLE. NOT LIKE THE OTHER SEATS THAT REMIND ME OF A OVERSIXED WIRE HANGER. I FEEL SECURE AND CALM WHEN MY DAUGHTER IS IN THIS PRODUCT.SHE'S  PRETTY SATISFIED IN THERE TOO. I WOULD BUY THIS FOR ANY FUTURE BABY SHOWERS I ATTEND. A GREAT. SAFE PRODUCT.,5,1

Summer Infant Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor with 5&quot; Screen,"We have been using this monitor for over three years. This is actually our second. The first one we had for two years and the video stopped working (but I also dropped it). I called Summer Bend and told them about it and since it was past the warranty they couldn't give me a free one, but they told me to send it in and then they sent me a new one for $35. I thought it was very nice of them. Every once in a while we get a little static, but figured it was because there was too much in between the camera and the video, so we just put the video monitor a little higher to bypass the interference and it works perfectly. I love it and would recommend it to anyone.",4,1
"BABYBJORN Soft Bib, Red",This bib perfectly fits my 14 month old. Food that would easily have landed in her lap now just falls down the front of the bib and she eagerly picks it out of the pocket. We're reduced many wet clothes as most other bibs don't work quite this well.,5,1
"BABYBJORN Soft Bib, Red","I've gone through SO many bibs, and this is the BEST one by far. It catches food, soup, everything since it's moulded to stay popped out, whereas other plastic bibs like this fold back in, and all the food goes on their lap. The strap stays put- your child can't yank it off. Washes easily and doesn't stain like other bibs. Perfect in every way.",5,1
"BABYBJORN Soft Bib, Red","This bib is the best.  It is easy to clean by just rinsing under the tap or wiping down with a damp paper towel. The pocket is perfect and catches food that would have ended up in my baby's lap if he were wearing any other bib.  The neck size is completely adjustable, and the bonus is that this is the one bib I've tried that my baby can't pull off on his own.  I loved it so much that I bought a second one for day care.",5,1
Eddie Bauer Deluxe Convertible Car Seat,"We searched high and low to find a convertible car seat for my 7 month old son.  He's already over 20 pounds but can't face forward for another 5 months - so all those other car seats that only hold 40 pounds total were going to be a waste of money for us. This seat holds 80 pounds total, so this is one baby item he won't be growing out of so soon!  Parents - please remember that your baby needs to face backwards until they are at least 20 pounds AND over 1 year old!The seat itself was a breeze to put together.  It went from box to back seat in about 20 minutes.  It comes completely put together except that you have to adjust the shoulder straps to the height of your baby.  The first time we put my wiggly little guy in the seat, everything clipped together like a charm.  No pinched fingers, no digging for straps under his legs, no frustrated Mommy or Baby.The seat fits nicely with room to spare in our mini-suv.  We could even move the passenger seat back a little from where the seat had to be for the baby car seat we just replaced.  And speaking of - this car seat IS NOT for newborn babies.  If you are buying your baby's first car seat - buy a baby seat.  These convertible car seats are for infants and toddlers NOT little babies - and once you start shopping around for anything from toys to books to clothes you will know there is a big difference between babies and infants.This chair sits up straighter than a baby seat.  My little boy was tired of laying down in his baby seat by the time he hit the 20 pound limit, so the new sitting position in this seat is much better.  However, if your child can't hold their own head up or tip up their own bottle or sippy cup, they won't be able to give themselves a drink. Speaking of - the entire top cover comes off EASILY and you can throw it in the washing machine!  With or without mashed-in bananas and cheerios and milk!Also - when your little one does fall asleep in this chair - have a pillow or a rolled up blanket to catch their necks.  Their heads will tilt down if you don't. That's gravity's fault - not the chair's.Basically, if you have a little one who likes to sit up and look out the window or amuse themselves in the back seat - this car seat is perfect.  Comfortable, affordable, SAFE, and easy to use.  It's the same amount of quality you'd expect from any Eddie Bauer product and I highly recommend it.",5,1
Eddie Bauer Deluxe Convertible Car Seat,I am a new grandma and this car seat will be perfect for most stages as the grandkids come to visit.  It is flexible enough for all sizes of the kids and seems very solid and safe in my back seat.  A little difficult to install but worth it.,5,1
Fisher-Price Aquarium Take-Along Swing,"Space is tight in our home, so this swing is perfect.  I love that I can move it from room to room.  I bring it into the bathroom to occupy my son while I shower.  He usually falls asleep and doesn't wake up until I've showered and dressed.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because my in-laws have a full-size swing and my son seems to like not being so low to the ground in their swing.",4,1
North States Supergate Pressure Mount Clear Choice Wood Gate,"This gate has worked perfectly for my small chihuahuas, one of whom likes to fight the occasional necessity for containment. I wouldn't want her to get her paw stuck, or a nail stuck on a wire or plastic grated fence. Also this prevents her from chewing on an open fence. Very strong and works perfect for my needs.",5,1
North States Supergate Pressure Mount Clear Choice Wood Gate,Our 19 month old great-niece visited from Alaska and we needed to block her access to our open basement stairway. The Supergate worked great. It was high enough that she couldn't crawl over it and the clear plastic was safe for her little fingers and hands. She slapped the plastic with her hands a few times and the gate didn't budge. The gate is easy to put up and take down as needed (no tools required) and the size was perfect for our needs.,5,1
North States Supergate Pressure Mount Clear Choice Wood Gate,"I got a couple of these to corral my new puppy in the kitchen area of our house. They work great for that. However, I am 5'7"", not short, and sometimes it can be difficult to step over the gate. (They are easy to remove and replace as needed)If they were a couple inches shorter they'd be perfect. That aside, this is a great, inexpensive solution to a common problem.Edit to add: I have been using these gates for about 4 months now, and they have been kicked, tripped over, and otherwise mis-treated. They are both holding up perfectly fine. I don't know what the people were doing to break their gates, but it must have been something akin to nuclear war! I am very happy with this purchase, and have actually been considering buying another one to keep the adventurous pup from going upstairs, where she then cries for someone to come get her. *eye roll*7-27-10, edit to add: Been using these two gates I bought over a year ago and they are still in great shape. They've been heartily abused by dogs and humans alike, with zero problems. I just raised my rating because I realized that these are SO much better than many gates that have holes or slats that super naughty pups can climb!2-2013: I *still* have and use the two gates I bought, they still work great!",4,1
"Sassy Baby Mealtime On the Go Feeding Set, Colors May Vary","I love these containers. They are perfect for packing my 1 year old son a meal when we go places. Since they have invidual dishes that go inside, they are great for packing hot and cold foods together. I can just take out the cold dishes before microwaving. I also use the small inside containers as snack containers. The lids seal very well too. They may not be tupperware but I have never had anything leak.  I bought four containers and so far I love them and both of my son's grandmas love them.",5,1
Munchkin Dora the Explorer Bath Squirters,absolutly perfect for my granddaughter who is in love with Dora! She will spend a lot of time taking baths!!,5,1
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade - Single - Black,I have the Guzzie and Guss 102 full size stroller and this fits perfect. I love that I can pull it down and protect my LO from sun but she can still see through- then lay the flap down when shes napping to keep it dark ;) Everything I thought it would be and more!!! My only complaint is I paid a higher price and it went on sale 2wks later! Ack. Oh well- still well worth it!,5,1
Peg Perego Aria Twin Double Stroller in Toffee,"I love this stroller!  I hunted high and low and it came down to the Aria Twin or the Maclaren Twin Techno.  Both were great but we settled on the Aria Twin because of a few things.  Ultralight weight...I am 5'1"" and this is easy to fold and load in to my SUV.  Also, it has a great basket underneath, steers easily with one hand and each seat reclines to almost flat.  It also has a tray that does two things, keeps the kids in the stroller and it's easily utilized for snacks, etc.  When we tested the Maclaren my older daughter who is 3-1/2 kept on leaping out of the stroller because it did not have a tray.  Of course you can buckle them in repeatedly but it can become a pain if you are using this stroller at let's say the mall or Disneyland like we do.I've read many reviews on this stroller and I must say that if you are looking for a ultralight weight stroller with great style and durability, this is the only choice.  We used this stroller traveling to Maui just recently and it was perfect.  We also use this stroller at Disneyland frequently (we have annual passes and go almost every weekend)and it definetely gets and A+!  We also have a Graco DuoGlider and this is a 1/4 of the weight.  We enjoyed the DuoGlider, too but that was a beast!  Something like 35 lbs. without kids and stuff in it.  Yikes!  Try pushing that around for 8 hours at Disneyland!  The Aria Twin is a stroller well worth the money, you won't be disappointed.",5,1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I have this night light in my baby's room and it's perfect for when I have to get up in the middle of the night and feed her. The three different colors are great and I think it'll be perfect for our little one as she grows up.,4,1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 3 year old had been begging for a Dream Lite. After seeing lots of negative reviews for the ship time, etc for that product, I decided to go with this one. My son did not know any difference and has been carrying it around for weeks now. He uses it every time he sleeps. Works great, other than the amber color being dim, but blue and green are perfect.",5,1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is absolutely the best night light I've bought so far. We only have blinds covering the windows, so there's always quite a bit of outdoor light shining in, but this little lady bug really works! It projects perfectly shaped stars onto the walls and every night my little one positions it so that the moon is right above her head. It's her little nighttime routine to &#34;find the moon&#34;. Ladybug is right next to her pillow and even though the light shining through the little holes is quite strong, it's not bothersome. The plush is very soft and the quality is very sturyd. The colors (red, blue, green) are very nice and soft, which makes the whole atmosphere so magical. We now have a little game every night where we try to &#34;catch&#34; the stars while singing &#34;Twinkle Twinkle&#34;... Absolutely love it!",5,1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",My son loves his new turtle. I wish it was darker at bedtime for him to enjoy it but I'm sure he will in the fall/winter. I also think there should be music. The turtle is a perfect night light. The turtle is soft and has a flap over the bottom to cover the battery cover. Fantastic idea!,4,1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!  This is THE best children's night light ever.  The three different color settings are wonderful; not only does your child get to choose which color they want each night (which makes it fun for them), but the colors are soothing (the amber is very conducive for sleep), and the effect of the stars on the ceiling and walls creates a sense of awe (I wanted to have one in my room, too!).  The automatic shut-off after 45 minutes is awesome; the perfect amount of time for your child to peacefully fall asleep while the light is still on.",5,1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My 8-month-old son loves it. Some people said they can't see the yellow stars, but we can; even though my walls are beige. Its good when you want to put your kid in bed or just to play with it. Its a perfect gift for a little one.",5,1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Thought my year old was a little too young for this but he LOVES it.  He pushes all the buttons to turn on/off and changes the colors.  He looks at the stars on the ceiling and oohs and aahs.  The brown/yellow is a little too dim for the ceiling but if he has it in his crib this is perfect when he goes to bed since it's not too bright.  Great price too - cheaper than in the stores!,5,1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I love twilight ladybug!  She is amazing her lights work great, it makes an awesome nightlight.  My daughter is two and she look forward to going to bed now just so she can look at the stars all over her ceiling.  The lights are bright and the stars show up perfectly on the ceiling.  Its the best night light ever.  I wish I had something like this when I was a kid.  I highly recommend this for kids of all ages.",5,1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","This is the perfect little night light.  The amber is a little dim, but has become our favorite as it is not over-powering and does not distract when our boy is trying to fall asleep.  He loves to turn his turtle on and get ready for bed.  Very cute and well made.",5,1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My wife and I purchased the Lady Bug version for our two-year-old niece as both a decorative item for her bedroom and as a night light. We and our niece's parents couldn't be any happier with it and, most importantly, the young girl absolutely adores it!The product is very well made and is soft enough for an older child to cuddle with. The three selectable colors is a nice feature, while the auto off timer is perfect for preserving battery life. Unfortunately, because it is only battery powered (no AC adpater), you will be recharging/repurchasing batteries on a regular basis.The light output is bright enough so as to be seen within a room; but, not so bright that it will keep a child from falling sound asleep. The star pattern is neat and scatters about the walls and ceiling very well.I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to replace the traditional night light with something a bit more unique and that fits either gender.",5,1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I saw this turtle while finding a suitable gift for my niece who was turning 4 this year. I read the description and ordered it. She was so excited to see it. She kept asking me where I buy gifts from coz she loved it so much. She wasnt ready to share it with anyone. Now, she uses it every night.The smile on her face....Its worth all that I paid. Its a perfect gift for kids.",5,1
"Plush Panda Bear,Bamboo Panda 17&quot;","The perfect gift for anyone. I bought it for my 17 year old boyfriend and he loves it. He's named it Fang Ping, and takes it around everywhere, even to school. I thought he'd be embarrassed by it, but he loves how huggable and soft it is. The gift note I added on to it was written on the cutest stationary, and the nose is cute, pointy, and made of leather. Would definitely recommend to others.",5,1
"American Baby Company Jersey Knit Bassinet Sheet, Blue",I was reluctant to order this fitted bassinet sheet because the bassinet pad i bought is a 15'x30'x2' and this sheet is for a 15'x33'x4'.The fitted sheet fits my bassinet pad perfectly and i love that it is a soft jersey knit to be comfortable for the baby since i bought a more firm basinet pad.,5,1
"American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover, White","I ordered this to provide just a little extra cushion because my daughter will be sleeping in a pack 'n play for a few months and was worried about using a soft mattress pad. I have this PnP -Graco Pack 'N Play On the Go Travel Playard, Go Greenand the sheet is snug. I'll have to make sure to wash it on the right settings so it doesn't shrink but it works perfectly.",5,1
"American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover, White",This mattress fits perfectly in our playpen.  It is soft and my daughter loves it.  She sleep in this instead of using a crib. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a playpen mattress.,5,1
"American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover, White","Fits portacrib nicely.  The mattress folds so it's got &#34;ditches&#34; in it but when I put this on, those areas can't be felt.  Just enough to slightly pad the mattress.  Washed nicely.  Quick shipping.  Perfect!",5,1
"American Baby Company Jersey Knit Crib Sheet, Lavender",This sheet is perfect for a baby!  It is super soft and fits a crib mattress great.  I need one for myself.,5,1

Kidco Safeway white G2000,"This is the perfect baby gate. Strong and ridged but not too heavy. Easy to install with simple hand tools. This is so much better than the crap they sell at Baby's R Us it's unbelievable... and at half the price. I liked it so much I bought another one (4-level split home, I might even get more than two)",5,1
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn","[Newborn Size | Lime Animal Friends]At about 14-15 lbs (2 and a half months old), our baby is on the brink of transitioning to the next size up.This swaddler doesn't have too much stretch, which means it is easy to tighten it around baby.  It's important to us to have a tight-fastening swaddler because our baby LOVES to wiggle.  When he was born, at about 7 lbs, he often got a hand out up around his face, but now his intense wiggles only pull his hands from straight down by his sides to mid-belly.  If his hands stick out the bottoms of the flaps, he is not able to wiggle the fabric upwards but is instead trapped with his arms down (unlike the cotton swaddler in this brand).It did not shrink in the wash and is soft to the touch.The velcro on this swaddler sticks to the microfleece, so that it will still attach to the swaddler even if a baby is a bit small and the velcro doesn't hit perfectly on the &#34;velcro landing pad&#34; on the other swaddle flap.  After encountering a poor fit in the cotton version of this, which does NOT allow velcro to attach to anything but the &#34;landing pad,&#34; this is incredibly important to me.Our baby sleeps incredibly well in this.  (I like to put our kiddo in baby clothes during the day and only swaddle him in the evening to encourage sleeping more at night and less during the day.  Often, he's fussy in the evening until he's fed and swaddled, and then he drops off and sleeps in 3-4 hour stretches between feedings.)  Every source says that most babies love to be swaddled because it feels more like being in the womb.  Our kiddo sleeps poorly when his arms are free to flail about and deeply when they're straight-jacketed to his sides in this contraption.  Also, his dad likes to bottle feed him while swaddled so that baby can't knock the bottle around on accident (bottle feeding from birth was a doctor-approved necessity for us).We put him in this in only his diaper, and he stays warm.-----NEGATIVES------If the house is warm, our baby will sweat in this.  I would not recommend it for very warm climates.  We live in a chilly climate and we keep the house around 68-70 degrees Fahrenheit.  (Our nurse when he was born said that it's better he be a bit over-warm than over-cold.)After multiple washings, the very tip of the velcro flap has begun to curl back a bit, so sometimes it catches on the couch, a blanket, or scratches me.It does pick up lint, especially in the wash if there's lint to be had, and especially in the velcro.",5,1
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn","This SleepSack is great. It swaddles perfectly. As it turns out my son hates to be swaddled, so we'll be giving this away and replacing it with a wearable blanket.The fleece is super soft and warm, perfect for winter nights.The zipper zips down, rather than up, making for really easy diaper changes at all hours while keeping the baby warm.The only downside is the sound the velcro makes opening. Its startling to my son, but honestly the velcro does seem quieter than some I've used, and I don't know how else this would give such a secure swaddle.For reference, my son was born at 9 pounds even and is 20.5 inches long. The newborn size fits him well right now, but would likely need to be replaced with a bigger size in a month or two.",5,1
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn",Ordered this for our newborn preemie granddaughter.  It will serve her for a long time as it is a good size.  Perfect for newborns and especially preemie's who need that extra layer of warmth!,5,1
"Jeep All Weather Umbrella Stroller, Ice Pink","Am very happy with my purchase - Took it to the beach recently - and it worked out nicely, very comfortable - not like a traditional stroller - love the laydown feature so that my baby can take a nap and not have to sit straight up, and love the breathable fabric for HOT DAYS.  It's a little small not wide as my sister was going to get one for her 13 month old boy but she tried him in mine first and it wasn't wide enought but was perfect for my 13 month old.",5,1
Kolcraft Baby Closet Organizer - Blue,"Hi,We purchased this for the nursery and LOVE it.  Our closet is pretty small and this takes up more than half the closet rod, but that doesn't matter because none of the itty bitty outfits need length in the closet.  The side pockets are great for lotions, potions and washcloths.  We found that the Pottery Barn Sabrina baskets fit perfectly into the cubbies to keep things looking tidy.  We even had room to put 2 of the pop up canvas totes above the cubbies (until the clothes get longer) and another long under-the-bed basket underneath.  I thought for sure we'd fill this up fast with clothes but had room for the bottom cubbies to hold toys baby will be able to take out and hopefully put back without help.  People are so amazed at how tidy everything looks- I'm just happy to be able to find something @ 3am when baby is wide awake and I'm lucky to know who I am! :-)Only downside is I packed the organizer with so much stuff I had to replace our closet rod from the wooden one we had to a studier pole, but think of all the things that have a place to go, it's more than worth it.The best purchase we've made for the nursery by far!  We've had it for 6 months and it's still looks brand new.Mom in NY",5,1
Sunshine Kids Easy View Back Seat Mirror,"Love that you can rotate the mirror to many positions to get the write angle. We have been through another type more flashy fun one, but I could not see son's reflection in rear view mirror of my Explorer. This one is perfect!",5,1
"Kushies 6 Pack Wash Cloth Set, White",These wash cloths are perfect!!!  Especially for newborns...but I also use them on my almost 3 year old.  I love that they are thin so they easily get in all the nooks and crannies of a newborn baby.  They are very soft so I feel ok about rubbing this cloth all over my baby's delicate skin.  The inexpensive price is also a huge bonus!!  I also love that these wash cloths wash really well.  I have washed them so many times and they still look like new.I highly recommend these wash cloths!!! *Great to add onto a baby gift!!,5,1
"Colgate Classica I Foam Crib Mattress, White","I am on board with all the positive reviews i saw about this mattress. i was nervous because of SIDS, but i pray alot, so i knew we'd be okay. this mattress is firm, but thats what they recommend for infants. and let me say, baby girl sleeps ALL NIGHT on this thing. its a little hard, but if she loves it, i won't complain.  she snores ever so lightly and i love that sound. this mattress is safe and firm and is just what the doctor ordered for scared new moms like me.  EXCELLENT!!!! the mattress cover and sheets all fit perfectly too by the way. we are very very happy with our purchase and we plan to use it for as long as we can.",5,1
"Colgate Classica I Foam Crib Mattress, White","Fits perfectly in crib, firm but not too hard and very lightweight- Makes changing sheets a breeze! Good product- would definitely recommend to others",5,1
Uncle Goose Classic Embossed Alphabet Blocks ABC,"This was a birthday gift to our 1 year old granddaughter. The size of the blocks are perfect, She loves the colors and is quickly learning to stack the blocks. We'll help her learn the alphabet when she's a little older. Her mom and dad also love the blocks and can't help but toss them at each other from across the living room, calling out the letters. Of course, they don't let their young-one watch them toss the blocks, they're responsible parents.",5,1
Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair - Tan,"We love this highchair! Not only was it less expensive than the others out there, it fits perfectly on our kitchen chairs and doesn't take up much space. We have even taken it to hotels when we travel for a chair for our daughter (who is three months old) to be in while we get ready. This is the best highchair and it converts to a booster so it will grow with her.",5,1
Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,"My 4 month old daughter loves this.  It's also perfect because we can take it outside. While our older children play in the backyard, she can play in the jumper.",4,1
Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,"My son just loves this! We have always had the ones that attach to a doorway, but our new home had no place to hang one, so this is perfect. He would spend so much time jumping up and down, and even side ways. The higher he jumped, the more he laughed. The legs kind of fold together so you can fit it through narrow doorways if you need to move it from room to room, which I did. It's a little awkward trying to carry it, but not too bad. I like the height adjustment too. He has been able to use this for a long time (he is 10 months now). We have a new baby cousin waiting for her turn to use it!",5,1
"PRIMO Folding Potty with Handles, White granite","My daughters just got potty trained and I did not want to lug two potty chairs around, so when I saw this I thought perfect. I do not think it is at all flimsy. Granted, you do need to hold your child while they are on it because it is smaller then most potty's but heck, you can fold it up and carry it around with you so who cares? I would recommend.",5,1
PRIMO Infant Bath Seat (White),"We've been using this seat for my baby since the day she came home from the hospital.  She has been delayed in sitting, so we're still using it at 11.5 months. she's 28&#34; and 20# and she fits in it just fine. It worked great in my small kitchen sink when she was very young, and now we use it in a simple baby tub, in our regular bathtub.  i've never thought that she looked uncomfortable on the plastic seat, and the position she's in is perfect. Now that she's sitting well on her own, i still start bath time using the seat because it's so much easier to wash her hair in this position. this is well, well worth the price.  so much easier than the more $$ fussier infant tubs/seats.",5,1
Primo 4-In-1 Soft Seat Toilet Trainer and Step Stool White with Pastel Blue Seat,"I love this thing* the baby can open it and sit* I or baby can remove the seat and put on a real toilette (or bring along). seat size is perfect, and stable enough on the potty.  handles are great* when closed, it's a step stool she can use to wash her hands* it comes with a potty training guide and 'success' stickers. she loves the kangaroo, her first one.* very light* seat cushion is comfortable and easy to cleancleaning* I just take out the receptacle, empty it, wipe it down, and lysol it.  easy peasyonly con is that the blue rubber cushion on the seat can be pulled off if you're having a tug of war with the baby who wants to pick it up, and you want it to stay put. but then I can put it back (has tabs)possible con is that it's so light that she can move it around if it's not on carpeting (and I prefer nothing under it).  when she moves it, she might back into something, causing the lid to fall on her. I removed the lid for a bit, but then she couldn't use it as a stepstool, so I put it back.",5,1
Primo 4-In-1 Soft Seat Toilet Trainer and Step Stool White with Pastel Blue Seat,"We've had this potty for a month now, and could not be happier. We originally had a seat that went right on the toilet, but because it hinders my toddler's independence (by not being able to get on himself) it was a dud. I was worried about some of the other potty seats because of reviews suggesting they would not accomodate a bigger/older child.This seat is perfect! Since the chair came (via FAST SHIPPING), my son has used the seat every single day at least once and sometimes more. He'll sit on there for quite awhile with a book and no red marks on his chunky thighs. It's great that his feet touch the floor, too. He especially loves the step stool, but I would not reccommend showing your child this feature unless you want them moving ""the stool"" around themselves. As far as cleaning goes, I don't imagine anything would be easier. Great seat. Very pleased. Glad we passed up on the brand I actually prefer (Bjorn).Oh and did I mention my son is only 21 months??",5,1

Philips AVENT Thermal Tote Navy,"I bought this bag because i needed to take a lot of baby stuff with, and it is perfect.",5,1
Quick Clean Breastpump Accessory Wipes 24 Pack,"These wipes are perfect if you're a working mother that wants to continue to nurse. It's inconvenient to water wash your pump parts at work after each use, so even if you have the option to do so, these wipes are a much better and faster solution. They are large enough to clean all parts after each use, are odorless, and leave no milk residue on your pump parts. I've been using them for six months now and love them.",5,1
Tupperware Shape O Ball Toy,"This is a &#34;tactile learning toy&#34; that my children played with over 40 years ago.  My daughter specifically requested the Shape-O Ball for her daughter, who is only 7 months old, but is getting acquainted with it now.The primary colors are vivid and eye-catching.The shapes are too big to swallow, and have no sharp edges, and they each fit only in the specific opening.It doesn't talk, does not require batteries, and is very durable--a nearly perfect toy!",5,1
"JJ Cole Lite Embroidered Bundleme, Powder, Infant","A very practical solution, i use it for my Graco stroller, of course it won't perfectly fit it, but i don't have to search for blanket on the floor anymore.",4,1
"Munchkin Deluxe Potty Seat, Colors May Vary","My son is very particular about which potty he will use.  This is the only one he will use on the big toilet.  The handles are awesome and it fits perfectly.  Very stable.As for deflectors, we had problems with the potty chairs that sat on the floor and had a deflector.  We simply taught him to point before peeing and we have no mess.  While learning, I simply kept a thing of disinfecting wipes handy to clean up and removed the rugs from the bathroom.Of course, I'm really looking forward to the day when I don't need one of these.  But until then, this is the one for my house.",5,1
"green sprouts 10 Pack Waterproof Absorbent Terry Bibs , Boys",These bibs are fantastic for my 3-month old. They really are waterproof without compromising absorbancy. They're perfect for protecting my little one's clothes from spit-up stains right after a big bottle. I HIGHLY recommend these!,5,1
"BABYBJORN Spoon 2 Pack, Red/Blue","The spoons are cute and very functional. My baby was 6 months old when we started feeding her purees, and this spoon is perfect. It's round and has no edge that could possibly hurt her, even when she's playing instead of eating her food. The tip is made of soft but sturdy plastic and is very gentle on her gums, but not so soft that I would worry her biting into it. Also, the eyes on the spoon proves to be a great entertainment for babies - my daughter would stare at them at times with a funny face. The novelty has since worn off, but she still loves her spoons. And so do I.",5,1
"Regalo My Chair Portable Chair, Royal","This chair was a big hit with my 14 month old daughter.She loves this chair! So i am really happy that i bought it.Its very light to carry around and comfy for my baby to sit on while playing or reading books.It would have been helpful if it had more height, but otherwise its perfect!Just be careful that it has a backstrap cause the one i ordered didnt and then amazon sent me another one which had a back strap.",4,1
Basic Comfort Contoured Changing Pad by Summer Infant,"We use this for naps as well.  I've bought 2 so far.  Great, safe place for him to sleep.  We bought a little co-sleeper mini-bed to put in our bed, but he'll outgrow it in about a month.  This feels very safe and is perfectly comfortable for him as well.",5,1
Basic Comfort Contoured Changing Pad by Summer Infant,"Need to figure a way to 'create' another changing table for baby? This is perfect. My sister used it on a side board like piece of furniture and it was just right. It has just enough of a curved shape to keep rollicking baby ON the surface. It is plastic covered for easy cleaning (though we covered it with nursing blanket and table pads for easier cleaning...nonetheless, it's a smart buy. Think about one for your kitchen counter, or keep one in trunk for when you visit friends since it can also be a nice bedding alternative so little one on-the-road isn't stuck at visits staying seated in their car seat (not good for your little ones!) I don't recommend using the buckle... Unless the chld is at rolling over stage. But make sure you secure the cushion on furniture with either some jimmied tie down or rug padding (rubbery clingy stuff) between the piece and your furniture!",5,1
Kiddopotamus Duomat 2 in 1 Car Seat Protector Mat,"Feels durable, fits perfectly between the LATCH anchors in my car, and eliminated the little divots that were being left in my leather seats by the carseat base.  For the price I can't think of anything to complain about!",5,1
"Kiddopotamus CozyUp Carrier Cover, Navy &amp; Ivory","This product is great for the coming winter months. It allows the baby to see, but still keeps them toasty warm when it is cold outside or in the car. My son did not like me tossing a blanket over him when we would go out to the car when it was raining or really cold, so this was a perfect item. He could see, and stay dry at the same time.",5,1
"Munchkin Deluxe Bottle Brush, Colors May Vary",It stays clean and stays upright doesnt get funky and cleans bottles perfectly. Great Product and price. Worth every penny,5,1
Evenflo SimpleStep Pressure Gate Taupe,it works perfect at the end of the stairs to keep the dogs from going upstairs.  The walk though door is perfect. The only thing that was a little difficult was tring to put it together without looking at the instructions. After reading the instructions it went together easy. All and all it is a great product.,5,1
Upspring Baby Walking Wings Learning To Walk Assistant Blue,"Our 12 month old daughter could walk perfectly fine as long as she was touching our fingers, but we couldn't get her to take the plunge and just try it on her own.  We bought this, put it on her and within ONE HOUR she was walking on her own.  Within one day she was running around our house and climbing on everything.  For us it wasn't needed to teach her to walk, it was needed for giving her the confidence to do it on her own.  As soon as she saw she could use her arms to balance and that she didn't have to hold our fingers, she caught on immediately.We didn't try this earlier, and most of the negative reviews here seems to be with really young kids.  I've heard of the same thing we used this for being done with something like wooden dowels, but we wanted something we could grab her if needed.  (For wooden dowels, I've heard you have the kid grab them, thinking they're your fingers, then just let go of them and the kid will think you're still there until they learn they didn't need you.  No idea how great it works, just something I heard)",5,1
"Burlington Baby Cherry Willow Hamper with Liner, Pink","This hamper is big,looks great and is sturdy as said before.I got 2 one for my baby's bathroom and one for his nursery.They both came in time and in perfect condition.",5,1
Mother's Milkmate Breast Milk Storage Rack (10 Bottles),"I was so sick of trying to keep track of which breast milk bottle was the oldest when trying to feed our son. When I went back to work, this product helped me keep tract of which milk was the oldest and needed to be used first without having to write a date on every single bottle. Plus with the storage rack it fit very nicely in our fridge without taking up a ton of space. The bottles have never leaked, which I was skeptical considering they lay on their side. I loved on it attached perfectly to my Medela Breast Pump. I have recommended this product to all of my breastfeeding friends.",5,1
"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, White",My parents have 2 cats which they do not allow in the living room of their home do to delicate collectables. They where using boxes stacked up in the doorway which did not have a nice appearance nor allowed air to circulate into the room. I installed the gate in 15 minutes. I ordered the extra tall gate to discourage the cats from jumping over it. The extra height also makes it easeir to open the gate without bending over. It works perfectly.,5,1
Diaper Dude Chicago Cubs Diaper Bag,This bag was purchased as a birthday gift for my oldest son. He is in the Air National Guard as well as a not so new dad of a beautiful baby girl.(His 5th child) The camouflage is perfect for a military guy. The features inside were a great surprise. Everything you need for the little one is there including a chaging pad. Quite roomy and adequate.,5,1
Bumkins Waterproof Art Smock - Dr. Seuss Cat In The Hat,I purchased this for my 2 yr old granddaughter who loves to finger paint. I Love the long sleeves with firm - but not tight- elastic at the end to prevent paint from ending up all over her arms.  The pocket in front is perfect for markers or  paint brushes!,5,1
"Bumkins Junior Bib, Blue Fizz",We finally figured out to buy this Junior size bib for my son when he was 18 months old.  We had been using the smaller ones and we would have to change his pants after every meal.  I wish we had bought these sooner!  These are perfect for toddlers and are the only bibs we need now.,5,1
Lambs &amp; Ivy Rhyme Tyme Picture Frame 4''x4'',"very cute frame. went perfect with our theme. no surprises,what you see is what you get.",5,1
Kids Line Leap Froggie Switch Plate Cover,I love this. I was looking for a switch plate cover to match our nursery bedding for our new arrival due in August and this matches perfectly and is so well made! We love it!,5,1
Kidsline Camelot Night Light,"This is a beautiful night light.  We have the Camelot nursery and of course this is perfect, but I would use this in other rooms too.  Even a child's bathroom would be nice.  It is just very pleasant to look at and when children see stuff like this, it helps them not to be afraid of the dark.  On or off, this is beautiful.",5,1
"Dreambaby Pressure Mount Hallway Gate with Extensions, Black","This gate is the best!  I needed to block off a wide entrace so my yorkies could not get to my cats litter box.  I did not want an ugly wooden type.  This gate is perfect!  Easy to install, no holes in the wall are needed and the gate is easily opened with one hand.  It is so sturdy that my cats go over the top and the gate has never let me down.  I would never think twice about recommending this gate.  NA",5,1
Evenflo Madison Playard Complete Nursery,"We've had this playard since my daughter was born.  She's almost 3.  I used it SOLELY as her bassinet at work and then her playpen at work for almost two years.  There was NEVER any problem with the locking mechanism.  It's about being able to read the instructions.  If you lock the sides and THEN push the center down, you have no problem.  People who don't understand how a modern playard work are the ones with the problem.  She LOVED this playard, especially the little stuffed bear mobile.Because I own my own business, my space for my daughter's nap area was very limited.  This fit perfectly and functioned perfectly.  I love the nightlight and music box feature.  It lulled her to sleep every day for almost 1-1/2 years.It's very portable, and I love the wheels on the end.  I really REALLY loved the diaper changing station that easily removes.  That was a Godsend.  I didn't have to buy a changing table for my already limited space at work.I don't know why there are any negative reviews.  If you read the directions and lock the sides FIRST then push the center down, there is absolutely no way the sides can come undown.  It's simple physics.  I absolutely 100% endorse this product.  You will love it.The dark red color is great for a boy or girl.  It's gender-neutral!",5,1
Skip Hop Expo - Canvas-Blue Camo,"This bag is the best there is.  I use cloth diapers so I need the extra 7-inch expansion, and it's just enough room to fit everything.  There is a ton of pockets and compartments, which I like because I organize things compulsively.  The only problem with the bag is that it's really too small to use as an overnight bag.  It's absolutely perfect for day trips and around town.  Everyone I know has this bag or a similar Skip Hop.",4,1
"Leachco Snoogle Loop Contoured Fit Body Pillow, Ivory","I bought this for my wife (we are expecting) and she loves it! She's 17weeks and was already starting to experience sleepless nights until this pillow. She's 5'4'' and fits perfect. Supports her whole body and eliminated 3 pillows she was using for support. Now more room for the dog and I haha. If you're looking in to this pillow, please get it! It is definitly worth every penny. Make sure you purchase the cover because it is not included.",5,1
Safety 1st Sound 'n Lights Activity Walker,"I purchased this item for my 6 month grand-nephew.  I thought he might be a bit too young for this, but it was just perfect!  I am amazed how much he loves to play with the little activity toys.  The nursery rhymes are delightful and there are many.  The toy piece easily comes off when you want to feed the child.  It is very apparent this item was carefully tested.  We just love it!!!!  I highly recommend this item.",5,1
"Stork Craft Aspen 3 Drawer Chest, Cherry","I purchased this as part of my new grandbaby's nursery set, I also purchased the matching changing table/dresser and the Rochester crib (which matches perfectly).  The nursery is beautiful and all this furniture is high quality and will last from baby to teen!  Highly recommended!",5,1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,Very soft and the ribbing on the blanket is lovely.  The new arrival should enjoy this treat.  It arrived on time in perfect condition.,5,1
"Chicco Capri Lightweight Stroller, Tangerine",Perfect. A little bigger than your average umbrella and it has the shoulder straps for the little ones. I also like that it lays back a bit verses staying so erect like other smaller stroller.  Very nice quality. ..I would highly recommend.,5,1
"Chicco Capri Lightweight Stroller, Tangerine","We purchased this stroller for use as an umbrella stroller instead of buying the super cheap ones. We like the Chicco brand. It is very smooth and we like the added features of the sun shade and the goodie basket. I will agree with other users that sometimes my husband kicks the rear wheels and the strap between the child's legs should be longer. However this fits our needs perfectly. We wanted something small, compact, light for our 2 year old in malls and other brief trips. It is very compact and light weight. If you want a full on stroller that has an adjustable handles, cup holders, all terrain wheels I highly recommend the Chicco Cortina Travel System. We loved ours and still use it for the zoo or the fair.",4,1
"Chicco Capri Lightweight Stroller, Tangerine","We bought this stroller for a recent trip to Cancun and it was just perfect!  We didn't want to bring anything expensive that could get damaged or lost but we wanted something nicer than just a cheap-o umbrella stroller. It is so easy to collapse and unfold, maneuvers great, is very lightweight, reclines slightly, is comfortable for baby, looks good and even comes with a little travel bag.  My baby seems very comfortable in this stroller.  He fell asleep in it a few time on our trip and has since on our evening walks and he has never fallen asleep in his big travel system stroller.  I was able to recline the seat with him still in it without waking him up or bring it back up.  It doesn't lay all the way down (probably reclines about 3 or 4 inches) but it is perfectly comfy for a little snooze.  It is so easy to use that I have started using it around town for errands and quick trips.I was worried about some of the reviews of people staying their feet kicked the wheels or that it is too short.  Honestly, I haven't had either of those problems.  I am 5 ft 9 and my husband is 5 ft 10 and we are both comfortable pushing it.  This isn't a stroller meant for a ten mile walk but it does it exactly what it is designed for.Other things I like are that I can hang a full sized diaper bag on the handles and it stays there and doesn't cause the stroller to tip or anything.  The brakes work well and it has a small basket underneath.  The basket is not huge but it isn't supposed to be.  You can fit a small purse, a couple of water bottles and a jacket under there.  The only con for me was that I pinched my fingers in the seat buckles a couple of times until I got used to it.  However, the buckles are very secure and covered so that baby can't get at them.  Overall, I would highly recommend this stroller.",5,1
The First Years Take and Toss 28-Piece Feeding Variety Pack,"I got this kit as a gift at my baby shower, and thought it was great, but didn't think I'd use them until she was well established with solids.  I was wrong.  My daughter is just shy of 5 months and I've been using them for the last 3 months.  We spend a lot of time visiting my parents and the larger size bowls/lids are perfect for taking along extra formula without taking the whole container of it for a day or overnight trip.  I just washed and kept a couple of scoopers that come with the formula and they fit perfectly into the larger containers.  Also, we've just begun rice ceral, so I use the smaller containers for taking that along, also.  I've even used it to take things like salad dressing to work for lunch!  The sizes are really perfect for small portions. There are so many great pieces for such a great price, and even though I haven't used the utensils, I still love this set of ""baby-sized tupperware.""  I would give it 5 stars even if the utensils were missing.",5,1
"Bumkins Waterproof Superbib, Blue Fizz",This is the perfect size bibs for messy meals! I wouldn't recommend it as a wear all day type bib but a strictly for meal type bib.,5,1
"Badger Basket Two Hamper Set with Liners, Natural","I needed a garbage can in the kitchen that would look nice sitting out. I could have gotten the wood one and paid 2 to 3 times as much for one! I have a regular kitchen can inside the larger basket for the kitchen. The prior reviews about it being cheaply made are not accurate. These are baskets, and as such not like iron, but it is a sturdy basket with a nice lid! Perfect for my needs!",5,1
"Pearhead Wood Bank, Memorybox White","Perfect for holding keepsakes for baby.  We bought this for a memorial box for our deceased daughter.The foam stuff for the footprints did not take and hold the imprint, but we used inked footprints and that worked just as well.  It's a special and beautiful holding place for special things - the outfit she wore in the hospital, an unused preemie sized diaper, tiny booties, cards and letters from friends and family, and pictures and letters from our other children for their baby sister.  This was the perfect size to hold what we wanted to put in it, and is a special place for our family to help through the grieving process of our beloved daughter and sister...",5,1
"DaVinci Kalani 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","I am very pleased with this crib! It is beautiful and extremely sturdy, as others have said.  It also matches the other DaVinci products perfectly.  My son and daughter are now sharing a room since we have baby #3 on the way.  He has the DaVinci Elizabeth toddler bed in cherry and these two pieces go well in the room together.  I will say that my son's bed has a few indentions and digs after a year and a half but no major scratches.  It took my husband a little bit longer than expected to assemble (he is typically very quick w/ these types of things).  And one of pieces of hardware was stripped so we had to find a replacement at Lowe's.  I would still recommend this crib to anyone.  It has a very commanding presence when you walk in the room and looks much more expensive than it was.",5,1
"DaVinci Kalani 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","Like most new moms, I spent weeks reading crib reviews. It gave me such a headache and I found that a lot of people are a lot more nit-picky than I am. Let me say first that shipping shouldn't be go into a product review, but our shipping was fast and the crib came packaged well and with no damaged or missing pieces. The package is very heavy so have some strong men available to move it. My husband was able to put the crib together basically by himself in about an hour and a half. He ran into one issue with one of the locking bolts but he is a mechanic and was able to fix it (I'm not sure what he did to fix it). A lot of people were talking about how soft the wood is but we didn't scratch or nick the crib at all during assembly. We bought the crib in Ebony, which looks perfect with the decor of the nursery. We bought the Simmons Kids Beautyrest Beginnings Sleepy Whispers Ultra Deluxe 2 n 1 Crib and Toddler Mattress to go with this crib and it is  PERFECT fit. It is very snug and has no gaps whatsoever. I am very pleased with this crib and would recommend to a friend.",5,1
DaVinci Alpha Mini Rocking Crib - Natural,I bought this for my new  great granddaughter when she is w/me. It is just the right size and doesn't take up much room. Love that it rocks while she is little and can put the casters on when she is more active. I think it's perfect.,5,1
DaVinci Alpha Mini Rocking Crib - Natural,"We got a mini crib to fit our one bedroom apartment, and are so glad we did!  We were hoping this crib would accommodate the little man until we change over to a toddler bed, and from looking at it, I feel pretty confident it should fit him just fine.  I read lots of reviews on what mattresses and sheets would fit the crib, and I tried some things that others had advised didn't fit quite properly, but i am pleased to say everything we received fits like a glove!For the Mattress we got the  Dream On Me 3&#34; Portable Crib Mattress.- It couldn't fit any better. No gaps or anything.  The &#34;pad&#34; that comes with the crib is horrible, thin and very squishy, not at all firm. Definitely buy a separate mattress if your using this crib as the baby's primary sleeping spot!For the Sheets we got American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheet -- these fit the 3&#34; mattress perfectly (after being washed and dried), I will advise that it is a snug fit and I don't see how they would fit a thicker mattress like a 50 coil, etc.We also got the American Baby Company Waterproof fitted Quilted Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover.The crib itself is beautiful, we got it in the Natural colour.  The rocking setting is Awesome.  It also has rubber covers along the rail of the crib for when the tike starts to gnaw.",5,1
DaVinci Alpha Mini Rocking Crib - Natural,"perfect size for our small roomdon't know why you need to put so many words in this, but I don't have anything else to say.",5,1
DaVinci Alpha Mini Rocking Crib - Natural,"I wanted a crib that would go through a narrow doorway as needed.  The approximate 39""L x 26""W finished size is just perfect, and it is beautiful to boot!  This is for my grandchild(ren), but it would have worked for my children as well -- once they reached 50 pounds there was no keeping them in a crib!  The only tricky part is crib sheets that will fit the smaller mattress-- I am currently using a cotton jersey pillowcase. UPDATE -- Actually I found the sheets on Amazon a few days later.",5,1
DaVinci Alpha Mini Rocking Crib - Natural,"Baby is not here yet, so haven't tested it with the baby. Installed it myself in about an hour. Came with a 4 page manual, but the instructions for installing the crib was on one page. Read other reviews about the flimsy mattress that came with this crib, so I bought theDream On Me 3"" Spring Coil Portable Crib Mattress, White. Fits perfectly.  Now have to go by many sheets and a waterproof mattress pad.Crib is light.  Like that it had wheels.  If you don't want wheels, just take them off, and the crib becomes a ""rocker.""I do see a potential major weakness: the mattress support board.  It is a piece of thin, maybe 1/4"" MDF board, surrounded or enclosed by 4 pieces of pine wood. There's another piece of wood (2 inch X 15 inch) going across the board, acting as a brace.  If for whatever reason your child jumps up and down on the board, I think either the board will snap, crack or pop. Something to consider. I've attached images.",4,1
DaVinci Sleigh Toddler Bed - Honey Oak,"Bed was somewhat easy to assemble.  It took about 1 hour by myself.  The slats were the most difficult to assemble, would be much easier if you had 2 to align them.  Bed looks great.I don't like that the bed is rated to only 50 lbs.  That part was disappointing since I want to be able to sit on it with my child.  My husband (165 lbs) did lay on it before I could tell him not to and it didn't break, so I guess that is good but since it is rated only to 50 lbs, he won't be doing that again!The standard crib mattress that I purchased fit perfectly.  The flat sheet and comforter are hard to tuck in since you have the rails.  My 20 month old can easily climb on the mattress by himself.  He hasn't fallen out of it because I haven't had him try to sleep in it yet, still getting his big boy room ready.",4,1
DaVinci Sleigh Toddler Bed - Honey Oak,"Bed came well packaged (box is heavy).  Espresso color is beautiful, bed is made of quality durable products. There were a few &#34;nicks&#34; on a couple of the pieces the mattress rests on, but since they will be covered, I didn't mind.  Easy enough for one adult and a very helpful two year old to assemble in a half hour or so (although a second set of hands would have made it even faster/easier).  Our existing crib mattress fit PERFEs very durable!  Our existing crib mattress fit PERFECT.",5,1
"DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry",I love everything about this crib! The wood coloring is perfect and the Length and height are great! I look forward to changing it to a toddler bed and then into a twin size in the futrue.,5,1
"DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","This is a very substantial crib. Somewhat challenging lining up the barrel nuts with the bolts on an angle but once it is together, it is a very good crib.  It does scratch somewhat during assembly, but my wife applied Old English scratch remover and that took care of the scratches.  We bought a crib mattress at a local home center and it fit perfectly.  My wife and I are very happy with the crib and my son has never slept so well.",5,1
"DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","We bought this to replace the recalled crib we have been using for 20 months. Install was easy but could be easier. There were certain angles of the screws that had to be perfectly aligned. It wasn't as forgiving as I wanted. Overall, install was good. You need two people to help at certain steps. Product is solid. My 20 month kid can no longer shake it or jump on it like a springboard. No worries of it breaking apart either. I have it set t the lowest point and he can definitely climb it if he wanted to. I've got a climber. I am 5'9"" and I can change the diaper and reach the bottom without a problem. The crib is beautiful. It looks really nice and does not look cheap. Cherry color is great. I am happy with this so I plan on buying the changer that comes with a drawer. Would really compliment this crib in his room. Need drawers also.",5,1
"DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","I was looking for a white crib and fell in love with this one. Was so much better than expected although I was reluctant at first given the price compared to other cribs on the market.  Don't waste your money, this crib is perfect! Believe me I browsed around for weeks before deciding and I am truly happy I purchased this model. Perfect size and all. Will definitely recommend it.",5,1
"DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","This crib came within days of ordering it.  It arrived in perfect condition, and was easy to assemble.  The color of the wood is beautiful and matches other items I have purchased for the same room.  We purchased a mattress prior to buying this crib and were pleasantly surprised that it fit perfectly.  Other reviews stated that the mattress (if purchased elsewhere/different manufacturer) may not fit properly, but we had no problems.  Baby has arrived, and is sleeping well in this well-made crib.  I would definitely recommend this crib to others interested in purchasing it.",5,1
DaVinci Emily Mini Crib - White,It was super easy for my husband to put up by himself (He insisted) and it is a beautiful crib. Perfect size to put in our small space but good enough to last awhile. Only thing is I wish it was alittle darker but still nice enough to get a 5 star.,5,1
"DaVinci Emily 3-Drawer Changer Dresser, Ebony","I have spent the last couple months looking for the ""perfect"" changing table and I finally decided on this one.  I made this decision since I did already purchase the Davinci Emily crib and have been happy.  I am also happy that Davinci also markets itself as lead and phthalate free.  The changing table looks nice.  Almost all changing tables for this price range have composite so I was prepared for that.  I think it is a great value if you are looking in the $200 - $300 price range.  My one frustration was that the manufacturer gave us the wrong pieces for one of the drawers.  However, I was really happy that within 24 hours of emailing the company they responded and said they will be shipping out the correct part and would be arriving in 7 - 10 business days.  So I have been happy with their customer service as well.",4,1
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","Our first son was born in 2007 and we found this product after a few weeks.  He was a big baby and very strong so we had trouble with every other swaddler because he could get out of it.  Once we bought this miracle blanket he could not get out of it and he was able to sleep through the night (12am-6am) at 8 weeks old.  From that point and until he was around 4 months old all sleep time was in the swaddler.  As he got older and stronger we actually had to wrap two of these around him and it was still perfect.  The fabric is such a lightweight cotton that he didn't get too hot.  We would put him in his diaper only and then wrap each blanket around him.  We are also using this blanket for our second son, who slept through the night the first night we tried the miracle blanket!  If you are deciding which swaddle blanket to buy, LOOK NO FURTHER!  YOU MUST BUY THIS BLANKET!",5,1
"Under The Nile Bunny Blanket Friend, Blue","Perfect, exactly as described and NOT made in China! I love how soft it is and my baby loves it, which is always a plus.",5,1
Under The Nile Green Bean Toy,My 4 month old loves his green bean toy.  It is the perfect size for his little hands and he likes cooing at the little face.  I love that it is a toy I know he can play with safely and I don't necessarily have to keep an eye on him when he has it.  It is also something he can play with for years.  I can't wait to buy the rest of them and see if he loves them as much as this pne.,5,1
"Summer Infant Secure Surround Play Safe Play Yard, Tan","Very affordable gate.  We got it for our new puppy, and it works great!  I love how it's so big and can be opened up so it can block off half the room or closed together like an enclosed play yard.  This was perfect for us and our puppy.  Color is nice and neutral.",5,1
"Summer Infant Secure Surround Play Safe Play Yard, Tan","I bought this gate a couple months ago. My son was not yet crawling, but he could scooch himself wherever he needed to go. It was perfect for keeping him in one place with all his toys, and away from the tables and plants that he was wanting to get into.However, as he got older, and learned to crawl and get around more quickly, I felt bad sticking him in here. There really isn't much room to move around (I can't even imagine putting TWO children in this). I ordered the two panel extension, but never received it (they canceled my order...argh!). Having to improvise, I used my couch as a natural barrier on one side, and attached each end of the gate to each end of my couch. It gave him TONS of room! Now he can crawl all over the living room without getting into anything, and the gate's sturdy enough that he can't move it or knock it over. It's a HUGE help!",4,1
"Summer Infant All-in-One Potty Seat and Step Stool, Blue","This potty is perfectly adequate for most kids, but since my 17 month daughter is quite small, it is a bit too big for her to use comfortably.  However, it's a decent potty that we'll keep around as a backup as she gets bigger.",4,1
"Fantasy Furniture Homey VIP Sofa, Sweet Brown","I purchased this sofa for my 2 year old son to sit on while he watches movies.I guess I'd first like to address some of the negative comments I'm seeing in regards to adults/teenagers/pets not being happy with this sofa. It says specifically in the item description:""It is a real piece of furniture, upholstered with soft Twill fabric to give your Kids a comfortable place to read and play.""The key word in that statement is kids. I guess Amazon could put the word ""kids"" or ""toddler"" in the main description, but if you're planning to buy this couch, I would assume you read the description of what it is.That being said, my child loves this sofa. He props his Buzz Lightyear on one side and he sits on the other for some marathon Toy Story watching.Pros:--  Size. It's a perfect fit for my son and a toy/stuffed animal/blanket/pillow/etc. Don't confuse this with a full size couch. It isn't something that he and some friends could share, but if you had 2 younger(smaller) children I don't think there would be a problem with them fitting comfortably.--  Quality.  Although this couch won't be confused with top of the line, amish made furniture, it is decently made. The color was a tad off from the picture but it works just fine. The fabric is soft and isn't too terribly difficult to clean up small spills.  The little pillows are a decorative touch, but my son chooses to use his own.--  Price. I picked this up for under a hundred bucks. We couldn't find anything close to that price in our local stores.Cons:-  None yet. I could see the fabric being an issue to some, but to knock this because your 20 year old doesn't fit on it is plain silly.If you're looking for a cheap sofa for your kids to use exclusively, this is it. It's inexpensive enough there you won't mind it taking the abuses of a little one, but it will keep the adult furniture safe.",4,1
Munchkin Travelware Disposable Bibs - 24 Pack,We take these with us everywhere. They are perfect for the restaurants. Just use and toss. Simple and worth the price. And just do you know sizing our daughter is 2 and a half and these fit her just fine.,5,1
"LA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 32&quot;, White","I initially was against pad covers because it was so much easier to wipe down the pad after accidents, or escaped lotion, creams etcs. A cover needs to be washed all the time, after every little tinke accident or worse. Loved this pad for comfort factor and wipe down factor and size. Ended up getting a cover because the outer layer cracks pretty badly and rips after continuous use - everyday since little one was born until 9 months. I picked up a fairly cheap terry one from target not perfect fit but does the job. Will be getting a second one for new baby nursery.",4,1
"LA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 32&quot;, White",It is the perfect size. It has a strap (although I don't use it) and it fits all of the standard covers.,5,1
JP Lizzy Chocolate Ice Classic Tote Set,"This diaper bag is super cute and just the right size.  It has an open top, which is not that bad--it was the reason I hesitated buying it because I thought everything would fall out.  Not so.  There are a lot of pockets and holders within the bag, and side pockets too (perfect for your cell and keys).  The peripherals are kinds of unnecessary to use with the diaper bag (wristlet and makeup bag looking case) but I'm using them ""out"" of the bag, in my briefcase and suitcase.I get tons of compliments on this bag.  As a FTM I spent tons of time researching diaper bags and chose this over a Bumble Bag.",5,1
"Elegant Baby 8 Piece Bath Squirties Gift Set in Vinyl Zip Bag, Sea",I added these to my daughters wish list thinking they would be the perfect size for her to carry around and I was right! They come in a cute bag that my daughter likes to play with almost more than the animals. Good quality and cute colors. Defiantly a good buy.,5,1
Bumble Bags Infant Seat Cover-Pink Latte,"I bought this to put over my existing car seat cover which is 5 years old and, quite frankly, not that attractive.  I could not be any more thrilled than I am with it!!  It fits perfectly over the exicting cover and is cute as a button.  Two thumbs WAY UP!!",5,1
Elegant Baby Microfiber Blanket 36&quot; X 45&quot; Green,"I got this for a great price, and it's a perfect size and very soft!",5,1
Bumble Bags Kimberly Messenger Backpack Pink Paisley,I've gone through about 30 diaper bags in the past year and this is one of my favorites.  the material is great in that I can carry it on a rainy day or to the playground and not worry about it getting ruined.  I love that it has a zipper top rather then a messenger flap because I find it to be easier access.  the side pocket is perfect for my bottle of water and inside there are plently of pockets for my stuff for me and my toddler.  The strap is comfortable to wear and Ican wear it across my body or over my shoulder.  My only recommendation would be to make it an adjustable strap and to have the inside be a lighter color rather then black because of the ""black-hole"" effect.,5,1
"Munchkin Two Snack Catchers, Colors May Vary",Perfect for little hands.It offers no mess while our little one has their snack @ home or on the go.  It also allows motor skill development when they try to put their hands inside the cup and pick up their snacks.It didn't take my Daughter long to figure out how things worked.Durable and easy to clean.,5,1
"Gerber Graduate BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips Spill Proof Cup, 7 Ounce, Colors May Vary","I have tried several brands and these nuk beakers are my favourite by far. They are truly spill proof even when shaken. I love that they are so simple, there are no fiddly parts so they are easy to clean and you don't spend an hour tracking down all the parts like i have done with others. They are perfect for my now 18 month old who has been using them since she was about 12 months. Easy for her to hold, even in one hand. They are also good value and have lasted very well.",5,1
"Stork Craft Rocking Horse, Oak","We ordered the oak finish rocking horse and it arrived quickly. Assembly was very easy as the only tool needed was a ""Phillips"" screwdriver. It took me less than 10 minutes to assemble. All the pieces arrived complete and in tact.The oak finish is an attractive compliment to our furniture.  The brown yarn used for the mane & tail is stapled on so I can see it coming off after being tugged on a while. It should be easy enough to reattach with a heavy duty staple gun, or maybe with a few decorative brass screw like I'm thinking of doing anyway.The size of the horse is perfect for our 19 month old who is about 33"" tall and 25 lbs. I was also surprised at how solid and sturdy it felt once assembled. I'm about 215 lbs and it feels like it could support my weight if I carefully sat on it.. although I'm not about to try it. I would say this horse could *easily* support a 60-70 lb child. The reason it's so sturdy, is because they inserted threaded brass sleeves into the wooden pieces, in which the brass screws can thread into. This provides a metal on metal point of contact rather than metal on wood. Thus eliminating weak spots at the load bearing points.We paid less than $50 for the product. Our daughter loves it. It looks nice in the home. She should get a couple years use out of it unless she keeps ""shooting"" upward like summer corn.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is because it doesn't seem to rock quite as good as some of the spring mounted horses we looked at. I think this style is a bit safer for a toddler so it's a tradeoff.Thanks for reading.",4,1
Todays Tot Austin Toddler Bed - Oak,Todays Tot Austin Toddler Bed Finish: OakMy Grandson is only 13 mos. old but won't sleep in the porta-crib at Grandma & Grandpa's so we redid his room in a BIG BOY Safari Theme and the bed was relatively easy to assemble and my Grandson can in and out of the bed on his own.  A perfect choice at a perfect price.,5,1
Starlight Support Mattress - Cradle Mattress,"Our baby girl slept on this mattress every night for the first three months of her life.  While it is not terribly thick, it is firm and supportive and with the addition of a mattress pad appeared to be quite comfortable. It fit our hand-me-down cradle perfectly.",4,1
Skip Hop Duo Double - Canvas-Charcoal,"I bought this diaper bag a month ago after using the trendy Fleurville for 2 years. I just had another baby and it's perfect because my older one is still in diapers. I tend to carry too much stuff. Everything fits in this bag. There is an outside compartment for keys, wallet, lipstick, etc. There is no digging through the bag to find what you want. I simply love it and highly recommend it.",5,1
"SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket, Brown Polka Dots, Pastel Blue",I love the cotton flannel blend of this blanket.  Works perfectly with baby in a onesie for sleeping.  Generous fabric makes for the most ideal swaddling.  Washes well too!  Also love the pink and brown colors!,5,1
SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket- Polka Dots - Fushia,"Initially, with a newborn in hand, it seems as though the blanket is rather large, but it is just perfect when you are wrapping up and swaddling the baby.  Now that my daughter is 3 months old, I'm so glad it is large because I can continue to swaddle her with this blanket -- other receiving blankets are too small.  The fabric is very soft and it launders well.  In fact, even with many baby blankets that I received as gifts, I went and ordered another one of these blankets because it was my favorite:)",5,1
Bumkins 3 Pack Waterproof SuperBib,Absolutely love these bibs.  They are the only bibs we use anymore with our baby.  They are soft and easy to wash after use.  Perfect.,5,1
Bumkins 3 Pack Waterproof SuperBib,"We had been using the terry cloth ones which were fine, but most of them were getting too small around my son's neck and he's average size. I was also interested in a bib that had a little pocket. I was worried that because these bibs are soft, the pockets wouldn't catch anything - I was so wrong! They fit perfectly with room to grow and they catch tons! They're lightweight and especially good for restaurants in reducing the amount of food on the floor. When we're finished, I just flip the pocket inside out and rinse it under the faucet - easy. I should add that at a baby shower, I received a heavier expensive plastic bib that ended up being terrible-  the piping around the edge tore and it stained easily. These are much better!",5,1
Baby Buddy: Baby's 1st Toothbrush,My 6 month old loves this! It is has very soft bristles perfect for tender gums. He chews this longer than anything else. I think this is better for smaller babies with few or no teeth.,5,1
Baby Buddy: Baby's 1st Toothbrush,This is a perfect 1st toothbrush. My LO loves to chew on this and very soothing since he is teething too.,5,1
Baby Buddy: Baby's 1st Toothbrush,"I love this product!! My 15 month old is struggling with getting in molars and the side teeth. Her regular teethers don't get those hard to reach places. This product does, and it freezes perfectly. I add a little Orajel training toothbrush. Because it is a teether and tooth brush  in one, I put her in bed with it. It relieves the pain while brushing and cleaning her teeth. I love it and so does she. I do freeze it with the Orajel and because it's flavored, it allows the orajel to freeze inside the teether, which provides longer lasting pain relief for her swollen sore gums.Now for the ONE THING that makes it a pain in the neck: It's small..... be aware that if it gets dropped or misplaced you could very easily spend an afternoon looking for it. This is my third one. I made the decision to buy it yet again simply because I decided that the benefits far outweigh the risk. In the morning, my daughter will throw things on the floor when she gets frustrated to be let out of her crib. Her teether was the only thing small enough that took me forever to find. I'm not even going to explain what happened to it when the dog ate it.Anyway, this is a simple thing to solve, but only while she isn't sleeping. I bought a pacifier clip and attached it to the teether so she couldn't lose it somewhere, the dog couldn't get it and it didn't get misplaced. If she sleeps with the clip, she will stay away pulling at it because she rolls over on her tummy and it pokes her hurting her.",4,1
Cloud b Baby Sleep Sheep with Rattle and 3 Spill Cloths - Natural,"This adorable and expensive looking little set makes the perfect baby gift. The sheep and burp cloths are very soft and plush, perfect for a baby's soft skin. It is a little small though so if giving as a gift I would probably add another little toy to go along with it.",5,1
Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali,I love it. It covered my entire body. Keeps feeding in public from being awkward. The terry cloth on the ends is perfect for wiping. It is very durable and stylish.,5,1
Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali,"I have 3 nursing covers and this one (I have Chateau Silver) is the best overall cover and my most used!  The thickness on the fabric is perfect.  Lightweight cotton that is breathable and lets light in to see baby, but not too thin that people can see through it.  It also is not too flimsy so that it just falls over baby's face (yes, one of my other ones does that).  The color and pattern are beautiful and sophisticated.  So although people DO know you are BFing when you're wearing this, it doesn't scream for attention or look so baby-ish as many products do.  I especially like the terry cloth corners, perfect for my spitter-upper.  When you're just learning to BF a newborn, you need both your hands and don't really have the ability to manage a burp cloth right away to.  The boning so you can see baby is excellent and needed for a new BFing mom IMO.  Just bought another one as a gift!Tip:  I always hang-dry mine and iron it once in awhile.  I think it makes it look nice and I've seen mine in comparison to other moms' whose look all wrinkled and more shrunken.  It doesn't take much drying or ironing time at all!  Also, try to roll/store it without messing up the wire and it will look new forever!",5,1
"Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug, Ladybug, Large","My 18 month old daughter absolutely loves her Wheely Bug! My only regret is that I didn't buy the large size. The small is perfect for her at the moment, but it doesn't seem like it will take long for her to outgrow it.",5,1
"Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug, Ladybug, Large","My granddaughter (10 months) played with a Wheely Bug at a friend's house and had a blast with it. My daughter told me about it and, as an insane grandmother, I ordered one right away.  This is a great all around toy; well made, adorable and perfect for a baby who's just about to start walking.  She crawls around their house dragging it by the ears, tail and handle. It is soft so if she does bump into it she just giggles.  It is not a &#34;walking&#34; toy as the wheels go in every direction.  As she gets better at balance it will make an excellent riding toy.A note about size.  Follow the manufacturer's recommendation, the small is perfect for children under 3.",5,1
"Bumbo Floor Seat, Aqua","My baby loves to sit in our lap so she can watch everything going on around her. The only problem with that is we have things to do around the house and she hates for us to lay her down. I saw this seat on Amazon and decided to try it out. It works perfectly for her. we had to put a blanket behind her in order to have a bit more support as my baby is only three months but she loves it. She sits there and laughs as she watches us cook, clean and do what needs to be done around the house. We DO NOT leave her unsupervised in it though. Just like anything else you have to keep a close eye on your baby while he/she is in any kind of seat, jumper,etc... It really is a great product and I'm so glad we bought it.",5,1
"American Baby Company Minky Dot  Chenille 4-piece Toddler Bed Set, Pink","I looked a long time for bedding for my son's bed. Everything in the stores was horribly made. I decided to trust the reviews of this and it's PERFECT. It's so soft. I've washed the set numerous times and it looks as new as the day I bought it. My son always tells people to come see his cozy bed. :) I do agree that it could be a little longer on the sides, but given the options out there I don't think you'll find anything better.",5,1
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Percale 4-piece Toddler Bed Set, Celery Patchwork",I wish I had a bedding set for my bed that has a fitted bottom top sheet for my bed!! It is perfect for a toddlers bed!!! I LOVE THIS SET!,5,1
"Regalo Hide Away Extra Long Bed Rail, White","This is a god-send. Our 2 year old toddler just advanced from her crib to her new adult bed, and we were worried that she would get out of bed and go downstairs in the morning. However, since we purchased this, she has stayed in bed all morning (sometimes singing songs and playing games for up to an hour or two until it's time for her to get up and get ready for the day.Construction is what yielded the 4 stars. It is pretty well made, and I was able to assemble it with only a minimum of straining. However, about a month or two after I installed it, the main section has begun to rattle a bit. Not too much to worry about, but still a bit annoying when it should remain perfectly still. It is sturdy enough that I can lean on it to kiss my daughter good night.It folds down to slide under the bed with some ease, but you wont be doing this too often as the weight of the mattress is often enough to slow down that movement. We dont have a box spring (just a metal frame) so we never slide it under the mattress, but someone with a box spring probably would have a slightly easier time.  There are hooks to catch the other side of the bed so it stays upright and does not collapse at all unless you want it to by pulling the tabs on either end. The only negative is that once you've tightened the ropes, there is alot of extra rope material that has nowhere to go.My only concern is that it is a bit low. It's about a foot and a half tall, coming up to just below her waist, and she stands on the bed with her hands on it and jumps up and down. If she jumps too much, she could fall forward and towards the ground, and I'm worried about her breaking her neck. If it were say above her waist and she could not jump over it, then my concerns would be alleviated.",4,1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",This is perfect for our 3yo daughter when we are traveling and visiting family.  We would definitely recommend it. Easy to use and comfortable.,5,1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I bought this for my two year old to use for camping trips or when we have family in town and need to give her bed to a bigger person. Fits her perfectly. Definitely not for big kids (like probably good for kids up to about 5 years old, but if they're tall, maybe not).It's lightweight, folds up like a camping chair and fits nicely into its little sack. She's slept comfortably on it a handful of times already and it's been great. The little fitted sheet that comes with it is nice because it's washable. The only thing that I don't love about it is that it's made of a similar nylon material as those folding camp chairs, so when she tosses and turns at night, you hear the ""swoosh, swoosh"" of the nylon. So if you're tent camping next to a little one that likes to toss and turn, you'll need to be a sound sleeper to ignore the sound (though many sleeping bags make the same swooshing noise too!)Overall, a great purchase and for the $[...] it cost, it was well worth it for camping while at home too.",4,1
"SwaddleDesigns Baby Lovie, Pastel Security Blanket with Chocolate Brown Trim, Lime","it's a perfect size and washes and dries well, so we love it, and it has been her favorite since she was very young (now 3). This is the third one we have purchased, in a panicked moment we couldn't find #1 and #2 so quickly hopped on Amazon to order #3. Of course quickly found #1 hours later and #2 reappeared a couple days later. Better safe than sorry, maybe one will go to live as a backup at Grandma's house.",5,1
"Luvable Friends Applique Feeder Bib with Teether, Blue","I bought this bib when my son was 4 months old and teething. Best bib by far! The bib is very absorbent, very good quality and it fit him perfectly!",5,1
Stroller Rain Cover,"great deal, great price. Fit my stroller perfectly, I have used it many times since then. Arrived very quickly, happy with purchase.",5,1
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,This little device successfully stopped my 5 year old and 3 year old from opening up the windows.  We have white window so the device sort of blends in and they can't move the window.  I love that it comes off fast in-case of an emergency and if the window is forced by an adult hand it would pop off.  Perfect item for someone who doesn't want to drill into their windows.  I highly recommend.,5,1
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","Perfect lock.Much better than those door chains, and looks better too.I test it on my garage back door.  I only used one there, and I could not break open the door even if my life depended on it, and I'm 5'9&#34; 220 pounds pretty fit.I put 2 on my front door and now have a great piece of mind knowing that probably only a car driving through my front door will break it open.I recommend this lock to all my friends and family.Also looks great with any of the finishes it comes with.",5,1
Phil &amp; Ted's Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"The Me Too hook-on chair was one of the best baby buys we have made! We just used it for a week in a beach house rental on the cereal bar and it was incredible! So easy to transport, lightweight, just dropped in the sink to clean the big messes. Perfect for the restaurants we visited as well! Much better than those nasty high chairs, plus more compact so servers weren't bumping into our son. Our son (13 months) absolutely loved using this chair!!!",5,1
"Blueberry Diaper Bag, RED","Got this in Red for a diaper pail liner.  Paired it with a 10 gal flip top trash can and it fits perfect.  We use it to toss cloth diapers and the little ones laundry.  The bag itself is very well made.  And MADE IN USA!!!  The red is very vibrant!  Drawstring at top...easy open, easy close.",5,1
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I'm so glad we bought this, my daughter hated her baby bath tub, but she was too small for the big tub, this worked perfectly. Don't waste your money on more expensive products, this works great and you wont use it for too long anyway.",5,1
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","Fits my Bugaboo Bee...but not perfectly.  If it's not really tight the cup holder tends to spin.  I also wish it was easier to remove the holder using one button instead of having to unscrew it.  (Especially when traveling).  Overall, I'm pretty satisfied.",4,1
ORE Originals Backpack Diaper Bag Flowers,"I have tried every bag out there, graco,evenflo,jeep,columbia,vera bradley,amy coe, they are either too big or too small or they didn't have a changing pad, and if you go in public you need a changing pad. It even has a little bag for me too. (wallet,keys,phone) because I don't carry a purse this bag is perfect but actually I have the stripe one because I have a boy, but I bought this one for a friend for her baby girl.This bag is awesome, and sometimes it goes on sale, I only paid like 12.00 for it.",5,1
"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted",Bought these cups to allow my 6 month old baby to start drinking from cups. They are perfect for her. She still is learning to hold herself-normally we hold it up for her to drink from the side without the sippy top and they are great.  We've used both with and without the top and either work great.  I want her to learn to not spill without the need for a sippy top but once she is able to hold herself im sure we'll use the top then too.,5,1
"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted","Perfect Size, perfect colors.  Easy to clean and easy to use.  I use them for my 2 and 5 year old and have been using them for about a year.  I love how I was able to use them with the top on when my son was 12-24 months and with the top off for my oldest.  I dont think I will need the tops very long, but I like these cups so much I am going to order more.",5,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Pink",item was perfect. very comfy and helped relax and ease baby to sleep. i would recommend buying a size larger because they will outgrow a swaddle REAL fast.,4,1
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","These little pink bunnies are perfect for protecting little necks from car seat straps!  My daughter loves her pink bunnies!  Better yet, they are machine washable!  They are super soft and also prop up a sleepy baby head when they decide to take a nap on a long car ride. Definitely recommend these!",5,1
"Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Fleece &amp; Pink Trim",This is a great product.  It supports the baby perfectly in their car seat.  I also like how you can use it in the stroller also.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone.,5,1
Kettler Kids Bouncer-Beige,We got this bouncer as a gift from my uncle and aunt. Our baby loves to play in this bouncer and even sleeps in it. The slant position is perfect for her specially soon after feedings. We simply love this item.,5,1
Cloud b Baby Turtle with Quiet Rattle,"This rattle is adorable! It's the perfect size for tiny hands, and although my baby hasn't reached the age where he can actually hold things yet, he likes to hug it to his chest and he likes looking at it when I make it rattle. Aside from it being a rattle, it's really well made and is just too stinkin' cute! We collect turtles, so this is a baby toy that will probably remain out with our collection instead of getting packed up once the baby outgrows it.",5,1
The First Years Compass Deluxe Folding Booster Car Seat - Giraffe,"I did a lot of research for booster seats and this one was a definite ""Yes!"". The Compass seat is the only one that folds down, making it excellent for travel, especially on an airplane. My husband just left for deployment to Kuwait for 7 months and I knew I'd be taking a lot of plane trips during the time he was gone. I needed a seat that was safe, comfortable for my daughter, easy to transport, and easy to keep clean. The cover of the seat snaps off easily in different pieces so you only have to wash the pieces that got soiled. I threw it in the washing machine on the hand wash cycle and then air dried it....no more struggling to get the 1-piece cover off for 20 minutes and struggling to get it back on for 20 minutes or longer. The seat adjusts easily in the car and it takes about 5 seconds to fold it down for travel. She loves the armrests and the hidden cupholders and the wrap-around head piece is the perfect size so she can still see out the window and she has head support when she falls asleep. I did purchase the $19.99 bag for the carrier so I could check it with our baggage on the airlines. the bag unzips completely so you just lay the seat in it. I would recommend this seat to anyone!!!!  The print is adorable, my daughter loves it and it smooth and comfortable. I am in love!!!!",5,1
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",This product does exactly what it says. You place it in your baby's bath water and it beeps if it is too cold or too warm. Before I had this I would spend a good 4-5 minutes adjusting the temperature of the water. Then I would second guess myself wondering if I was going to burn my baby with hot water or upset him with too cold water. With the aquatopia thermometer it's perfect every time!,5,1
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,We have not used this bed rail much as it is on a spare bed but it seems sturdy and we have not identified any problems with it so far.I do want to commend Regalo on their customre service.  One of the spring loaded tabs that hold the rail in an upright position was not working right when we put the rails together.  I emailed the company and received a respone within 2 hours.  I explained the issue and they asked which part was defective and sent out a replacement.  The newpart snapped right into place and is working perfectly.The ease with which we got the replacement part was refreshing in an era where I have come to expect bad customer service.  I would certainly purchase from Regalo again.,4,1
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,I love it! It really does come in handy. It doesn't take to much space so it's perfect fit small kitchens,5,1
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,"LOVE THIS! We have two, one upstairs and one in the downstairs playroom. Perfect to protect your items from being unplugged by a curious toddler. Safety 1st quality, and a great deal.",5,1
Single Bottle Rack,"I love this rack! It keeps my counterspace well organised and clean! I use Avent bottles and nipples and yes, it doesn't hold them all perfectly, but it  does keep most of them. It holds nipples perfectly and dries them so well.",5,1
Baby Cie Succion Bowl - Les Animaux de la Ferme,"Functional and adorable as well--an excellent product!  Contrary to one of the reviews I saw, I had no trouble with the suction cup, it worked perfectly.  Customer service from Touch of Europe is excellent, too.  They are fast and courteous and we've been happy with every purchase.  Highly recommended!",5,1
NoJo Jungle Babies Coral Fleece Blanket,This blanket is so soft and well made.  It is a perfect addition to the set as the comforter is too bulky to use in the crib - this will certainly keep baby warm!,5,1
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I recently bought this product for my 2 month old baby.  I already had the Bobby Pillow which is perfect for when I sit in my Glider Rocker; however, I did not like using the Bobby Pillow other than in that one chair.  The bobby pillow will shift out of position if you aren't sitting in a chair that will brace the sides of the bobby pillow.  This pillow holds the baby right in position, and if I need to temporariliy stand up while nursing the baby, the pillow stays in position.  This is perfect when I have to attend to my 2 year old daughter.  I like taking this pillow to other people's houses too because, I can sit on a sofa, a kitchen chair, a lawn chair, etc with a Nursing Cover.. and still nurse the baby comfortably where I never could do this before.  I found I can use this pillow while reclining on the sofa because even when I lean back, this pillow stays upright and still holds the baby up to my brest.  Wish I would have gotten this sooner.  For my first child, since I already had the Bobby, I thought this pillow was unnecessary.  I love the freedom and versatility this pillow provides.  So, I recommend owning BOTH Brest Friend and Bobby Pillow for comfortably brestfeeding.  (I even started exploring breast feeding in a Sleepy Wrap.)  To be successful at brestfeeding your second child, you need to have the freedom to move around so you can still take care of and enjoy your older child at the same time.",4,1
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","I am so glad I found out about My Brest Friend via navigating through Amazon.com.  I got the Boppy first, and it is too soft to support my baby for nursing; it also constantly slips away from me, and my baby tends to slip between me and the Boppy. For these reasons, my back felt strained when I used the Boppy for nursing. Then, I bought ""My Brest Friend"" and it worked great -- all the problems that I just mentioned were solved -- it's firm and supportive, and it also ""locks"" around my waist so it won't slip.  It wasn't perfect though; I still needed to use a small pillow or stuff a blanket between the MBF and my arm when my baby was less than 1 month old, but it was alot better than the Boppy.  Now that my baby is more than 2 months old, I don't really need to use this pillow anymore for nursing, but i still use it to support his weight when I carry him around the house since he is quite heavy for my arm and back.  The Boppy is NOT the ideal pillow for nursing, but it is good for letting my baby lie on to rest/sleep and as a support pillow for burping my baby in a sitting position, so I still recommend having a Boppy.",5,1
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","My DS is now almost 6 months old and I can tell you, I could not live without this thing the first 4 months of his life!! I took it everywhere - to my parents', my in-laws, I even took it to friends' homes if I was visiting. It puts the baby in the perfect position and is very comfortable to wear. It is adjustable, so from the moment I brought DS home to 4 months later when my body had gotten progressively smaller, the fit was never a problem.It has a small pouch pocket in the front, in which I kept a small tube of nipple cream and a small washcloth for dribbles. Once DS got bigger, he started to outgrow it (weight-wise), but even now I still use it for night feedings. He falls asleep on and if I didn't move around so much, he would sleep there all night long!The cover is removable and can be washed, which it does fine, as long as you make sure the velcro doesn't get caught on any other laundry and tear stitching or something else. I suggest washing it on its own.It is a bit more cumbersome than the Boppy since you really need to clasp it together for it to stay in position. When you have a hungry baby, sometimes that short amount of time to do the clasp can seem like an eternity! But that is a small inconvenience. I actually have one of each - the Boppy for one room and the MBF for the nursery.I highly recommend this anyway. I love it!!",5,1
Skip Hop Saddle Bag-Charcoal,"I love the Chicco Liteway but we know with all umbrella strollers, there is limited basket space.  This fits my needs perfect for the day at the zoo or any other trip that will last about half a day.  The bag is small as other post have said but it fit a lot!I have the following in my bag:Front zipper pocket: Child size spoon and fork, 4 wet ones singles, kleenex, neosporan spray, and a small first first aid kitInside pocket: Two size 5 diapers, ziplock bag of wipes, arm and hammer diaper baggy, disposable changing pad, a pack of table toppers, neutrogena sunblock for body and the face sunblock, ace instant compress, a light weight wind jacket, and a change of clothes.I can now put this on the outside and put just our lunch box in the basket.  I'm IN LOVE!",5,1
Buddy Bears Dark Brown 16&quot; by Kids Preferred,Buddy Bear is the perfect size for cuddling.  He arrived quickly and has been a big hit. I really like that it can be washed over and over again to keep it clean & healthy.  Thank you!,5,1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Pupsqueak Take Along Toy,"great toy!!! my daugther loved this toy since she was like 2 months and has not gotten tired of it since.  These toys are sooooo well made!  They say just spot wash but i have thrown it int he wash and dryer literally over 50 times and not only is it still in PERFECT condition, not a single seam has broken and the electronic barjing box in the doggie tummy still barks!!! So well made and so well loved....great toy!!!",5,1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My 4 month old loves her Jacques the Peacock.  I was plesantly surprised when it arrived that it was larger than I had expected, but yet still is the perfect size for my baby to pull into her mouth.  She loves the krinkly material in the wings, and all the different features.  I love that it keeps her occupied in the car oor laying on the floor for long periods of time.  This is my third baby, and the peacock is one of my favorite infant toys I have had for any of my children.",5,1
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"This is a great toy...interesting patterns, cute little song, perfect green legs for little hands to grab, squeaks and jingles! Just don't measure baby's length with it.  It is not accurate unless you really stretch it out.",5,1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,"I first bought this giraffe for my nephew, who immediately loved the lil' guy. When I saw my nephew playing with it, I decided to purchase one for my own little baby. She was too young to play with it when I bought it, but she is now at the perfect age to play with it (4 months). Anything that touches her hand is immediately grabbed, and this toy is no exception. I love this toy because there are a lot of easy-to-grab parts on it for her little hands. The rings around the neck, the legs, and the tale are perfect handholds. However, at her age, her hands are still a little small for the giraffe so she loses her grip and drops it frequently.  I wish its legs were thinner so she could hold onto it easier. I also think the color sceme is excellent, because it is colorful enough with contrasting colors to grab her attention. My favorite is that the tummy is a black and white checked fabric - Hello fascination! Once she catches sight of the tummy she won't look away. Not only does it look cute, but it also has a lot of sounds; the ears and one foot is crinkly, and the feet have squeakers or rattles in them. My only complaint is that the head is backwards...Unlike the picture, where the giraffe faces forward, my daughter's giraffe's head is turned so it is looking behind it. A little complaint, but still annoying.I highly recommend this toy for a go-to baby shower gift. All little babies will love how interactive and engaging the giraffe is, and moms will like how cute it is.",4,1
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,This toy is perfectly made and selling at a wonderful price - but it doesn't seem to hold my 9 month old son's attention very well at all. Bummer!! Still at least 4 stars for looking cool in my opinion... :),4,1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"This is great, I bought mine used through craigslist. The woman I bought it from took excellent care of it. Everything works like it should. Braydon loves the gentle vibration and that moving parts at a little over a week old. I expect that he will really enjoy the setting that allows for baby to jiggle the animals to make the music, light, and animal movement start.  Wonderful chair, perfect for kitchen and bath tIme for momma to get things done.",5,1
Built NY Double Thirsty Tote Black/Leaf Green,"I am a mommy on the go so sometimes I'll run to the store really quick, and I hate taking the bulky diaper bag afraid that I might forget it in my shopping cart. So this is just perfect for me I just get some whips, a diaper, strap the tote around my purse and off I go.",5,1
"Built NY Comfy Bib, Candy Pink",LOVE this bibI'm the mommy of a big time drooler since she was 2 months. Cloth bibs get soaked in 10 seconds and give her a rash on her chest. These are worn all day without getting moist at all. perfect size. stylish. overall VERY happy. Just bought two more,5,1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",We received this swing from a friend for our new baby.  It came from amazon so quick and setting it up was pretty easy!When we brought our new baby home and used the swing there was a very audibly loud clicking noise whenever we would turn on the mobile because the mobile would get stuck for some reason.  It was horrible.  Somehow our baby girl didn't mind although sometimes it startled her.  We hated the noise though.  After a week of not being sure what to do we called Fisher Price customer service.  It only took less than 5 minutes and we had an entire new motor housing being shipped to us for free!  It took a bit over a week to get the new motor housing but it was easy to switch them out and now it is perfect!!I had originally wanted the little lamb swing but it didn't plug in and it was more important to us not to have a battery run swing.  I do love that we can used batteries if needed but right now its plugged in. Honestly I am glad I went with this one because its NOT white so the off white hides spit up.  Also our daughter adores the starlight show! She just stares and stares till she falls asleep.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",This swing was easy to put together and I enjoy watching my granddaughter look at the lights and the butterflies when they are in motion. Luckily the swing also used batteries because we had a problem with the AC adapter not working. We called Fisher Price customer service and they sent another adapter out to us. The swing is now working perfectly with the AC adapter.,4,1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",Just wish it was as perfectly quiet as the fisher price lamb swing which we have. I bought this one for the tray as I feel safer. The lights and sounds are great. I think we will get used to the mild motor sound. I would think all the motors to these cradle swings made by fisher price would be all the same as far as sound in operation. The mild motor sound may actually be comforting to the baby is also my thought. Will find out as we plan to switch her to this swing today.The other lamb swing we will still use for awhile but feel much safer having the tray. So I have $300 in two swings. If I had it to do over I would order the swing with the tray in the first place.,4,1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","this swing is so pretty and just wonderful.  our daughter has loved it since she was 3 weeks old.  the butterflies catch her attention until she falls asleep.  the single thing i wish was different is that i wish the sounds included wombs sounds, then it would be totally perfect.  but this is still gorgeous and i use it several times every day.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I absolutely LOVE this swing. My son loves to be held in a cradle position, like his carseat, and this swing. He prefers being held, but that isn't always an option, and this swing is perfect. He takes his naps in this swing, he isn't old enough to enjoy the toy bar or the mobile yet, but I love the nature and music sounds. And the fact that is has two different swing positions. The only downfall I think this swing has, is that it doesn't have the plug in option, like the Fisher Price Rainforest Cradle swing. Which is weird, since they are the same type of swing, Fisher Price just didn't give the Papasan swing the wall plug in option. Be prepared to go through about 4 D batteries a month, but it is WELL worth it. And honestly, as much as we use this swing, 4 weeks isn't bad at all to go through only 4 batteries. I'll spend $5 a month on batteries if it comes to my son being happy and sleeping well. I would buy this swing over and over again, and recommend it to everyone.",5,1
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"I recommend this chair for sleep-deprived parents looking for a solution for their equally sleep-deprived infant who won't sleep in their crib or bassinet.My son refuses to sleep for more than a few minutes at a time in his bassinet right now (he's seven weeks old).  I bought this chair a week ago and both of us have gotten more sleep this week than in weeks past.  It cradles him nicely in the included infant body support and his head rests perfectly in the head support.The fabrics are soft, but not too soft, and the vibration feature is just right.  My son doesn't react either way to vibration a lot of the time, but it does help sometimes.The only real drawbacks to this infant seat are its length and its lack of volume control.  Thankfully, my son fits into the seat nicely, but his feet are coming close to the edge of the chair and he will grow out of it in the next few months.  Also, while there is no volume control, the music isn't that loud.  So it could be worse.I will kind of miss the chair when he does grow out of it and goes to his crib!",4,1
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"We got the duck potty yesterday in the mail.  My 2 year old son was super excited about the duck part.  We opened it, immediately went to the bathroom, put it on the toilet (perfect fit on our elongated Kohler bowl even with no adjustment), he sat on it an pooped right away.  He was SO PROUD, to have gone on the big potty.  I'd call that instant success.  5 stars!",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Wide Neck Storage Travel Caps Replacement, 2 Pack",Bought these to cap off my 5oz and 9oz Born Free glass bottles so that I can pump directly into the bottles and store them in the fridge.  Fits perfectly! Happy with purchase.,5,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I admit, I didn't get Sophie the Giraffe at first when my mom insisted I had to get it for my baby daughter.  It was a fancy squeaky teether and that was that.Well, I get it now.  Babies love Sophie.  My baby loves Sophie.This little giraffe is absolutely darling.  Cute face, adorable spots, just one sweet package.And the squeaking.  This thing squeaks if you look at it hard enough, so my daughter loves to bite on the head, body, etc.  The rubber is nice and soft and great for little gums.My own complaint is the paint.  No, I'm not worried about it being harmful to my baby, but having purchased two different Sophies (one at a store, one here on Amazon) and having both fade eventually does cause me to frown.  I get this is the nature of the dye, but it does keep this from being perfect.",4,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"At first I was very hesitant to buy this teether. I was thinking the cost was pretty high for just a teether and I was worried it would be too big. However, when i opened the package I knew it would be perfect. She is very soft and is a great material for babies. My son is three months old and teething so I had to get something for him to be able to hold himself. Sophie is great. She is easy for him to hold and he loves to chew on her legs and ears. He also loves to hold on to her and he enjoys that she squeaks(he giggles). I think the item is a very good product for any age and I highly recommend it. The only thing I would be careful of is water getting in it. I hold my finger over the hole so the squeaker wont get ruined.Great product!",5,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Fast shipping and delivery though the package had a hard time during the freight but the rest is just perfect. Sophie is also the perfect product for baby they just love it ! It must be at least the 5th or 6th one that I buy for presents.,5,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I finally gave in (because I thought it was so cute) and purchased one of these for my daughter.  None of her other teething toys would fit in her mouth. Plus, most of them were hard for her to grip onto. Sophie is perfect. She has so many places to hold and so many small surfaces to chew on. My 2.5 year old also got a major kick out of making the toy squeak. This toy has lasted well after months of use from both a baby and toddler. This is on my list of baby gifts.",5,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,We love Sophie at our house... she is a great teether and a great toy for entertainment.  Our 18 month old still loves her.  She is the perfect size for gripping and holding and biting... she is natural which is great too... and she is SO cute!,5,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie, oh Sophie, your time has come. My granddaughter, Violet is 5 months old and starting to teeth. What joy little Sophie brings to Violet. Sophie is made of a very pliable rubber that is sturdy but not tough. It is quite easy for Violet to twist Sophie into unheard of positions to get Sophie into her mouth. The little nose and hooves fit perfectly into small mouths, and the drooling has purpose. The paint on Sophie is food quality.Sophie was born in 1961 in France. The maker had wondered why there was nothing available for babies and made Sophie from the finest rubber, phthalate-free on St Sophie's Day, thus the name was born. Since that time millions of Sophie's populate the world. She is soft and for babies little hands easy to grasp. Violet especially loves the bumpy head and horns of Sophie. Sophie has a long neck that easy to grasp and twist. She has lovely, sizable spots that attract Violet's attention. Sophie has happy little squeaks that bring squeals of delight from Violet. She is able to make Sophie squeak and that brings much joy. Sophie's smooth skin is soothing to Violet's little gums. Sophie is 7 inches tall and is the exact correct size for babies to hold and love.As you well know the first thing babies grasp, goes into their mouths- how wonderful to have a toy that stimulates all of the senses and helps with the issue of teething. Sophie is small enough to fit into any size pocket or bag. Sophie is the perfect find for babies from a few months to a year old. How wonderful to hear the giggles and laughs that emanate from babies who find Sophie irresistible. Viva La Sophie!Highly Recommended.  prisrob 12-11-09",5,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son is teething and absolutely LOVES this toy.  Whenever he sees it, he gets so excited and reaches for it.  The rubber and various sizes make for perfect teething.  I highly recommend this and expect to be able to continue to use it as a toy my son will enjoy even when he's not teething.",5,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby loves this teether.  We always leave it at home though, because I don't want to chance loosing it because of the price.  I nick-named it ""Seventeen Dollar Sophie."" lol  The only slight dissapointment I had was seeing that this $17 toy was kind of small.  But it is really perfect.  If it was any bigger, she wouldn't be able to hold it well.  We love it.Tip - If washing with water, hold your finger over the little whole. Any water that gets in would be hard to get out and could harbor germs.",5,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,The neck is just the right size for little hands to grab and all of the edges are perfect for teething,5,1
Ellaroo Mei Hip Baby Carrier - Mumbai/Natural Organic Cotton Canvas,"I have used quite a few carriers- the Moby Wrap, The Ergo Carrier, slings and mei tai's of all kinds but the ellaroo hip carrier is my all time favorite! I have 2 girls who are built very very differently and it was very comfortable with each one of them and they both love it.One reviewer said their little one couldnt turn and see things but my girls loved it because they COULD see everything. They could look and see where we are going or look the other way to see where we just came from or they could just cuddle into mommy. It's perfect for kids who WANT to be outward facing but cant be because carriers that outward face tend to hold them up by the crotch, which puts pressure on their  hips and spine and cause developmental issues. This carrier supports them in a way that is good for development, comfortable for mom (it doesnt dig into neck but nicely spreads out over your shoulder for good balanced support). I love it, my girls both loved it. (Used it with my first until she was 15months old but then I was too pregnant to keep using it). Now I am using it with my 4 month old- 16 Lb baby very comfortably!",5,1
Embossed Damask Creation Bassinet Liner/Skirt &amp; Hood - Color Ecru - Size 16x32,I received a wicker bassinet as agift and wanted a way to dress it up. This liner was perfect. It looks just as pictured! It also looks good without the hood attached. The ivory makes it able to match in almost any color decor. Definately would recommend the item! will be using it again for my second child!,4,1
Classic Eyelet Baby Blanket Set - Color White eyelet,I purchased this blanket set for a carriage for my 1st grandchild. The carriage was my son's and is 30 years old. My daughter-in law said she would love to have it for their 1st child. The carriage is in excellent condition but I needed the pillow and blanket to make it complete. The blanket is a little thin but the pillow is perfect and makes the carriage complete. The fabric is a pretty eyelet.,5,1
Baby Trend Silverado Sit N' Stand Plus Double Stroller,"After thousands of hours of research, I FINALLY purchased a double stroller. Though the Phil & Ted Vibe Brand NEW! Phil & Teds Vibe Buggy With Doubles Kit- Redwas in consideration for a little while, the final pair I narrowed it down to were the Joovy Caboose UltraLight Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stand On Tandem Stroller, Blackand the Baby Trend Sit N Stand PLUS Baby Trend Silverado Sit N' Stand Plus Double Stroller.Ultimately, what is good for you is going to depend alot on the age of your kids, how often you plan to use it, and under what conditions. My daughters are 3 months and 2 1/2 years old. Realistically, I didn't think I'd be using this double stroller all that much, but I wanted to have one for the times when I knew I would need it. In my case, the winner ended up being the Baby Trend Sit N Stand Plus. Here's why:PHIL & TED VIBE:Brand NEW! Phil & Teds Vibe Buggy With Doubles Kit- RedI was initially attracted to this one because of its compact design and light weight. I also liked the Vibe over the other P&T; models because you don't need to take the jumpseat off in order to fold it up (according to the website anyway). But in reality, folding this thing up was kind of a pain. Next-- In the ""infant + toddler"" mode, I kind of felt like I was putting my infant in the glove compartment. Talk about claustrophobic! Thinking down the line, in the ""2 toddlers mode"", it seemed that accessing your children in this stroller is not all that easy. The jump seat does not recline, and it is not particularly accessible. I pictured myself trying to squeeze a sleeping toddler into that ""underbasket"" seat and I figured I was asking for trouble. Lastly, I just couldn't justify the cost (nearly $900 with the doubles kit) given that I didn't think I was going to use it that often. However, it did handle well and was very light. Despite its maneuverability, the cons seemed too great in comparison to the cost (plus it is not compatabile with ANY car seat)JOOVY CABOOSE ULTRALIGHT:Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stand On Tandem Stroller, BlackCertainly a better price than that Vibe! Was surprisingly light and easy to maneuver. It was actually compatible with my Combi car seat (which is rare). My 2 1/2 year old seemed to really like standing on the platform in the store. I actually almost bought this one except for three major things:1) The folding mechanism is annoying. You need to use two hands. When you have two kids in tow, you often don't have one free hand-- let alone two. Especially if you are someplace like a shopping center parking lot, or a city street, where you need your eyes and ears alert as well as your hands free.2) It occurred to me that even though my 2 1/2 year old seemed to enjoy riding in the store during the test drive, what would happen after several hours at the zoo? She stills needs a good 90 minute nap everyday, in the middle of the day. I could foresee that this could be a problem because there is no way to carry an infant AND a napping toddler.As much as I WANTED to like this stroller, I realized that its probably better if your kids are both over the age of 3 vs. having both kids under the age of 3. But I really liked the idea of a Sit N Stand because I knew it wouldn't be long before my oldest wouldn't need to sit in the seat at all, but I probably had a decent amount of time where I would still need the ""full seat"" capability.3) The seat/platform area on the Joovy was really small with the infant seat installed. So even if my daughter wanted to sit and take a break, it would hardly be comfortable. (and she's small too, so I can only imagine what it would be like when she got older)BABY TREND SIT n STAND PLUS Baby Trend Silverado Sit N' Stand Plus Double StrollerAfter much research, I discovered the Sit N Stand PLUS. This is a step up from the basic Sit N Stand, in that it can convert from a compact tandem stroller with 2 full seats to a traditional Sit N Stand. Problem Solved!! The back seat even reclines a bit (but not fully) for the toddler to nap. The back seat removes easily, and can be folded up into the storage basket while still allowing room to carry stuff. Even though it officially is not compatible with the Combi car seat, it actually seemed pretty darn secure when I tried it. I can take my infant along, and not worry about the toddler needing to nap. And when the toddler wants to stand and ride, she can do that too. It only takes a minute to take the seat out. Unlike the Joovy, there is plenty of space on the bench seat and in the standing area. The one-hand fold is easy and effortless to use! It includes both a parent tray and child snack tray (with cupholders) and you can access the basket easily from the sides even if your child is in the back seat. It includes full sun canopies for both seats, which are also easily removed when not needed.  To top it off, this stroller is about $100 less than the Joovy. This stroller is certainly not perfect... it IS heavier than the Joovy or the Phil & Ted and no, it does not turn quite as easily (though not significantly harder either). However, given the cost difference; the frequency of usage that I think I'll have; and the potential longevity as my daughter grows out of the seat and into the standing only preference... getting this one seemed like a no-brainer compared to the significantly more expensive Phil & Ted and Joovy.",4,1
"Mimi the Sardine Coated Organic Cotton Child's Apron, Jungle","Fantastic apron for kiddos. The sizing is perfect and flexible-- will fit children from 1-7ish. The material is thick and durable, and coated to make for easy cleaning. The print is bright & fun.Ideal for shared baking days in the kitchen or art projects!",5,1
"Kolcraft Contours Options Tandem Stroller, Ruby","After much research on double strollers we finally settled with this one. As all the other reviews claim it is heavy, but it is an over all great double stroller. My two girls fit perfect in it, a 2 year old and 2 month old, and there is no problem with height. I love that both seats can recline so they both can sleep but there is limited room. It is very easy to turn. Folding it up is easy and it requires you to remove one of the seats but it is not at all difficult.  People stop and ask me all the time where I got it from.",4,1
Cloud b Sleep Sheep On The Go Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds,"I had wanted to order the larger size one and didn't realize that I had ordered the smaller one. I was glad because it is the perfect size for my baby. I can attach it to her carseat, crib, or anywhere. I didn't like the fact that there were whale songs instead of heartbeat but my baby loves the whale songs and that is what see uses to fall asleep. It really calms her we take it everywhere with us. I don't know what we would do if I forgot it anywhere. I am so happy with it and plan on buying the larger one and the lavendar lab too.",5,1
Cloud b Sleep Sheep On The Go Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds,"This product is soft, cuter than the picture, and a perfect size, BUT I misread the product description and failed to see that ""mother's heartbeat"" is NOT one of the options. This sound is available on the larger size Sleep Sheep, and I just didn't note the difference. Since this is for a newborn I'll be returning it. My fault; the product looks great, but for a newborn it seems like the heartbeat sound should be included.",4,1
"The Mommy Hook, Black with Black Pad","These are perfect. We decided to try these and started with one on the stroller and ended up buying a 2nd and ordering 2 more to go with the Travel System that was a baby shower gift for my sister. We considered them a must have at that point. She is every bit as in love with them as we are.They are very sturdy, priced just right and hold quite a bit. It is nice to be able to add shopping bags without taking up the cargo basket.",5,1
"The Mommy Hook, Black with Black Pad","Saw this on a friend's baby registry and realized it would be perfect to help me carry in all my shopping bags from the car into the house in just one trip (assuming the bags are more bulky than heavy).  Works very well, and I'm sure it would be handy for its other intended uses.  Great value for the functionality.",5,1
"The Mommy Hook, Black with Black Pad",Purchased these for a trip to Disney. They worked perfectly! They hold a lot of stuff and are very sturdy. The padded handle is just a wonderful plus. After our days of strollers are done I will keep these around as they would work great for carrying grocery bags or hanging belts in closets. Great purchase!,5,1
"The Mommy Hook, Black with Black Pad","This hook is perfect for carrying my diaper bag, key rings, baby toys that have a loop, or even a really heavy grocery basket. Note: please make sure there is enough weight distributed on the other end of the stroller as you add items as not to flip baby out!!!The grip is soft and the clamp is easy to open and close but is not loose where it is easily opened. I love the green, it is my favorite color and matches the other green I have going on in my stroller and diaper bag (really just a personal preference).Overall, very functional and handy thing to have! Not heavy or bulky to keep attached all the time.",5,1
"Shermag Glider Rocker Combo, Pecan with Oatmeal","The first one of these gliders I received was not in the factory sealed box and, as soon as I removed the back pad which is packaged at the top of the box, I noticed that a large piece of wood on the back of the glider was split in half.  This was an obvious defect and would have been noticed by anyone examining the contents of the box.  I would like to say that as soon as I contacted Amazon, they immediately shipped me a replacement via overnight express.  The second one arrived in perfect condition.  At this point I don't know how long it will hold up, but I plan on donating it to a home for unwed mothers as soon as my daughter is done using it with my granddaughter.  I could not see spending $500 to $1,000 or more for something we only plan on using for no more than a couple of years.",5,1
Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory,"This attachment made our trip to the airport so much easier!  Everyone thought it was super clever and useful.  It was easy to use and made carrying our 2yr. old and her stuff a breeze!  I would suggest that you place all of your ""must haves"" in the luggage itself in the event there is lost luggage.  We also put my daughter's DVD player and toys in as well.  Having her safely secured in her car seat on the plane was perfect for my active child who would have most certainly squirmed out of the seat belt and created havoc on the plane.One other tip is to have your toddler on a child safety leash/backpack (we have the one that looks like a stuffed monkey from Wal Mart) throughout the airport to burn off that energy, then by the time you need to have them secured in the seat, he/she is ready for a nap.Going thru security took a little more coordination but because we didn't have to carry that much, it wasn't that hard.  Good luck, this is a great product!",5,1
Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory,"While we did not put our son in the carseat while it was attached to the suitcase, this did a wonderful job of allowing us to wheel the carseat through the airports. We put our son in his stroller which we checked at the gate and he had his own seat on the plane so this was perfect. Much less expensive than the other options and it works great!",5,1
Joovy Cool Essentials Parent Organizer,"Perfect fit, holds two drinks (one on each end), has storage pocket and zipper storage.  Used for 2 weeks daily on vacation and still looks like new!  Was a must have for us!",5,1
Munchkin Baby Care Cart,"If you are seeking a stable, cute place to store diapers, baby towels( not heavy adult towels), receiving blankets and other BABY sized items this will be perfect for you. I love mine. It stores my clothe diapers and inserts and other baby linens perfectly.",5,1
"Manhattan Toy Snuggle Pod, Peanut","My daughter received the Snuggle Bug baby and the Sweet Pea baby for Easter 2 years ago (at age 2) and is still playing with them. She calls their little 'pods'  their 'sleeping bags', and they must be tucked into them before bed every night. These babies have been washed many times and are still like new. A friend of ours had boy/girl twins last year so my girl was very into twins, and the sweet pea/snuggle bug combo made her a perfectly manageable, portable set of twins to play with and sleep with.Bottom line: Soft, perfectly portable and very sweet.",5,1
"Manhattan Toy Snuggle Pod, Peanut","We nicknamed out son ""peanut"" since he was so small when he was born and I hit the jackpot with this toy! Like the other reviewer said- I don't understand why this isn't popular either! It is adorable!!! Very soft, very ""huggable"", love the taggies for the hair and the satin pieces on the clothing for a tactile difference. My son loves him too! The Peanut Doll is primary colors- perfect for a boy. Just a side note- the doll does not have legs- it is more like the peanut shape (like it has a bunting suit on). Dolls are great toys for young children (and babies) since it aids emotional development and this toy is perfect for that job! I very highly recommend it- you will not be disappointed!!!",5,1
"Manhattan Toy Snuggle Pod, Peanut","It's soft, safe, washable and the cutest toy ever for our little granddaughter that we call ""Sweet Pea"". Is smaller than I expected, but turns out just perfect for a baby.",5,1
,"A slight pain to install (drawers are easy, but cabinet doors, have to be perfectly aligned), but once installed they work great. Easy to keep locked, or unlocked. At least for my kid, once she saw she couldn't open it, she stopped trying. I never installed any screws. The tape was plenty for me. One note of caution .. the tape is very sticky and does what it's suppose to, so when you are ready to remove it - it's not easy.",4,1

"American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Chenille Fitted Contoured Changing Pad Cover,Ecru","This is AMAZINGLY soft.  I don't know whether it really matters to the baby, but it sure seems a nicer place to rest a naked bum than on the rough terrycloth I've seen on other covers!  I have the Summer Infant contoured changing pad, and it fits perfectly -- EXCEPT for the straps.  If you plan on using the straps, know that the openings in this cover are very close to the middle -- only about 6"" apart.  It's workable -- you can extend the straps to a longer length, thread them through the holes in the cover, then double back out under the baby in order to then reach around to cross over the baby -- but seems like poorly-planned design to me.So if you don't plan on using the straps at all, no issues.  If you do plan on using straps and don't mind your baby having to lay down on part of the strap, no issues.  If you want the straps to fit snugly across your baby, you'll have issues once your baby is more than 6"" wide.UPDATE: We've been using this for almost 9 months now, with frequent washings, and it's still just as soft and plush as when I first bought it.",4,1
"American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Chenille Fitted Contoured Changing Pad Cover,Ecru","These are so soft and perfect!  1 year and too many washings to count, they still look brand new!!!  I would recommend these to everyone!",5,1
"American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Chenille Fitted Contoured Changing Pad Cover,Ecru",Love how soft this changing pad cover is. It fits our Summer Infant pad perfectly - and has two small slit cutouts for the security straps should you choose to use them. We will also be using changing pad covers to protect the material - but this looks so nice and is so soft!,5,1
Jolly Jumper Stroller Caddy - Stroller Handlebar Organizer,"I got this for my Uppababy Vista and I love it! Way better than the Uppababy one. I love that it has a large zipper compartment in the middle (can hold snacks, pacifier, wipes, its a pretty big spot) and it has two organizer slits on the outside where you can keep keys, phone, a small wallet. Such a bonus for just a cup holder. There is a big Jolly Jumper embroidered logo on the middle part, but it is in dark grey so it isn't that bad.The cup holders are great. They are really long so you can put in a tall skinny water bottle (like a smart water or those long ones from Starbucks). And the cupholders are big enough to put two Venti iced cups from Starbucks in there no problem. It does fit a tall iced cup in there too because it is wide enough. Even though the Uppababy handles are slanted, because this thing has 4 adjustable straps you can EASILY make it lay straight. Put some drinks in there and adjust it until it is straight and it is PERFECT!!! Love this thing... check out the first reviewer's video for more details, it is awesome.",5,1

Mini Bead Rattle,"Just got this for my 4 month old, who's just started grabbing things. She had been having trouble holding onto her other toys, which were a bit big and heavy. This little rattle is perfect! She can keep hold of it when she waves it around and she enjoys the sound.",5,1
Summer Infant Secure Sounds Digital Multi Room Monitor,"My honest review.This monitor is flimsily and feels cheap. I agree with other reviews that the volume is on or off no in-between. The volume doesn't go loud enough if your trying to monitor your kids with company over. The on button is not clearly labeled.... With all the con's I still give it 4 stars because this monitor does have its place. If you want to monitor two rooms at night this is perfect. No static, no loud beeps or other odd noises. You will hear the kids only if they make noise. The sensitivity is not like others monitors I've used were you can hear your children breath from across the room, but its sufficient. At night in a quite room you can rest and still be alert to your children's needs. - proud dad of a 1 y/o girl and a 1 month old son.",4,1
"Summer Infant All-in-One Potty Seat and Step Stool, Pink","This potty is very low to the ground.  Perfect for kids who are small for their age.  My kid had trouble climbing onto other potties, but this one is the shortest on the market.",4,1

"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","The kit came complete with the item in perfect condition recommend, was purchased from Venezuela and everything came perfect i love it",5,1
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","I happened upon this affordable teether on Amazon, and I am hooked! It is perfect for my 9 month old to handle. It is soft and colorful. The best thing is it is so affordable, you can afford to replace it and don't have to worry about losing it. I am glad I didn't waste my money on the Sophie teether.",5,1
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red",I decided to try this teether because my son was having a hard time with the larger round ones. He loves his pacifier so this seemed perfect. He loves it! Which means I do too. It has a couple different textures so he chews on all the parts of it. We keep ours in the fridge so it's chilly on his gums. I actually ended up buying a second one because our first one always disappears (or ends up at Grandmas). I would recommend it!,5,1
"RaZbaby RaZ-Pak Formula and Snack Container, Transparent Blue",I use this product to measure out my dog's daily dose of kibble into three meals and it works perfectly! It's easy for me to see how much he's been feed so far during the day and I can detach each of the pods if I want to take the kibble with me for training on a walk. The pour spouts let me dump it into his bowl.,5,1

"The First Years Spinning Drying Rack, White","I can seriously stack up TONS of random stuff on this thing. It is completely made of plastic, but so sturdy and well designed. I was a little concerned at first that I wouldn't have enough counterspace for this, because it is kind of big, but it fits perfectly beside my sink, and the spout for the drain-off at the bottom goes right into my sink. Other than bottles, I dry tupperware pieces, and so many other small thing on this. I plan on using this after my son isn't using bottles anymore just for my other stuff. It even holds glass bottles with not even a hint that it is going to tip over. DO NOT waste your money on another drying rack first like I did. The price of this one is so worth it. Get this one. It makes the menagerie of bottle parts that you are going to be juggling around for the next year of your baby's life LOOK ORGANIZED and like you got this all under control! ; ]",5,1
Playtex Fridge-To-Go Bottle Holder - Double,"I breastfeed exclusively and I always had such a hard time leaving the house with a bottle of breast milk along with the capability of making another bottle. I would put the bottle in a large cup with lid filled with ice. Then I would put my breast pump in a large zip lock bag with ice so I could keep using it and carry a spare bottle to fill. Each of those items were prone to spilling so I couldn't even put them in the diaper bag. When you go on long drives pumping is the only efficient way to feed a baby. Making a stop to feed is so time consuming, but I can pump while my husband or mother is driving and I can sit in the back seat and feed the bottle while someone is driving. This Playtex case is the perfect solution. I can fit two CLASSIC GLASS NURSER EVENFLO Size: 3X4 OZ and myLansinoh Manual Breast Pump, 1-Count(not attached to the bottle) plus there is a zipper section in front for extra nipples, a pacifier, teething ring, etc... This pack keeps everything cold for a long time. I know it works for six hours and it was still very cold. It also provides a tight fit for my glass bottles so I don't have to worry about them banging around. It doesn't take up a lot of space in the feezer.",5,1
Inglesina Fast Table Chair Turquoise,"I bought this seat last week, and used it this past weekend while one vacation, at the beach, where I didn't have all my comforts from home.  My son is 6 months old and he loved this seat.  He loved sitting at the table playing with his toys. The seat was very easy to hook to the table and was very stable.  The strap fits high on his chest, so it is perfect to help keep him upright. The seat is soft and he loved kicking and bouncing in the seat.  Another plus is that the bag for this seat is built into the seat, when in use it tucks nicely away.  It takes less then a min take the seat down, collapse it and put the bag around it.  I am going to florida next week and look forward to having this so my son will not be stuck in the stroller 24x7.I am very, very, very happy with this purchase.",5,1
Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,"I was really excited to try this out with my 8-year-old who needs constant stimulation in order to remain happy. We take numerous road trips each year, some spanning several days and some as short as 3-4 hours. Regardless, if he doesn't have some kind of entertainment, no one will be happy! We gave this a test run on a recent outing and I was pretty impressed. It folds down fairly compactly and I was able to fit it under my front passenger seat. He still sits in a booster and needed some help getting it around his waist, but once it was on, he was good to go.He was playing with cars on it, propped up his iPad to watch videos on it, he even ate lunch on it! I was skeptical about the lunch idea because it doesn't really sit as flat as it looks in the picture. Given that it's all folded up when you receive it, it's already got a little hill in the center that I don't think will ever go away, especially if you keep folding it to put it away when not in use. Even so, it still provided enough of a firm, flat surface for him to play on and eat his lunch on while I was driving. Usually it's a complicated circus involving numerous cup holders and creative use of the glove compartment. Now, everything fits nicely on his tray and he can still use his built in cup holders in his booster seat for his drink. Now if only it had a built in bib.. (kidding!) It did seem to minimize the amount of food bits that accumulated on the seat and floor around him, but there was still a bit of mess. The edge kept most of it contained though. And none of his cars slipped away and onto the floor, which is a huge bonus! I can't even count how many times I've had to exit the freeway on a long road trip to pick up toys that have fallen off his lap because I won't allow him to take off his seatbelt.The most important feature of this travel tray, however, is the safety. If there is a collision, the tray will collapse. Despite it being rigid enough to support play and dining, I could easily collapse it from the front with a single hand, so I have no worry of the soft material injuring him in any way should a (heaven forbid) collision ever occur. Overall, I think this is the ONLY option for play on a long road trip. Hard plastic trays that many people use may provide more play space, but they are DANGEROUS, and not only that, but there's no way to secure them to the seat anyway so they're likely to slide off just like everything else. This tray stays put and keeps the contents where you want them. This would even be great on plane trip as well. It can easily fit into a suitcase or duffle bag, no problem.The only reason I deducted a star is because it will never be flat like it shows in the picture. Picky kids may be annoyed by this and it may make some play a challenge, such as with play sets. My kiddo loves cars so the little bump made a nice jump for his invisible race track. I just want potential buyers to be aware that it is not perfectly flat like in the picture. Other than that, it's a great purchase and I'm glad I have it. Can't wait to try it out on our spring break road trip!",4,1
Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,"We drove from SC to WI and back for summer vacation and this was such a life saver! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it wasn't 100% perfect, if my son kicked his legs, his food would go flying back into his seat and so we had a lot of snacks just sitting in the seat with him. But, I still strongly recommend this for anyone traveling for a long distance!!",4,1
Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,"If you are traveling with a child on a plane and they are in a car seat, this is a must.  The fold down table will be out of reach and this tray will be perfect. It is soft and they can strap it on during take-off and landing.  My daughter was happy to have all of her books, crayons, and snacks on this tray.",5,1
Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,"Excellent product! We ordered 2 for our two children. I was a bit skeptical when ordering, due to a few of the ""not so happy reviews"" but I am glad I got these trays. They are soft (and therefore safe) but sturdy enough for those little arts & crafts while on the road. I would recommend to everyone. We have Britax Marathon car seats and these trays fit perfect.",5,1

Playtex Fridge To Go Bottle Tote - Double,Holds cold very well for breast milk but just not large enough. If slightly larger it would be perfect.,5,1
The First Years Compass Premier Folding Booster Car Seat in Daisy,"I have to be honest, I was a little concerned moving from Britax's Marathon car seat to this booster. It seemed a little unstable and not as safe. But it is perfectly safe. Using the car's seat belt stabilizes the seat very well and the positioning is perfect for my daughter. She outgrew the height requirements on her other seat so we purchased this.We found:-The grow-with-your-child height adjustment on the seat back will be very beneficial for our daughter.-The seat belt positioner is angled perfectly and safely.-It is quite roomy and comfortable and our daughter does very well on long trips in this.-It promotes a greater sense of freedom in our four-year-old. She can buckle/unbuckle herself from the seat. (This could be a drawback if the child isn't mature enough to keep the belt on while the car is in motion.)-The colors are ""girly"" enough to satisfy our little princess.-It folds very easily and is the most transportable seat we've found. This is  huge benefit for us as we do a lot of plane travel.",5,1

"LA Baby Countour Changing Pad 30&quot;, White","The dresser I selected for our nursery had a hutch that didn't allow enough room for a standard changing pad.

Pad was brand new and upopened, received quickly. Couldn't be happier!",5,1
"LA Baby Countour Changing Pad 30&quot;, White",I have had a hard time finding a changing pad to fit my crib and this one is perfect:) love it,5,1
"LA Baby Countour Changing Pad 30&quot;, White",This pad fits perfectly on our dresser. We had to get this one based on size because our dresser is smaller than the other changing pads. But it worked out great. The pad is constructed well and the cover we bought for it fits perfect.,5,1
"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Closed Security Gate, Black","Perfect on the height for what we needed.  Your standard &#34;tall&#34; baby gates buy Summer, etc our cat could still jump over.  And we really wanted to keep him out of the nursery.  Tried this gate and he won't even attempt it.  Installed well and looks great.  The only issue I have is the button on top to lock it can be kind of difficult to use at times.  But if that minor issue gets us the tallness we need then I'll take it.",4,1
"Boppy Pillow with Brocade Slipcover, Black and White",Love all the different designs.  Perfect boppy and cover design for little girl.  Great gift for new moms as well!,5,1
"Boppy Pillow with Brocade Slipcover, Black and White","Like the reviewer who gave it a low rating, I also have small breasts, but unlike her, I found this pillow very helpful. It fit perfectly around my middle so me and the baby could be comfortable during feedings. It saved a lot of strain on my neck, arms & back. My husband used it when he just wanted to hold & rock the baby without wearing out his arms. The slipcovers come off easily to be machine-washed. I highly, highly recommend this if you're going to breastfeed or even if you just want some hands-free time while still keeping the baby close. My baby doesn't need it anymore so now I use it as my neck pillow!",5,1
Boppy Bare Naked Pillow,"Ask any new mom what their favorite baby product is and they will have a impassioned review of an item that 'saved' them during the those bleary first few months.  For some, its the fancy breast pump that at first seemed too expensive and later became the cherished gateway for a few hours rest. For others, its the mechanical swing that allowed them to do some laundry or eat a meal.  For me, its the Bare Naked Boppy. A pillow for breast feeding? Oh it's not just for breast feeding. Sure, it provides the perfect little platform to rest your tiny one while she eats.  It frees up you hands to do such essential 4 am activities as flipping channels looking for something that isn't an infomercial on TV.  The boppy is an appendage, a constant companion.  Its good for a million uses, most of which are clearly warned against on the label.  Most of all the boppy is part of the ritual of feeding that I found so helpful in establishing breast feeding.  The bare naked version allows you to easily wash the cover.  The only way I would improve this product is to install a pocket that holds extra burp clothes so you dont have to go running for one in a pinch.",5,1

"Bunnies by the Bay Silly Buddy, Emmit",I ordered this for my baby when she is a newborn. It is hard to find soft plush animals for young babies. This is so perfect. It is unbelievably soft for a newborn. And completely understuffed-- basically flat-- so it is a wonderful little sleepytime lovey for a young baby. It has a sweet little rattle inside that is very quiet and it holds a pacifier in one hand if you want that too. I love how soft and sweet this little bunny is for my baby!!!!,5,1
"Bunnies by the Bay Silly Buddy, Emmit","With my first child my husband and I lost countless pacifiers, they bounced under beds, fell off tables at restaurants, were dropped out of strollers, it didn't seem to matter what we did, they would be lost and need to be repurchased regularly.Our second child would only take the blue pacifier that the hospital sends you home with and we discovered a certain company made them with soft little loveys already attached, the problem was that the pacifier could not ever be removed, it is sewn on. As result, partially our fault for not breaking him of it sooner, our son was about to turn three and still attached to the blue newborn pacifier from the hospital, with attached lovey (which would get filthy) we have never lost any of them, just worn them out - but it is not good for his teeth.Now we are expecting again and I discovered this Bunnies by the Bay lovey that is able to hold a pacifier. Yay! I am so excited to attach whatever pacifier we decide to use (definitely orthodontic!) but still not be constantly losing paci's. I will try to give another update later on how well the pacifier stays attached since we haven't used it quite yet (baby is due in May). So far though I love this white bunny lovey, it is so incredibly soft and very delicate and feminine looking. Perfect for our soon to arrive baby girl.",5,1
"Bunnies by the Bay Buddy Blanket, Skipit","The ""Froggy"" I purchased for my new grandson is wonderful.  He is a frog made out of blanket-like, very soft fabric.  He has satin binding and lining which is perfect for little hands rubbing fingers over it.  He is made with two arms, which makes it easier for a young child to hold.  I am very pleased with the quality of the ""lovey"" and  the speed in receiving my order.  This is a GREAT product!",5,1
JJ Cole System Bag - Graphite/Green,"According to my husband, I have about 15 diaper bags.  Not quite true, but almost!  I've had trouble finding one that fits all of daily needs - big enough to carry the essentials for a 2 1/2 year old and a newborn, yet small enough to be practical to carry into the grocery store and Chick-fil-A!  This bag is great!  The main portion of the bag is deceptively large.  At first I didn't think I would be able to fit much in it, but I just keep putting more and more in there, and it still has extra room (think Mary Poppins...).  I also LOVE the little iPod pouch on top.  I don't have an iPod, but it is perfect for my phone, earpiece, and keys.  With other bags, I was always finding myself throwing diapers, wipes, and other stuff out of the bag in search of the ever-elusive phone.  Now I've got it without having to dig! The front organization space (the ""purse"" section) is also wonderful.  Fits my wallet (which is huge), plus lipstick, powder, and my to-do list.  The side pockets fit a bottle of water or a sippy cup nicely, and the stroller straps work great!  All of this with a strap that hangs nicely across my body (I need both arms for both kids now)!  My sister-in-law has a diaper dude, but is considering going with a jjcole bag when she has her second.",5,1
"Baby Trend Double Snap N Go Stroller Frame, Black","I bought a Bob Revolution Duallie stroller with the car seat adapter, not knowing that it only would hold one car seat - and I'm having twins!  After much searching, I found this inexpensive stroller that would hold 2 car seats and not take up a ton of room in my vehicle (or stores, pediatricians office, etc..).  I was a bit skeptical after reading some reviews because I have Grace snugride carseats - but it is a wonderful product.  I put it together in no time at all and adjusted the bars for the perfect fit with my Grace car seats!  My twins aren't here yet, but I know this will get a lot of use while they are in their car seats!  It is easy to maneuver and fold and unfold.  The basket seems roomy enough and the parent tray is the bomb!  It is true you will only use it while they are in their car seats, but at $89 (WalMart) - my sanity and ease of movement is worth every penny!  Good luck - if you are having twins, this is a must!",5,1
Baby Trend Galaxy Sit N' Stand Stroller,"I initally bought this stroller about 2 weeks ago for an upcomming trip to the zoo with my son and a 4 month old I babysit.  I couldn't  wait so I took it out for a trial run a few days ago and was really impressed with this stroller. My daughter and son and both love it. My son is 3 and my daughter is 7 ...I know what you're thinking-- A 7 year old? But she wanted to try out the bench and standing area since the baby was gone for the day. And she LOVED it, and my son really liked it too. I have to tell you this stroller works wonderfully! I'm truly surprised. Even with my 50 pound 7 year old sitting/standing in the rear and my 3 year old up in the front, I still found the stoller easy to manuver. My husband who's 6 ft likes that the handles are high enough where he's not hunched over - but it's a perfect height for me too and I'm a whole lot shorter. This stroller is great for going to the zoo, or to festivals and stuff (which we do a lot). The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of its size and weight... even when folded, this stroller is a monster! ...It's HUGE and heavy. Make no mistake about it ----this is A-lotta stroller! I read a couple of reviews that said this stroller might be as heavy as a double stroller --and they might be right. In all honesty, I won't be using this stroller everyday. But that doesn't mean you can't (especially if you have the trunk space). It's easy to put up and down, so no worries there. This stroller also can adapt to any carrier you own already so that was a huge relief because the little girl I sit for owns an Evenflo and I had no problems( but if you do there is a number in the book you can call.) One thing I read in another review online; a lady said you can fit an infant carrier, snuggly, in the space behind the front seat and on the bench.... this is VERY TRUE. I tried placing the baby carrier in this area and it fit like a charm.... it doesnt wiggle or anything, just like she says. It almost feels as if the carrier was ""snapped"" into place. With this being said, I would use the bench straps as extra security, though.  I also read on another site that someone uses this stroller with her 3 kids: one sitting in the front, one toddler sitting on the bench, and one older one standing. I've never tried it but the back platform is really wide. Wide enough to hold two kids in the back (facing each other) just like she said. All in all, this stroller is money well spent. My only wish is that I knew about it a lot sooner. Good Luck! :)))",4,1
Kids Line Switch Plate Cover - Lady Bug,switchplate is adorable and matches all the other decor perfectly. the screws it comes with are brass colored though so i just used some white ones i already had and that looked better. its a shame this line is getting hard to find.,5,1
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"This is all you need, really.  Don't get a crib yet, or a bassinet or anything.  Just get this thing. The only think I don't like is that the mattress doesn't see to sit perfectly flat on the upper part.  My baby enjoys rolling over, but it wakes her up in her sleep, so this slightly inclined mattress isn't a big help.  Still, it's so easy to set up and small enough to move around my apartment.  There's a similar one with 3 little elephants that my mom has, and my baby enjoyed those elephants more than the leaf & giraffe combo here - see if you can get that version, but it's easy enough to hang different toys from that arch.",4,1
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,I bought an 'opened box' but the item was intact and had no problem assembling the PAC n Play. That took all of 10-15 minutes. Would have taken less time if I had read the instructions first!  It is roomier than I expected and just what I need for the times that baby will be visiting. Perfect for the times when you need to put baby down for a nap or just an overnight stay or two.I am very glad I purchased this item and wish I had bought it 2 months ago....an excellent purchase for short term baby care!,5,1
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"i bought it for my son, he's 4 months now. he LOVES this bed and sleeps there perfectly. me and my wife LOVE this thing because it's light, easy to move arround and VERY easy to setup and pack!guys, if you are looking for something that will be great for you and your kid, get it!the only disadvantage i got was the smell of plastic... but i set it up, left it standing there for about a week without my son being there and the smell was gone. in fact, mopping it with a wet soft cloth helped a big deal. have a great one! :)",5,1
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"I purchased this for my great nephew, as he travels to his Grammy's alot.  It's perfect size for travel, although his Grammy leaves it up for each time he comes to visit, making it a convenient size to tuck in a corner out of the way.  The bassinett part snaps to the top of the rails, making it very sturdy.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a Great Quality product for a Very Reasonable price.",5,1
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"I'm an Army wife, and when my son was 15-months-old my husband deployed for a year.  My son and I lived on the road, from one family's house to another.We flew with this and just checked it as-is.  Despite several flights, and flight changes, there was no problem with it.  Since it counts as a ""necessary"" item, it also checked for free along with a stroller and a car seat.  It didn't even get a rip in the bag/sack it comes in.  Perfect.My boy grew up sleeping in this, and it remained sturdy, stable, and safe until he was nearly two-years-old.The ""frills"" these things come with (diaper bag, changing table, mobile) are all cute and fine, but realize your personal, actual needs in buying these things.  My boy loved the mobile, but he quickly outgrew needing the ""baby"" features of this bed.  In our life it's primary function was as a portable-crib: and it was excellent for that.",5,1
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,Our grandson loves this pack n play and we like having the choice of being near him.  It set up easily and rolls freely around the home. We purchased a foam mattress to go on top of the mattress because of reviews from others saying that the pack n play had a hard thin mattress. We are glad we ordered the extra mattress.  The color is perfect and goes well with the family room.,5,1
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,They loved it and I loved the convenience of sending it direct.  Really an easy way to grant a perfect gift to my new grand neice.,5,1
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Margo","I love the Graco Pack 'n Play Playard!  It is well made and is very easy to set up and take down and doesn't take much room in either form.  Being the grand parents, our home doesn't have the room for a full size crib so this is the perfect solution for us.  I would totally recommend it for any family who needs a travel crib or play pen and anyone who needs an occasional infant bed.  The changing table is an added bonus!",5,1
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Margo","this pack n play is great!  our daughter is only 2 weeks old and already we have gotten lots of use from it.  it doesn't have all the bells and whistles like some of the more expensive models, but it is still a great product and it fits our needs perfectly.  I would recommend this to others.  my only complaint is that it doesn't fit through doorways, but even so, it collapses easily and is very mobile.  we plan to take it with us when traveling, too.",5,1
Graco Swept Frame Pack 'N Play Portable Playard with Bassinet and Changing Table in Graham,"I though this Playard was going to be darked color than really is. But when we saw the real color and compared with all the stuff we purchased, we were really exiting because the color is perfect. So, if you are going to purchase this Item, please notice that the color is more clear than its appear.",5,1
Graco Swept Frame Pack 'N Play Portable Playard with Bassinet and Changing Table in Graham,"Received this pack-n-play as a gift from my in-laws.  I was able to assemble myself in about 30 minutes, 7 1/2 months pregnant!  The colors are very neutral (perfect for boy OR girl) and match our bedroom very well... a nice change from the usual green or yellow.  The attached changing table is also very handy!",5,1
Kecci Shanghai Mommy Diaper Bag - Ruby,"I just got this bag the other day and I absolutley love it! It's the perfect size and I really like the print. It's not the ordinary cartoony bag that you see a lot of. It's stylish and very usable. Plus, mine got here in just a couple of days. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.",5,1
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,"These spoons are great!  The long handles are perfect for feeding, particularly early on.  Initially, I thought the spoon part was too deep, but actually it fit great into my daughter's mouth and made it easier to feed more liquidy foods.  Now that she's starting to use spoons to feed herself a bit, these aren't as easy for her to use, but I definitely recommend them early on.",5,1
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,"Bought these for my son a year ago. The design is perfect for toddlers learning to feed themselves. The deep spoon allows them to scoop and no spill as easily-which make meal time easier and fun. Liked them so much, we bought sets to keep at Grandma and Grandpa's too!",5,1
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,"I was looking for reasonably priced and quality BPA free spoons as I start up my daycare business and I feel that I found exactly what I was looking for in this product. The spoons arrived on time and in perfect condition. Two packages of six spoons were provided and the colors are bright and pretty. I LOVE Amazon for all of these reasons, they never disappoint!",5,1
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,I love these spoons and how easy it was for my daughter to use when feeding herself. Perfect to new learners and such an easy grip!,5,1

Infantino Shop &amp; Dine Deluxe Savvy Seat - Olive Mod,"My husband and I purchased this shopping cart cover and it has made shopping and dining so much easier for us. This cart cover is high quality and the perfect size. We have used it on shopping carts, restaurant high chairs, and the baby swing at the park. My son loves it because he feels secure in it and you can attach his toys to it. It does come with a couple of toys already that he likes to chew on as well. The colors are a little different than it shows online. The brown is pretty accurate, it has a hint of purple in it, and the green is, well, very green! I don't think it's ugly at all. Just expect the colors to be a little different. This cover is a great buy and you get the shipping for free. Not much else you can ask for!",5,1
Urban Single Jogging Stroller - Navy Dot,"We got this before our daughter was born, based on research and reviews.  She's now 8 months old, and she, her daddy and I all love it still.We live in a semi-urban, neighborhoody area (Cambridge, MA).  The sidewalks are often in bad shape due to the extreme winter weather.  For that matter, in the winter, they are often partially covered with snow and muck despite the fact they get shoveled.  This is a non-issue for this stroller.  The ride is unbelievably smooth.  The push is effortless.  It turns ""on a dime.""  I really can't emphasize enough how fabulously smooth and easy to push it is.  I've been trying out a lot of Maclaren-Quest-type luxe travel strollers lately, and I'm invariably disappointed in the push/ride because I'm so spoiled by this Mountain Buggy.The handlebar adjusts, which is a necessity if you ask me.  I've never hit my foot on the back (I'm 5'7), nor has my 6-foot-tall husband.  This is very important to me.  I tried some other strollers where this happened, and it's unacceptably annoying.  I can't believe anyone would put up with that, especially if they do a lot of walking with the stroller.  Not an issue with the Urban Single.It has a huge storage basket. I take it down about half a mile to the grocery store, load it down with groceries, then push it back uphill on the bumpy sidewalks, and it's easier than pushing our souped-up umbrella stroller (a Britax Blink) with nothing in it but the baby.  In addition to the storage basket, there are some handy pockets on the back of the basket, one with a zipper.  I use these all the time.We've also taken our beloved Mountain Buggy hiking on fire roads and it's no problem.  You can lock the front wheel in place for this or for jogging.  Fabulous.Yes, there are a few drawbacks, but these were easy compromises for me:No cup holder.  I don't want a cup holder, because I much prefer the Sunshine Kids attachable one.  It has loads of room for wallet, phone, kleenex, etc, a little zipper pocket inside, and TWO cup holders.  No problem.Sunshade could be bigger.  This one does sort of bother me.  If this stroller had a large sunshade you could ratchet down in front of baby when the sun is low on the horizon, it would approach complete perfection.Except that, the last thing is that it is quite large.  You feel a little obtrusive taking it into restaurants, but I do it anyway and try to stay out of the way and be courteous.  In a bigger city, this stroller would probably be simply too large for everyday use.  From the research I've done, it seems you can't get a narrow profile stroller that has all the things this Urban Single (same as Urban Jungle, for the record, according to the company) has.  Although, I'm intrigued with the new Mountain Buggy ""Swift.""  It looks like simply a mini-Urban Jungle!In short, I'm a huge fan of the Urban Single.  I feel like the company really thought about what parents need and what is troublesome for them in a stroller.  If its fabulous features are the ones that are important to you, and its few drawbacks are things you can compromise on or don't care about, you will be very, very happy with this stroller.",5,1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,My son is 4 months old and loves to bounce and play in his Jumperoo. It is so cute to watch him andI love that it grows with him. He is at the age of discovery and this is the perfect place for him to play grab chew and discover. I would highly recommend this to anyone!!! I wish I had one of these when my 3 older kids were babies. AND It was easy to assemble. Great Buy,5,1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,My 4 month old son loves this jumper. He's been in it since he was 2 months old. We were able to use it when he was that young because it has excellent back head support and we placed a box under his feet so he could reach. Now at 4 months he doesn't need the box and jumps for hours. My only gripe is that the toys don't fit in perfectly 2 of them I just leave off because it will fall off. It doesn't matter because all he cares about is jumping and we like the safety aspect of it. If you're baby is a jumper this is worth your money!,4,1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"We bought this jumperoo for our daughter for Christmas.  She's almost 6 mo. old and was starting to get bored with some of her other toys.  This was a GREAT pick!!!--3 height settings are perfect for her long torso--made of good quality, safe materials--music settings are not too loud to be annoying--diameter is large enough to keep our two labs from completely being in the way as they are eye level with her in it--most importantly, she LOVES it!",5,1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,My daughter LOVES this thing.  This is my 3rd child..how I wish I had this for my other two.  Perfect combo of an exersuacer and jumperoo.  She loves how the lights and sounds react to her movement.  Very easy to assemble as well as remove the seat when you need to wash it (after the occasional spit up or blow out).  She was ready and enjoying this by 4 months old.,5,1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,My baby loves it!  He is almost 5 months and is growing fast.  I wanted to get something that would entertain him while I cleaned the house because he cries every time I leave the room.this is the perfect distraction plus it helps him learn to balance and jump.,5,1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"We received this as a shower gift, and it was one of the best items that gets a lot of use now!  I am keeping this for all my kiddies that is for sure. My son is a big guy and loves alot of active play.  This thing is perfect for him, we put him in it when he was only 2 months old and at the time, he would just hang on it and touch the toys.  He would be okay in it for only about 5-10 minutes, and we figured this was one of those silly toys that wasn't going to get much use.  WRONG!  COME THE 3-4 months and he loves it!  Now at 5 months he loves it so much, it is part of his twice a day physical play routine!  Once in the morning while I make him some food, and once in the evening a bit before bedtime to ware him out. Which it definitely does.  After a good 15 minutes in this thing he is ready to sleep through the night!  He jumps and plays with the toys so much getting so excited it is so fun to see.  I know friends that purchase other comparable jumpers and they are either too high to the ground, all in one color which is not beneficial for their development, or too low to the ground. This has the best blend of everything! It is the perfect height from level 1 to 3, the music is fun NOT annoying, the spinning toys are very interesting to him.  The other reviewer mentioned the peekaboo tiger and spinning wheel are useless... I agree, they seem like an after thought but the rest of the toys on it are so much fun!  Definitely a top baby item.",5,1
"Bright Starts Around We Go Activity Station, Tropical Fun","When I had my first child ten years ago...THIS WAS NOT AVAILABLE! How did I ever do it????Now a days..parenting is sooo much easier! There are a lot of innovations for babies out there and THIS is absolutely THE BEST I've found! It entertains baby for a loooong while! (Perfect if you want to get quick things done around the house without the worry of losing your child!)Keeps baby moving and most importantly HAPPY! lots of things for her to do..never gets bored even though day after day she plays with it! GO FIGURE! But I won't question GENIUS! Which is exactly what this IS!!!! We both love the fact that she is not stationed and can move around the toy freely.So, If you are second guessing yourself about getting this...DON'T! I highly recommend it..even if you are hesitant about the price..if you do the research, like I did, you'll be happy to find out that this is actually VERY WELL PRICED for all you get! SO GO FOR IT!Oh also, doesn't need a huge amount of space, so you're good to go!",5,1

Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow - Sky Blue,"When I am not at home, this pillow serves as the PERFECT pillow for my wife.

I strongly suggest it for any expecting dads to surprise their significant others!!",5,1

"Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat, Midori","This car seat has been great through 2 babies.  It installed fairly easily (we have larger vehicles, so I'm not sure how it would go in a small car), and my kids were always as comfortable as you can expect in an infant seat.  I didn't use it to carry them around in too much, but I did put it into my Jeep Liberty stroller a lot, and it worked perfectly there.",5,1
"Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat, Midori","I have to get this message out because we have all grappled with which car seat to buy and let me tell you about how happy I am we chose the Chicco Keyfit 30.  My husband and I were walking out of the doctor's office yesterday, pushing our baby  in her Baby Trend Snap N Go Stroller with car seat in place, when we were suddenly struck by a Tahoe that decided to accelerate out of a parking space. We were thrown to ground and I witnessed my sweet preemie's car seat detach from the stroller, fly in the air, flip once, and slam to the ground. It was horrifying!!! We were all rushed by ambulance to a trauma center. My baby doesn't have a single scratch and is perfectly fine. It saved her life! Had she been held in my arms or in an umbrella stroller, she could have easily been killed. We are in a lot of pain from our own injuries but are absolutely thrilled that our baby survived this terrible ordeal. Just needed everyone to know how this car seat held up.",5,1
"Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat, Midori","This has been a great infant seat for our son.  When he was an infant, it was relatively easy to transport the seat in and out of the car with him in it (a little heavy, but not bad for short moves).  Now that he is heavier, we don't move the seat in and out of the car as much, but he is still comfortable in there, and all of the padded inserts were perfect for a reasonable amount of time.My only complaint is that our 10-month-old son, who is in the 75th percentile for both height (30 in) and weight (24 lbs) reached the height max (30 inches) before reaching the weight max (30 lbs).  I had imagined that it would last longer so that was my only disappointment!",5,1
Chicco Cortina KeyFit 30 Travel System in Adventure,"Excellent stroller!I bought it to use it with my newborn baby.The Keyfit30 worked fine up to 9 months.The stroller did perfect with no problem on streets, the beach and the farm.It fits perfect in our car (Fiat Siena '08) and the weight was enough to let have it a few seconds in hands (that happened because our flat had troubles with the elevator!!)There's no cons on this stroller because it was perfect all the time.It's a good option for a new baby. We just sell it to a friend and bought a Pliko P3 (the other side of the moon! hehehe)Let's see what will it be.",5,1
"Chicco Trevi Stroller, Adventure",I actually have the travel system and I love it. Chicco is exceptional! I will never use another infant seat and this stroller is great. Light weight yet but still heavy duty enough. Its the perfect size. Easy to fold and easy to clean. It has a good sized basket too. The only draw back is there is no parent area. Just a cupholder you can attach.,5,1
"Chicco Lullaby LX Playard, Adventure","We got this for our baby, we still havent had the chance to try it but we already assembled it, and i have to say, it was very easy to do it. My husband did the job on that part, and all he did was follow the manual which is pretty easy to understand. Before we got this playard, i did a lot of researching and reading because i didnt want to get something cheap that may put our baby in danger.  I am very familiar with the Chicco products because i am from Europe and it is valued as a number One brand for baby gear.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the prices here were even cheaper on the equipment then they were in Europe (i know them because i have had friends who bought it for their babies back there).Once i saw it and read the reviews i made up my mind very easily on this product.It arrived on time, well packed, with all the parts inside, assembly was very easy and it fits perfectly in the living room.With this playard you get more options .... the baby can sleep inside, there is a changing basinet, and later on when the baby is bigger it will be still useful for him to play inside and be safe while you do other things.I took off the changing bassinet because i plan on doing the changing part somewhere else, due to the position of the playard in our living room. But i will still use it, only on different location :-) The basinet is well padded and cushioned and it is steady to keep the baby safe, it even has a small belt to put around the baby so he wont roll over.The material of which its made is of a nice quality and easy to take off and wash in case of an accident.I also love the colors :-)As for the lullaby, we tried it, and it works, and we love it. The sound is not too loud, which is good, but still we put it in that direction to where the attachment will go to his feet, not to his head so he is not exposed to the sound directly. I dont think we will use the vibrating option because it will suck up the batteries right away and its still not too strong.As for the toys, we love them too, but i wont be using them right away, i will wait when he is little bit bigger.I recommend this product and i plan on getting the other gear from Chicco as well.",5,1
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump - Carry All,"This is the best pump ever.  Everything about it is A+.  I bought it after reading some reviews here and on Babycenter.com, then I found it for $165 which was even better.... I had never used an electric pump before (I used a manual pump for my first) and this pump was so easy to use.  And even easier to clean!  It fits almost any bottle (a little tight on the Avent bottles, but it does fit) and its very convenient to take along anywhere!  I like the fact that it isn't built into a bag.  I used it for 8 months, 3 times a day and it worked perfect each and every time.... and have since passed it along to a friend who uses it 3-4 times a day and the suction is as great as the first time!  Finally, the carry all bag is WONDERFUL!  Even now that I am not pumping anymore, the bag has become my every day diaper bag!  Its the perfect size!This pump truly is the perfect gift for any new mother and I would recommend it to anyone without any hesitation!",5,1
"Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer, Blue","When you're sleep deprived and nursing a baby every 2-3 hours, sometimes you forget the last time you've done something.  This timer was perfect to help keep track of not only how long it has been from the baby's last feeding, but also how long the feeding lasts.  Usually, I don't use the diaper changing button.  So when I start nursing, I press the button and it starts time.  When I'm done, I get to see how many minutes the baby actually nursed for. It has a very handy flashlight that I use every night to change their diaper and take peeks at them.  It's great because I don't have to turn on the main light at night and the flashlight gives me just enough light to see when I'm changing them and it still keeps the ""nightime"" environment.  I no longer nurse, but I still use the timer because I love the little flashlight and also I am able to see what time it is in the middle of the night.  I think this is a must have for all moms!",5,1
"Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer, Blue","Best 16 bucks I ever spent. This had made our lives so much easier. I only wish I bought it when our son was a newborn.  It makes &#34;shift changes&#34; a breeze. Especially with grandma who is hard of hearing. With the Itzbeen there are no misunderstandings about the last feeding and diaper change. The light is perfect for nighttime diaper changes, not too bright. My only complaint is the plastic clip. It broke the first day we had it. Not a big deal though. It doesn't affect how the product works.",5,1
Potty Chair Color: White,"We've had this potty for our son, and will soon be using it for our daughter - it's still in perfect condition, works great, it's small and portable if you need to take it with you anywhere. It is extremely easy to clean - all smooth surfaces that are very easy to wash/wipe, no nooks and crannies where germs can hide.",5,1
Mommy's Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,This does work.  It keeps my 3 year old from getting out.  But locking and unlocking the door can be a hassle.  And I think after a while he will figure out how to take it off the knob anyway.  Worth the price and would recommend but like a lot of these things not perfect.  Since he was going outside by himself the extra hassle with these is worth it though.  His safety is our biggest priority.,5,1
Mommy's Helper Door Knob Safety Cover,"i read the reviews and basically they may or may not work, depending on your door knob.  so buy one set. if it works, great.  if not, try another model.  these work great on our bathroom door, which is a round, smooth knob but has very thin depth.  it is impossible to use on our other doors where the knob is round, smooth but has thick depth.  it doesn't catch the knob so you can't open the door and it's really hard to take off.  i tried the safety 1st ones on that knobs that are thicker depth and it fits perfectly and we can open the door.  however, i think the safety 1st ones will be easy for my toddler to figure out.  only time will tell.",4,1
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary","Our 1.5 year old daughter always wants to do everything like big brother, so whenever he has a Capri Sun or juice box, she wants one too.  Of course the first few times she was given one she promptly toddled out of the kitchen, took one sip, and squeezed the pouch, spilling everywhere.Enter the Mommy's Helper Juice Box Buddy.  Works perfectly, and now our daughter can be just like big brother.  We've had no problems with it chipping, cracking, or breaking.  It goes right in the dish washer without problems.  Our daughter has dropped or thrown it plenty of times and no damage.We've not had any problem fitting juice boxes into it - though we stick mostly to Capri Sun pouches and Motts for Tots.  Your mileage may vary.  All in all, we're very satisfied.  This is a great item to throw into an order to bump you over the free shipping threshold.",5,1
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary",This product works great for my 20 month old. Fits almost all juice boxes. Easy to clean. This is perfect for toddlers who have just started drinking juice boxes!,5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Organic Cotton Swaddle, Cowboy","It was after I had my first child that I learned about the sleep sack. I called it a zipped up blanket. A friend from our church offered to give me hers for my baby. I was so excited when I got it, because it lessened the anxiety of wondering if my baby is overdress for the winter or under dressed for the summer nights.When I had my second child. I was already prepared with this very same sleep sack! It is such a relief to know your child is comfortable as they sleep.As a parent or child care giver you know that children don't keep their blankets on so the sleepsack is perfect in that it's a blanket and you can put it on your child. There are even some with the legs for older children!These blankets are soft and roomy and you can choose from preemie up to 5t! I was very excited to learn of the various sizes!Using the sleepsack will help create a safer sleep environment for your child. Especially for newborns under the risk of SIDS.I'm so glad I found this product and I would recommend it to every parent with children. This also makes a wonderful gift for a new mother!",5,1
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"Bought this to wrap around a drafting table that had bare wood edges so that resting my wrists/arm on the desk felt more comfortable. Really glad I bought this! It has withstood a few weeks of being on the desk, though for this relatively intensive contact I'd use a continuous strip of double-stick tape along the edge where I'm resting my arms instead of patches of tape as recommended by the installation instructions.This cushioning probably won't withstand kids tearing at it, but for the purpose of protecting from bumps on corners, it would work well I'm sure. I think the other negative reviews are a bit unreasonable - this is cushioning designed to be removable from furniture, so the double-stick tape won't last forever and may need to be replaced at some point a year or two down the line. You can't expect too much from tape glue! It has stayed on perfectly well on my desk though, and the cushioning is very high quality and soft.",4,1
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,I ordered the Kidkusion Todler Edge to wrap around the metal frame of my coffee table. It has worked fabulously and my crawling baby is no longer injuring herself as she explores the living room. It also blends in perfectly and was easy to install. I only wish the product sold in larger increments. I could have wrapped my whole house in this stuff!,5,1
Silver Cross Balmoral Pram - Navy,"We were given a Balmoral Pram at the birth of our daughter (1977), and it has been our favorite neighborhood walkabout for her and her children ever since.  It's not useful for trips or shopping, of course, since it can't be collapsed, and it would be too big for your trunk, even if it could be.It's mildly bouncy and jouncy on those great curved spring-steel slats the carrier rides on, and the babies LOVED that. Ordinarily it would put them to sleep, and if they wouldn't sleep, a mild increase in jouncing induced giggles... much preferred to crying.  The buckled leather straps that attach the slats to the carrier are subject to dry-rot, but easily replaceable in any harness shop.As an urban stroller for walks around the neighborhood or in the local park, it's absolutely perfect.  And the LOOKS you get!  Priceless.",5,1
Born Free Y-Cut Silicone Nipples- Twin Pack,Flow is perfect regular formula or pumped breastmilk for my 8 month old. She has no problem taking them. Great product. Highly recommend.,5,1
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","My six month old has been using these bottles since he was about 4 weeks old. We were using Avent and Dr. Brown bottles but heard about these that are BPA free. Yes they cost more but we would rather feel more secure in knowing that they won't leak anything harmful (possibly) into our baby's body. We have not had any problems with them and we have quite a few. We have both the 5oz and the 9oz as well as the glass ones (we got those accidentally but they are also good, just too heavy for now) and when we have had a leaking problem all you do is untwist them and twist them again and you are good. Excellent bottles. And our son does not have any more or less gas than he did with the Dr. Brown bottles. Avent was not a favorite although it does seem to be very popular. Of course if they were BPA free I might think they were ""okay"" but threw all of the ones we had away. Also we have the Avent bottle warmer and the Born Free bottles fit perfectly.",5,1
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"This bathtub organizer is awesome. You can slide it to fit any tub, and have the option to use the two dividers if you want to.  It is perfect for keeping baby toys, soaps, and shampoos at hand and uncluttered.  This also works for keeping pet bathing stuff at hand and nicely organized.  This is a must have for organizer freaks.  Very sturdy.  I like that its is made of plastic instead of metal because if it gets grimy you can toss it into the dishwasher and it won't rust.",5,1
"Kidz Delight Silly Sam the Talking Broom, Green",It is hard to find a sutible broom for kids these days. I love this broom. My son sweeps even more with this broom. Sam talks and encourages him... KayB Toys has it for $10 though... This one is perfect. Even at $20 he plays with this more than his more expensive toys...It's great...,5,1
"Graco Silhouette Pack 'N Play Playard, Carlisle",Perfect to start my newborn in! She sleeps in my room with me and a regular bassinet they grow out of so fast! So this bassinet is bigger so she can stay in longer. They changing table being connected is great to! It would of been too much for me to get up in the middle of the night and go to the baby room across the house to change her. Also I have a 2 year old that rooms right next to the baby room so the crying in the middle of the night would wake her up and that would not be good! Vibration and nature sounds are a plus also! Love the design too!,5,1
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","There are pros and cons to every wrap, and this one is no exception. That said, if I could only have one wrap, it would probably be the Moby Wrap; it does everything, and while it can be tougher to get used to, it's ultimately more flexible - both literally (softer) and in terms of use.Most reviews cover the basic pros and cons. I'll recap those, but I want to start by pointing out a couple of things I haven't seen mentioned elsewhere.First, I highly recommend getting a LIGHT color in the organic material. Reason being this carrier is warm to begin with; even a moderately warm day, in a black, heavy jersey material carrier your baby will get HOT. Second, babies get cradle cap - many of them quite a bit. Nothing like putting on your precious new carrier and putting in your precious new baby and 10 minutes later it looks like it has snowed on the carrier. (I foolishly got the black, thinking this color might incline my husband to wear it more.) And organic? Because chances are, your baby will chew on it like crazy after 3 months.Second, be aware that not every baby will like every carrier all the time, and not every carrier will work for every situation. My daughter hated the Moby - for the first month. My daughter loved the Ergo - after three months. My daughter plain hated the sling, but I think that was the fault of the poor material of the Seven Slings sling. (Go Maya Wrap.) A Moby is wonderful to put on in the morning and forget about, using off and on all day - making it perfect for at-home use or short use during errands - but as it can get bunched up and too loose in parts as the day goes on, and thus requiring re-wrapping, I find that for long walks I prefer the Ergo. Similarly, it's great because of the one-size-fits-all aspect - but if you're trading it back and forth frequently, a structured carrier like the Ergo is much easier to work with (no worries about dragging it on the ground at the park during the re-tying phase). A squirmy baby might be easier in the Ergo (no pulling loose panels), but a colicky baby seems to do better in the more confining, incredibly soft Moby. You never think about how stiff fabric can be until you're holding it against a newborn; that's one of my favorite aspects of the Moby. It felt like an extension of me, almost - like I'd popped her inside my shirt. It's very similar to feeling pregnant again, only much less hard on the ligaments!So although I certainly didn't want to hear it, the truth is most people need at least two kinds of wraps, maybe three.  And keep in mind that babies have opinions and may love or hate a specific carrier depending on the day.To recap some of those other frequently mentioned cons and pros:CONS:- less structured, more easily loosened & requiring retying; not as good for long-term wear or long walks (which isn't to say it isn't good for wearing for hours at a time puttering around in the house; just not ideal for fast-paced walking in the woods, in my experience)- no back support like a structured carrier- can overheat baby in summer (or even late spring, depending on your climate)- requires practice and watching a lot of videos to learn how to wrap (better yet, join a mom's group and ask someone to help you!)- bulky, if you intend to try to carry it in your purse (better to just wear it out)PROS:- extremely secure hold - comparable to a more structured carrier, unlike slings, making it possible (halleluia!) to have two functional hands; makes grocery shopping, house cleaning, even a little cooking possible (prep work, cold foods)- spreads out the weight on your body well; no shoulder pain- soft, soft, soft- buy organic, perfect when your baby starts chewing on everything (my baby did at 3 months)- light color camouflages dandruff- excellent at keeping baby warm- womb-like tightness exceptionally useful for crying babies (essentially works as swaddling)- can breastfeed in with practice- one size fits all- multiple wrap styles - critical for the picky baby- no starter weight limit; you can use it straight out of the hospital- easy to store; just hang folded a few times on a hanger (unlike the bulky structured carriers that take up all the space in your closet)- super easy to clean - toss it in the laundry, no parts to remove- no parts to lose",4,1
Joovy Big Caboose Stand-On Tandem Triple Stroller Black,"I have owned this stroller for about a year, and we love it! My kids are 5,4, and 1 and this meets our needs perfectly. It is a triple stroller, so expect it to be BIG. However, it handles really well. It is much easier to maneuver than my duoglider double stroller. It it easier when the lightest child rides in the front seat. My only complaint is that it doesn't fit in my mid size suv without putting a third row seat down so use the measurements provided if this is a concern. Overall, its a great product, good quality, and a nice look. I am now addicted to Joovy products and love them all!",4,1
Child's Infant Baby Turtle Halloween Costume (12 Months),"We got this for our almost 1 year old to make a ninja turtle costume out of. It worked perfectly..The shell is a larger size than the costume it seems because even past 2 years old, my son wears his turtle shelll ( sort of like a security blanket. lol ) and it still has room to grow!I would suggest this as a regular turtle costume or for a little provision and creativity, like we did :)Also want to add.. the hood part is really tight :/",4,1
Hand Drum with Mallet,"Ok, for being simply made this drum is awesome. Just what my kids wanted to play with. Lightweight, sturdy, and inexpensive. Perfect toy and great way for child to release energy. Received the green drum only 3 days after payment, also. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!",5,1
"Protect-a-Bub Single Compact Sunshade, Black","This is easy to ""install"" - and the protection is perfect.  My son is 4 months old, and isn't using sunblock, so this has been a lifesaver!  We love it.  The only con is that you have to untie it every single time you want to fold the stroller...but really, what would the alternative be...it's not like there is a stroller out there that can offer this much protection.  Buy it - you'll love it!",5,1
Graco Diaper Bag Ionic,"I bought this after my old diaper bag's zipper broke. I am incredibly pleased with this product.The bag is far more spacious than I thought it would be, and the larger bag is much more attractive than I was expecting. The smaller bag is the reason I gave 4/5 stars. The silver mesh part on the flap (shown in picture) is rather unattractive in my opinion. It would look much better if it was only the light blue & black. The smaller bag is also someone difficult to remove from the larger bag. The extra strap does make it much easier to take & go when you need to run a fast errand and don't want to tote around a large bag.My favorite part is the convenient pockets inside of the large bag. It has a nice build in zipper bag to hold items (perfect fit for clean diapers so they don't get smooshed under everything. That was a big problem I've had with other diaper bags.)",4,1

The Original Tummy Tub Baby Bath - Clear,"The Tummy Tub is a unique baby bath. It looks a little like a bucket but its deeper and taller. What makes it better is that you can set it on the floor, on the table, or just about anywhere. There's no bending so it isn't hard on your back. Your baby is held in an upright position, even if they can't sit up yet.  Plus it will remind your little one of their time in the womb. It is really one of the coolest baby tubs I have come across to date. I wish it had when Willow was a newborn, but even now at seven months, she enjoyed her bath more than she ever had before.  To make the Tummy Tub even more convenient, add the stool and make it the perfect height to clean the baby while seated in a chair.",5,1

Elegant Baby Photo Album- ABC,"I bought this album a little hesitant because other reviewers claimed it was closer to yellow than cream.  When the item arrived I was pleasantly surprised because it looked exactly like the picture to me.  It is beautiful and well made.  I thought I had read that it held 80 photos, but mine holds 90 photos.  It is perfect for my favorite photos of my daughters first year of life.

Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump,"I originally registered for this pump after reading so many positive reviews.  I'm taking a year off of work to stay at home with my baby so I knew that my pumping needs would be just the occasional bottle for babysitters and daddy.  My friends all told me I was totally insane for not getting an electric double pump and, out of what I think was incredulity at the fact that I never did, my sister-in-law lent me her Medela Pump In Style after my kiddo was born.  I started pumping when my son was about three weeks old and ... I haaaaaaaaated it.  I tried using smaller and larger breast shells, tried fiddling with the suction intensity, tried just using the nipple stimulation mode, etc.  Supply wasn't my problem; I could get 4-5 oz per breast.  I was just uncomfortable the whole time.  Turns out my son was an awesome sleeper at night from one month of age (don't hate me) so I was having to pump every morning just to keep from exploding.  After a month of still despising my early morning pumping sessions, I went ahead and ordered this pump.(the clouds part and angels sing)First of all, the silicone sleeve that goes over the breast shell is super comfortable.  The shell IS a little smaller than the Medela standard size, more like a 24 mm shell, although I suppose you could just not use the silicone sleeve if you need a little more room for your nipple.Secondly, I like being able to control the frequency and intensity of suction.  I can much more easily replicate my son's sucking rhythm (more frequent with less pull) than the Pump in Style did (less frequent, more pull).Thirdly, although I expected my hand to get tired, it doesn't.  I do have large-ish hands so that may make a difference, and I'm also pumping for 15 minutes MAX.  If you're pumping for more like 30 minutes, I can see how your grip might wear out.  (BTW, I grip the neck of the bottle with my thumb and palm and use all four fingers on the lever.  I'm also pumping into 8oz glass bottles which weigh significantly more than plastic but my hands still don't hurt.)So after gushing to my husband about what a revelation this pump was to me, he (being the engineery type he is) suggested I do a head-to-head comparison with the electric pump.  Results?  I was able to pump 7 oz from the Lansinoh side in 14 minutes.  During that same time, I got 5 1/2 oz from the P-in-S side.  It took another 6 minutes to pump that last 1 1/2 oz from the P-in-S side.  I believe being able to more accurately mimic my son's rhythm and suction with the manual pump makes a huge difference.  I'll be returning my sister-in-law's pump to her.Now for the negatives (are there negatives?  Well of course there are.):More parts.  More parts to clean and dry and assemble and disassemble than the Medela pump.  I still only pump once or twice a day, so this is not a big deal for me, but if you are pumping several times a day I can't imagine the parts would have time to air-dry in between each session.It's not a workhorse pump.  If I were pumping for a baby in daycare, I honestly can't conceive of using just this.  I'd need a hospital-grade pump so I could fiddle with rhythm and suction.  And so that I didn't develop carpal-tunnel syndrome.Some other reviewers have noted that it starts to squeak after a few months of use.  I haven't had it long enough to notice this issue; thus far, the sound of the milk hitting the bottom of the bottle is the loudest noise this thing makes.  I will report back if it starts to squeak on me.This pump fits my need perfectly, and it's just a bonus that it's lightweight and easy to travel with (I can pump in the car on road trips!) AND nearly silent so I can pump while my son is asleep without waking him.*EDIT June 27, 2011*  After owning and using this pump for two months, I still love love love it.  I HAVE heard an occasional squeak now and again and it comes from the pressure point where the lever meets the plastic body.  It doesn't happen every time, and it seems to happen when: a) the parts aren't fully dry, b) it's really humid in my house, or c) if I stick the whole bottle + pump contraption directly into the fridge and then take it out later to continue to pump.  In other words, humidity seems to be a big factor in the squeak.  Often if I change my grip slightly and squeeze a bit farther down on the lever it will go away.  Taking it apart and giving it a thorough clean helps prevent the squeaks, too.",5,1
Medela Pump in Style and New Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump Tubing - Pack of 2,"I ordered this set of tubes and the Medela Breastpump Accessory Set from this company, and both arrived together-2 days before their expected shipping date. I am very happy with the product as well. I had read some reviews about people having faulty tubing or other items from this seller,  but mine fit my Pump in Style Backpack perfectly! So, you definitely have to make sure you have the right tubes for your pump, but other than that, if you have any of the newer Pump in Style pumps, you should be fine ordering these! I highly recommend these and from this seller.",5,1
Tadpoles Triple Layer Tulle Crib Skirt in White,"This is a very cute crib bedskirt / dust ruffle right out of the package.  It's just as described.  It fit the crib perfectly.  Only one slight thing you may wish to be aware of:  It doesn't go all the way to the ground.  Now, that could be because our crib mattress is set on the higher of two settings.  Yours may be lower to the ground and therefore the duster would reach.  Either way, it's still super cute and adds to the nursery.  Also, it's fairly sheer.  You have the 2 sheer / tulle ruffles and then a white thin nylon fabric behind them, but it is also fairly sheer and see through.  Not a problem if you're not attempting to hide or store anything under the crib.  Worth the money in my book.",4,1
Cardinal Gates Stairway Special Aluminum Gate in White,"This baby gate fit my needs perfectly.  I had been looking for a while and took a chance on this one.  The top of my stairway, where this gate is installed, has thick footboards and chair rail.  There is also not enough room to install a pressure gate due to lack of wall space at the top of the stairs.  A pressure gate wouldn't fit anyways due to my height restrictions to be inbetween the chair rail and footboards.  I was able to install the hinged end of the gate at 90-degrees to the gate in the closed position.  I had to add strip of 1x2 lumber to the clasp end of the gate (mounted on the wall).  This ensured that the gate clasp clears a very close by doorway trim.  As i said, i installed the gate hinge at a 90-degree angle, so this also allows me to swing the gate to a 'full open' position.  I added a small hook on the wall to keep the gate in its open position.  So in short, the gate was installed in a very tight location that required much attention to detail for all the angles required at the top of my stair well.  This gate exceeded my expectations and has provided a very strudy solution for our needs.  I would recommend this gate to a friend, and i will be purchasing a second gate to go outside on our back deck installed much like as shown in the picture.  The gate itself was very easy to install (however, i did only recieve directions in French - there were enough pictures and letters/numbers to guide me).  The next installation will be a snap!",5,1
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","I paid a lot of money to get two more additional gates that are for smaller doors (older houses have smaller widths).  So, what I did was not use the side piece on the smaller doors and was able to adjust the tension rod so that it worked perfectly and it just fits between the door rim on the side of the wall.  On the newer part of the house, of course, it worked perfectly.The trick is to make sure to level the top piece and then the bottom should fall into place.  If it's not level, then it will either be too tight or too loose when opening it up.I ended up buying 2 more (for a total of 4) because they contain tension rods pieces and I didn't have to drill into my wall like the expensive ones I ordered for my smaller doors.Lastly, Amazon's price is a lot less that the pet store's price.  So, if you can wait a few days, it's totally worth it to save money because the price difference is a lot. Also, the spaces between the bars are just small enough that my teeny tiny puppy cannot get through the openings.",5,1
"UPPAbaby Vista Bassinet Stand, White","If you're going to spend the money on an UppaBaby Vista stroller, you might as well purchase the bassinet stand.  The bassinet fits perfectly on the stand and allows us to keep the baby in our room at night or we can move the stand around the house while still keeping her in the bassinet.  I also like that I can continue to use the stand in the future as a hamper (need to purchase the linen insert, of course).  I love UppaBaby products and find that they offer versatility, flexibility and style.  Although they are pricey, you pay for what you get and I believe they sell a great product.  I haven't had to use their Customer Service yet, but I hear that it's a hassle free experience.",5,1

Baby's My First Photo Album of Family &amp; Friends,"We bought this book for my young son (when he was around 8 months old), and filled every page with pictures of his mom and I, his grandparents, aunts, uncles, and all of his favorite people on earth. Something for him to have and look at when his mom and I are at work and he is missing his family. This book is worth every single penny it costs a million times over each time he opens it and points to the pictures and laughs and smiles when he sees the people who love him.The book is well designed. The material for the covers is easy to wipe clean if anything gets on it. The pages are very secure and it would be nearly impossible for our son (who is now currently 14 months old) to ever be able to get into it and remove the pictures from the pages himself. My one and only complaint is that the clear plastic material used for each page doesn't remain perfectly flat, and also reflects back a lot of glare, making it hard to see under very bright direct light at times. But it doesn't seem to stop my son from being able to recognize and get excited by the people he sees in the pictures inside. It was a tough choice but I had to remove a star for this, since I feel like it is a problem that could easily be solved by the manufacturer if they so choose.Overall though, this is one of those products where I find myself constantly recommending it to all of the other parents we know. It's worth it for a unique product; it offers a lot of improvements that make it more suitable for a young child above and beyond anything I've found in any other commercially available photo album.",4,1
Baby's My First Photo Album of Family &amp; Friends,Bought two for each of my grandsons (2yrs old). They both live in different state from me and this is a perfect way to keep us in touch. I mail a box each month and add new photos each time. Pages stuck a little but it's a good price.,4,1
Totseat - Stripe in Blue,"The Totseat is great!  My parents had an old high chair from my childhood that they wanted to clean up and use for my daughter when we came to visit, but the only problem was that the old straps where long broken.  I purchased the totseat to allow me to use the highchair, but still keep my daughter secure.  It was the perfect solution!  The totseat is very adjustable, it can accommodate all kinds of chairs, and is very handy for visiting.  It washes up nice too...always important for something involved with baby feeding!",5,1
Totseat - Stripe in Blue,"Perfect to have your baby join the meal. Easy to use, clean, and carry and the patterns are cute. Definitely helps out when a place does not have high chairs.",5,1
Totseat - Stripe in Blue,"I bought this seat just before leaving for vacation.  I was worried my 1 year old wouldn't like it, but it worked perfectly.  He was comfortable and safe and I was a happy mommy!  He looked cute too and everyone thought it was great.  I'm mad at myself though, I forgot the stap for backless chairs and the tote case at the vacation house!  Maybe it would help if the extra strap buttoned or looped onto the main portion of the seat so you can't loose it if you don't use it...  But either way, this seat is so worth it and works with just about any chair.  I highly recommend it.",5,1
Micro V.2 Red/Black,"Silver Cross has been in the stroller (pram/pushchair) business for over a century and this stoller shows its years of experience.  We have two toddlers, 17 mos (22lbs) and 36 months (38lbs).  I have arthritis and weak wrists, so had to purchase the lightest strollers possible.  When we travel, just like what Rick Steves (Europe) suggests, I always say ""every ounce counts.""  This stroller has gone with us all over Europe and all over the United States.  The Silver Cross Micro is lighter than the Maclaren Volo, has nicer seat and head cushioning for naps (Volo has none), better buckles (Maclaren buckles hurt my hands), and much better and bigger wheels.  Our Volo can't go over the rough sidewalks in our neighborhood, but the Silver Cross easily can as it has 6 inch wheels as compared to the tiny 4 inch wheels on the Volo.  The Silver Cross has more comfort features than the Volo, and still weighs less than the Volo (I think a pound less).  We can walk at top speeds because of the Micro's long handles and good size wheels, unlike the Combi with the short handle and rear wheels placed so that your feet will run into them.We do wear these Micro strollers out and have been through four of them now.  Replaced them because back wheels eventually go flat after about 500 miles of walking and then becomes hard to steer at that point (we walk about 2-3 miles a day).  We have other strollers too like the Peg Perego Aria (single and double), and the double BOB Ironman and the Phil and Teds single with double seat in back.  I tried all the other strollers within the stores around the area too and some I really like, for example, the Combi Cortina (but at 23lbs, no way can I lift that out of the car every day!!!).  Over 10 lbs for a stroller is too heavy for me on a daily basis.  I tried the Bugaboo also (aka, ""the $1000 stroller"") and couldn't believe what a hassle that was to fold up, and its big rear rubber wheels run into everything when trying to navigate through a crowded store.  My boy at 24 months was too tall for the Bugaboo (he's now 38 inches tall, but still fits in the Micro).  With the Silver Cross Micro, we can throw two of them into back of our Highlander, with room left for our Radio Flyer Pathfinder wagon and tricycle that they love for taking into the playgrounds.My son enjoys napping in the Micro and it has comfy head support on the sides.  Whenever he has a melt-down, like in a restaurant, his ""security blanket"" is his Micro stroller.  He will even ask us to go to the car to get the stroller and bring it into a restaurant (it calms him to sit in it, and since the stroller is so small, we can park it next to our table in a crowded restaurant without getting in anyone's way).  We even did this at fancy restaurants in Paris last year, including a formal dinner in a palace.When napping, my daughter's head tends to fall forward in the stroller, but I can reposition her head and she's fine.  It's not the best napping position in my opinion, but my kids seem to like it. Basically, the stroller seat is like a hammock that is very comfortable for most kids, although young kids look slouched.  We run our son to the train every day in it (yes, we use it daily as a jogging stoller as well), where we fold it up quickly and hop aboard the commuter train.Pros: 1) lightest weight stroller I've found; 2) good handle height for tall people; 3) aluminum construction (light); 4) ergonomic handles angled for comfort; 5) padded seat and head rest; 6) nice cushioning on handles (not slimy like Combi); 7) narrow enough so goes through crowded spaces easily; 8) easy to fold with one hand while carrying child in other; 9) easy to remove and wash seat cushion; 10) easy for kids to get in an out of themselves; 11) easy step on brakes for each back wheel (Maclaren Volo has terrible side switch wheel locks that take extra time to lock); 12) lockable front wheels for going over cobble stones (like we did in Europe) and over gravel roads; 13) 5-point harness with buckle that doesn't pinch or hurt hands like Maclaren and many others make. 14) New model has storage pocket on back of seat (holds a bottle, cell phone and keys).Cons: 1) Small sunshade (we attached a Rayshade which worked perfectly for when they were infants - now they just wear sun hats); 2) back wheels go bald after about 500 miles of walking; 3) if hang diaper bag on back - stroller will tip over after removing child; 4) no cupholder or snack tray (we use high chairs at destinations and I put my water bottle in basket underneath and I don't walk with Lattes).  5) My daughter, who is much smaller than my son as to torso size, didn't really fit well in the stroller until one year of age because the shoulder harness straps were too high for her, although supposed to be for six months and up.Suggestions to company for improvement: bottle holder between handle bars (made of nylon like on Combi's carseat stroller, not of hard plastic), higher endurance or rubber tires for rear wheels where child's weight wears them out (front ones don't carry the weight of child), adjustable straps with two stages instead of just one height).  3) Add more reflective material (we attached on a red flashing bike light for when navigating busy streets at night for safety).  4) Canopy trim should be black in color as this part gets dirty (our pink Micro in particular).  5) Add more fun fabrics PLEASE like polka dots or stripes or something.  6) Sturdier break levers (we broke one stepping on it too hard).Favorite diaper bag to go with this stroller is from the Container store: Mesh tote bag ($12) that hangs perfectly over handles and is see-through, so can find what you need fast.  Weighs maybe 2 ounces, its so light weight.  Also we attach a snap-on neoprene bottle insulator to the handle to carry a bottle or sippy cup.Anyway, this is the best stroller for every day use that I can find for children ages 9 months-4 years, until 40 lbs.  Never seen it at a Babies R Us store, where we go to bi-weekly, so had to order on-line (LittleFolks.com is where we bought our last couple of Silver Cross Micros).",4,1
"Sunshine Kids Dry Seat Pad, Grey",We needed something to protect my son's car seat from potty training mishaps. This is perfect! Really beats having to remove and wash the car seat cover each time!,5,1
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner for Highchairs, Blue",We love it! It's perfect! Great little suction cup prevent it from going woosh off the table.  It rolls up pretty small so its easy to pack and take along. We also have the bib and love that too!  Its so great that you can just wash them and they are ready to go later.,5,1
"NUK 2 Pack Replacement valves Spill Proof Cup, Colors May Vary",Perfect match. Ordered on Sunday and Wednesday it was here. Exactly what I ordered and nothing else! If u need replacements this is it,5,1
"NUK 2 Pack Replacement valves Spill Proof Cup, Colors May Vary","It's a Catch-22 situation. I am giving these things five stars because we needed replacements and lo, there they are, for sale. They fit the cups we bought them for--and they suit their purpose perfectly. However, we have to lodge our complaint that these cups should need replacements in the first place. These valves collect dirt, and sometimes black mold if you don't wash them separately from the cup, and even if you put them in the dishwasher on sterilization mode. I have used little bottle brushes, pipe cleaners, and sprayed them with vinegar or hydrogen peroxide in order to clean them. I finally tossed them and bought these new ones. I called the company to tell them that their valves get moldy over time and they sent me two new ones for free. I guess the message is---replace when necessary. It's cheaper than buying new cups.",5,1
Munchkin Deluxe Drying Rack,"This is small enough for my little kitchen.  I use it to dry a few bowls, cups, spoons,and small containers.  It is perfect for me since I mainly nurse so don't have many bottles.",5,1

"Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors May Vary","I registered for these for my baby shower.  We are a traveling family, both my husband and I commute to our jobs daily.  Our little one even commutes to daycare.  On top of that I don't think we have had a weekend since he was born that we weren't on the road doing something.  Needless, to say this is a life saver.  I will measure out his formula and then take a few bottles with us.  I keep a case of bottle water in our truck.  When it is feeding time I just the formula dispenser and pour it into the bottle.  It's wonderful!  It's small size is perfect it will fit any where.  The only draw back to this item is that sometimes the formula will shift into another compartment of the dispenser.",4,1
"Munchkin Bottle and Nipple Brush, Colors May Vary","I like that it has a soft part on top to help get residue off. The bristles work well for tough stuff, and the nipple brush is the perfect size.",5,1
"Munchkin Bottle and Nipple Brush, Colors May Vary","I LOVE this design!! The sponge at the top gets into the bottom of larger bottles and cleans wonderfully! While I read the reviews on the nipple brush, I haven't noticed any issues after 2 mos of use. I wash bottles by hand 2 times a day and use this every time. The only down side is that I have had to replace it 2X already because the sponge breaks apart and the 4 parts of the X it creates break off. If that design flaw could be fixed, it would be PERFECT!!",4,1
Soho French Sage Toile Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"I bought this for my grand baby nursery.  I have 2 grand babies, boy and girl, so I was looking for something unise.  This was perfect for my use and for the price, however it is a little flimsy.  I wasnt looking for WOW and expensive so you get what you pay for.",4,1
BOB Attachment Pin and Lanyard 2000 10 pack,"I was a little worried that these wouldn't work with my old BOB trailer since I bought it ten years ago, but the design hasn't changed and they fit perfectly. Now I have more than I anticipate ever needing, but I'm glad to have some extra.Also, note that while Amazon considers this a ""baby product"" I bought the pins for my bicycle trailer, not for a stroller. I don't know if they are useful for any of the stollers or not (what would they be for?) but they are just what you need for the trailers.",5,1
"Nuby 4 Pack Spoon and Fork, Colors May Vary","I have been trying many kinds of toddler spoons and forks, from fancy brands to target brand, and Nuby is one of our favorite for toddlers. The design makes it easy for little hands to grab and hold on. Both of my kids use these started around 12m old, and can use them to put food into their mouths slowly around 14-15m. Also, these spoons and forks are very durable, one of the sets we have are from 4 years ago (from my older son), and now my 18m daughter uses them just like all those new ones I got for her.The depth of the curve and the width of the spoon and fork are PERFECT for toddler's mouth size while hold on a good amount of food. The fork doesn't really function like a fork for food with harder texture, but that doesn't bother me- we can't expect a fork to be safe for toddlers and at the same time expect it to perform like an adult fork. My kids use these forks to pick up rice, noodles, pasta, and they work great. For kids under 2 years old, I am very satisfied with these spoons and forks.",5,1
Britax Diplomat Convertible Car Seat Taylor,"I couldn't be happier with my purchase of this carseat. I love everything about it from the fabric, to the styling, to the fit in the car. This carseat had by far one of the best designs in latch buckles and in harness adjustment.  Plus the added safety of the side impact eased my mind.  I know it costs a lot but those coupons you earn can help out. It was a perfect fit for my 9 month old that grew out of her carrier carseat (big girl). To top it off it arrived a month earlier than expected...which was awesome because I don't think my daughter would've made it much longer in her old seat.",5,1
"Munchkin Deluxe Dishwasher Basket, Colors May Vary",I have the Dr Browns wide neck bottles and was having a hard time finding something to wash them in.  This basket was perfect for all of the normal and odd shaped parts!,5,1
"Moby Wrap UV SPF 50+ 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Sand",The wrap is perfect and lightweight.  The fabric and wrapping process securely holds my baby and the print is visually calming.  It comes out of the dryer ready to go.  The picture diagrams in the instruction book are great for sleep deprived moms or caregivers.  I used this in 80+  temps and we were both comfortable.,5,1
"Moby Wrap UV SPF 50+ 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Sand","My husband and I agreed: if we had to choose one item that we really couldn't do without since having our baby 2 months ago, it's our Moby wrap!Our first week home from the hospital, we were able to go out to lunch with the baby wrapped up and completely covered in the Moby. It's given us a sense of freedom that we never thought we could have once she was born, because we can comfortably take her anywhere that we want to go. I can't count how many times I've gone out to eat or shopping with her wrapped up on me!It might be because she's so used to it now, but it's so comfortable for her, she falls asleep almost immediately once she's in it. And, perhaps even more importantly, my husband and I can both wear her in it for hours on end without any back pain. I use it at least once a day, just around the house, when she's getting overtired or overstimulated... She fights me for a second, and then falls right to sleep.It's easy to use once you've done it a couple of times... Getting the feel for the perfect tightness takes about a week of using it. Once you figure out that sweet spot, though... It's just perfect.We also have an Ergo carrier with an infant insert, and even though the Ergo might be a little more sturdy for walking long distances, our baby really doesn't like it nearly as much, and it's really not as comfortable as the Moby.",5,1
"Swing Baby Toddler S-13R includes (front Chain S-11 $3.49 Value) Half Bucket Seat Swing (no Rope), RED",1-2- and 3 year olds love the swing.  Its always a race to see who swings first.  I am so glad to have found the perfect gift for the grandkids.,4,1

NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"At my first impression of this product, I was impressed by the functionality and quality of it. It feels very solid and durable and it is easy to use. The Instructions are fairly clear and after trying 3 different products to monitor our baby I am very pleased with the performance of this one. The sound is crisp and the audio transmitter microphone is very sensitive; this in collaboration with a loud volume option makes this monitor perfect for us and our baby. Haven't had it for very long so I cannot comment on the longevity of the product but strait out of the gate, it's a good one.",5,1
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"We loved it so much, we bought a second one of these to monitor our second child. We've been using our first one every night for 3.5 years and it still works perfectly. Range is fantastic...we can go to the neighbors house and still monitor our little ones. Every once in a while, we get a little interference from our laptop but we just move the receiver a few feet and it's fine. You can't ask for more for the price. Thumbs up on this.",5,1

"Bedtime Originals Travel Time 4-Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set , Blue","I spent months debating on the type of bedding set to buy. Looking out for cheaper deals or specials to get a matching bumper, valance and quilt, but I kept being drawn back to the Travel Time design. I was definitely not disappointed in buying this! It is a lovely bright design and it looks as good in reality as it does in the pictures. The quality of fabric is good and the bumper stays upright and doesn't sag on the cot. My main worry was that it wouldn't fit my Cot. We have the Irish/UK sized 'cotbed'. The sheet fits perfectly on the mattress, however the bumper length is slightly shorter than the length of the cotbed by about 5cm, but the width is correct. The shorter length does not really cause any problems, i just have it tied across the cotwith a slight gap between one end of the bumper and the cot end. We have hung the quilt on the wall - the quilt has hidden fabric loops at one end to allow a string or rod to be inserted to allow hanging.",5,1
Serta Nightstar Extra Firm Crib Mattress,"This mattress was a great purchase, the price was right and it's very convenient to not have to go to the store for this big lug. Fit into the crib (Graco Lauren crib by LaJobi) perfectly and the baby sleeps very well. No complaints, we are happy!",5,1

"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","This toy attaches perfectly to my Graco Lauren changing table. I've been using it since my son was 4 weeks old and it was great to see his motor skills develop as he begun to bat at the toys. Now that he is a lot more mobile and squirmy, the toy is perfect for keeping him still and distracted during diaper changes. We sometimes attach it to our stroller when we go on trips. However, we've gotten the best use on the changing table. I highly recommend this toy!",5,1
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","I was skeptical of this item but it has far surpassed my expectations!  Occupies my 3 month old perfectly and is truly versatile.  We have used it on her bassinet, baby papasan chair, car seat and pack and play.  She is my fourth child so unfortunately I can't entertain her every minute...but she doesn't seem to mind as long as she has this!  Well worth the price.",5,1
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll",I bought this for my niece and her baby.  It fits perfectly and is so versatile.  Her son is entertained for hours cooing and laughing with his little play things. This also fits perfectly on stroller.This is much nicer than pictured and well worth the money. I am going to buy another one for my cousin's 3 month old.,5,1

"JJ Cole Collections Diaper Caddy, Blue Stripe","I registered for this caddy here on amazon.com and it has become one of my favorite baby items. I live in a two-story house and the baby's room is upstairs. I have this caddy downstairs and use it more frequently then my actual changing table. I use the changing mat on my couch as a ""changing table."" My baby is now 5 months old and this is one of the few items I have used every day since he came home from the hospital. It is perfect for all your diaper essentials! It has perfect slot for your wipes, enough space for about 15 diapers, an easy to wipe changing pad and a small drawer for destin or your A&D cream. Highly recommend.",5,1
"JJ Cole Collections Diaper Caddy, Blue Stripe","I purchased this product when my first son was born and have now purchased another for our new baby.  It works great to organize the diapers and the wipes, along with all those little essentials.  A huggies wipes container first perfectly in the wipes spot to hold them contained (whether you choose to use huggies or not, we don't).  At first we just placed it on the changing table next to the pad but now that our first son is too big for that, we bring it down on the floor or to other parts of the home, if needed.  You can fit a ton of small newborn diapers in here.  Once bigger, even at size 5 now, I can fit an entire row from the diaper box in the back.  The pad is easy to fold and easy to clean.  And when we are done with diapers, I'll just use it to store some crafts.  It's very sturdy and has held up extremely well.",5,1

Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy,"This is perfect for my stroller. I have an UPPA baby Vista stroller which does not come with this type of accessory.

Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy,"I purchased the Buggy Buddy to go with my new Graco IPO stroller.  It attaches to individual handles or a single handlebar.  The pictures aren't clear enough to show that the cup/bottle holders expand to hold many different sizes and it holds them snuggly.  There is a zipper pocket for keys, cell phone, etc. and a decent amount of open space for whatever else you need.  My stroller still folds easily with the Buggy Buddy attached.  Perfect solution for smaller strollers w/out a parent tray.",5,1
Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy,This is a great organizer for stroller. I have a Baby Jogger City Mini and it fit perfectly. I turned mine so the Diono words are facing the stroller.

It also has a zippered pocket inside for ID and money,5,1
Graco Travel Lite Table Chair Tango in the Tongo,"This was perfect for our small kitchen, better than a highchair, our table has big skirt and the frame under the table made it hard to fit most other clip on chairs.  We orderedChicco Caddy Hook On Chair Redfrist but returned it because the brackets were too long to work with our set up.  I think the graco one is better because it is super easy to clean, I put the tray in the dishwasher and the seat doesn't have any nooks and crannies.  Our table skirt is about two inches deep and the baby's legs fit under no problem.",5,1
Baby Bath Tub Ring Seat New in Box By KETER - Blue Best Price,"This bath seat is perfect for little ones, starting with those who are not quite able to sit on their own yet. It makes bath time much easier when you don't have to hold your baby the entire time while bathing him/her.",5,1
Baby Bath Tub Ring Seat New in Box By KETER - Blue Best Price,"1. If you have a tub with no-slip grip the suction cups WILL NOT STICK. My tub has a smooth bottom so the cups work well. The cups aren't perfect. Once when she was sitting in it and leaning quite a bit one of the cups started to come up from the tub. Obviously, you can't just leave your kid in the tub and walk away so it's not really an issue for us. I was watching and I pressed the side back down. Still, this is why I gave the product a 4/5.2. It took a month to get here from Israel but was worth the wait. When I contacted the seller he helped me track the package. Great customer service.3. Bath time is so much easier for me and happier for my 8 month old daughter. We started using it at 7 months. She could sit up on her own but not for long periods of time. Occasionally she would toss herself backwards and I was worried about her hurting herself in the tub. The seat was a perfect solution.",4,1
Boutique Infant Baby Clothes First BIRTHDAY Dress Girls 24M,"I purchased this dress for my daughter's (1ST) birthday party. I wanted something that had a birthday theme plus a number 1 on the dress, to show that she is turning 1. Everyone complimented the dress as they were arriving, they just loved it and how she looked so adorable.The great thing about this dress is, the number 1 actually can snap off and you can replace it with a number 2 or other different designs (which is provided with the dress). Therefore my daughter can wear it whenever and where ever!! Washes fantastic if you have the washer that has the ""hand wash"" cycle. Air dries perfect!!It is definitely worth the money!! Ships in no time.....but make sure to order a week before or so.",5,1
Baby Einstein Octoplush,I bought this for my 3 month old daughter and she enjoys the music and once she gets a little older I am hoping she will learn the colors. The music from the head is the perfect volume and it's great for her to look at during tummy time.,5,1

"Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog","My cousin gave us this little ducky for our shower and I have recently been giving it to my 4 month old son.  He won't take a pacifier, but he loves to suck and chew on this thing!  It has little sewn nubs on the corners, and they fit perfectly in hi mouth.  It's nice because if you are trying to introduce a ""security"" toy these are great--cheap, replaceable and can be given to a small infant to keep in their crib (no danger of suffocation like a blanket).  I would highly recommend it for someone who is looking for a cute toy a baby can carry around with them (or suck on!).  :)",4,1

"Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog","Wonderful lovey.  Soft and perfect for snuggling.  My son loves to suck on the trunk.  As soon as we give him Lovey, he gets into ""bedtime"" mode and calms down and starts snuggling.  I bought 3 to rotate after every 2-3 days (it gets grimey after a couple days of ""loving"") and it's the perfect amount for 2 in the wash and 1 in use.  They still look new after over a year.  Highly recommend.",5,1
"Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog","My wife and I wanted to introduce a transition toy to our daughter for naps bed time, car rides, etc. She absolutely loves it!

"Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog","My daughter grew attached to this blanket several months ago.  I had purchased an extra duck, after we left one at a friend's house in another state.  Since my replacement was $20 I only bought 2.  Then we lost another one out running errands.  I couldn't bring myself to go back to the baby boutique in our neighborhood and spend $20/blanket.  I'm so happy I found this company, I paid half the price and now we have 4 ducks.  That means I don't have to do laundry every other day.  Phew!  The blankets are perfect and I will certainly order more if our backup stash gets low again!",5,1
"Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog","Perfect for our little boy (now 11 months), he loves going to sleep with it and cuddling with it. Purchased two just in case we lost one, now considering ordering more. Soft, washes up well, not to big or small, we love this lovie.",5,1
SafeFit Kick Mats 2-Pack in Grey,I received this product and installed it into my 2011 Camry.  The lower elastic strip just fit over the sides of the seat making the fit snug on the bottom.  The straps on the top that go around the headrest were very long causing the cover to hang low and sag.  I wrapped the straps around the headrest support bars a few times and they worked perfectly.,5,1
Kiddopotamus Elite Duomat 2 in 1 Car Seat Protector Mat,"This is a very good (and necesary) purchase. Your car's seat (leather or fabric) will not suffer anymore. It's very easy to install, fit perfect in the car seat. I had to wash it and seems like new again.",5,1
OsoCozy - Indian Cotton - Prefold Cloth Diapers Infant 4x8x4,Ive been using these diapers exclusively for 18mo paired w thirsties covers. Perfect combo! Now that my daughter is 18mo I do have to make sure I change diapers after each potty or it may leak. She is close to potty training so I dont want to upgrade to the thicker line.,5,1
OsoCozy - Indian Cotton - Unbleached Prefold Cloth Diapers (Infant 4x8x4),"These were perfect for our new baby. A little bulky for a newborn, but I'm glad I bought these instead of newborn size which would have been outgrown very quickly. Perfect for stuffing nearly any diaper cover, very absorbent, and also great for spit rags, napkins, cleaning rags, etc.",5,1
Maxi-Cosi Priori Convertible Car Seat - Penguin,My daughter is very small for her age. She is 13 months and only 15 pounds 10 oz.. She was nearly too tall for her infant seat...graco snugride...so we needed one that could be rear-facing for her but last a decent amount of time.I rarely write reviews but always read them before I purchase anything big like this. We went with this one because of a review I read on Target regarding the size. I was very concerned about how much space this (or any convertable seat) would take up rear-facing. We have a Chevy uplander mini van but my parents have an impala and it needed to fit in there as well. It fits perfectly in both cars with plenty of room to spare for the driver and passenger in the front seats.We are also thrilled that our daughter doesn't cry anymore when we are in the car. She falls asleep most of the time now and if she isn't sleeping she is happy. She used to cry often in her infant seat.As for the problem I read regarding the straps. We've had no problems. I know that they recommend that you don't put heavy coats on your kids when they are in their car seats but we live in Central NY and warm jackets aren't an option....with temperatures below zero just a blanket won't due going from the car to the store.  We are able to adjust the straps without a problem to ensure that she is snug in there with or without her coat.The set-up was easy too. I admit that my husband did it the first time but just the other day I needed to move it to my parents car and he was able to explain over the phone what to do. It was simple.I love this seat. I only wish we had gotten it sooner for her. We are planning to get another one if we are fortunate enough to have another child. My guess is that our daughter will be in this for some time. I plan to keep her rear-facing as long as possible and since we are trying now to get pregnant again it looks like we will need another one. we are even debating just using this from the very beginning instead of an infant seat.I would highly recommend this to anyone!!!!,5,1
"Maxi-Cosi Priori Convertible Car Seat, Gipsy","I bought this car seat after purchasing an alpha omega elite, which turned out to be too big to fit my CR-V in the backward facing position. So I sold it and got my self this seat. It is perfect!!! VERY confortable for my daughther, who was 6 months when I got it, even when she falls asleep. Very easy to install and will keep tightly attached even in the bumpiest dirt roads. PLUS... very nice designs!! Wouldn't doubt to make this purchase again!!",5,1
Eddie Bauer Wall Border Teddy Bear,This border went perfectly with my Coca Lo ""Creme Brulee"" themed bedding/lamps/pictures I bought for my son's nursery. His nursery is so soothing and cute.,5,1
NoJo Jungle Babies Nursery Basket with Fabric Liner,"We ordered two of these baskets for the nursery, they were perfect size, great quality... and so we bought 4 more! Ha... yes def. worth it. the cover is so cute, the dark basket is just amazing and will work in any room really.  Just accents our nursery so well.",5,1
,"This superyard 3 in 1 metal gate is very good, very funcional, perfect size and practical, easy to put on and take off and the price was very good as well, it has work quite well to keep our puppy in the ktchen area while he learn the rules as a puppy, we love it",5,1
,This is perfect for keeping a toddler from getting near our gas stove. It is easy to use and does the job.,5,1
,"I've been looking for a chew-and-topple-resistant pen for an exuberant, large puppy.  I could just picture him flipping over the thin metal ones I saw in the pet stores, or chomping on the plastic ones. This is perfect. It's solid. I suppose some might find it heavy to travel with, but I use it in the house, so I appreciate that it doesn't move when puppy puts his big paws up and leans on it. It was easy to set up and it's easy to open the door.  There's nothing I don't like about it, so I give it five stars for being far better quality than the ones I've seen and owned so far.",5,1
,"Great item; sturdy; perfect for keeping our twin boys safe when running to do laundry, etc.  They actually like to play in there (even when I am in the room sometimes).  It's on the heavy side, but that is what we wanted; don't need the boys pushing it around! :)  I also love the vertical  bars (helps to limit climbing).",5,1
,"This thing works perfectly, shipped quite quickly, looks good (we use it as a 'time-out' area for our puppy training) is lightweight enough to move, but heavy enough to stay in place with dog craziness inside.  All in all great buy! (also easy to assemble / change layout if you read the directions).",5,1
,"It's easily assembled, easy to extend (once you figure out to pull down to remove the bars), and is the perfect play place / containment for my Great Dane and two Shih Tzus.  You really do need more than one or extensions though because just one is a very small area.  Maybe good for one Shih Tzu and his bed.",5,1
,Since my daughter lied to climb on the fire place and play on it we thought this would be perfect to get to keep her away from it and indeed it was great,5,1
North States Superyard 3 in 1 Wood Gate,"We purchased this gate to enclose our oversized stone fireplace. We were in search of something that was large enough to keep our toddler from getting to close to the fireplace but one that didn't stand out as an eyesore. Most gates we came across weren't large enough to cover our larger than normal fireplace, so we were estatic to come across this gate with the option of buying as many extenders as we needed. The measurements given on the website were accurate and with just one extender, it fit around our fireplace perfectly. It was also a bonus for us that we were able to get a nice neutral wood color, which blends with our fireplace quite nicely. We have had this gate up for several months now and it has worked out extremely well!",5,1
Bargoose Natural Cotton Fitted Bassinet Sheets,I needed extra sheets for our Summer Infant Rest Assured Sleeper and this one fit perfectly. It's also softer than the sheet that's included with the sleeper.,5,1
"Recaro Vivo High Back Booster Car Seat, Midnight Desert Micofiber","After having several boosters, this one is the best by far.  Most of the others on the market seem so flimsy, but this seat is super-sturdy.  It's nice and heavy (in a good way!) and does not tip in the car.  The belt fit is perfect on my son who is 6 1/2 years old, 50 lbs. and 50"" tall.  I see that many people on here have mentioned that the seat will be too narrow as their children grow.  Keep in mind, that as they grow and their torsos get longer, their shoulders will rise above the side wings and you will raise the headrest.  I noticed that many who have complained about that have smaller/shorter children. While it appears that it could be a problem, once you start to raise the headrest, you will see that space appears in between the head wings and side wings.  Remember that the shoulder belt guide should always be above your child's shoulders, not at or below them.  I would highly recommend this seat over any others I have seen and/or tried.",5,1
"Bumkins Waterproof Starterbib, Blue Fizz","I ordered this bib and one just like it in a different pattern for my son who was starting on solid foods. I've used a variety of bibs for my other kids, but I think this is the best one I've found for a baby who is just starting to eat food. It's durable and easy to clean, the Velcro hasn't worn out yet and it's small enough that it doesn't swallow him up like the bigger feeding bibs that are out there. Obviously when her gets bigger I will have to get him bigger ones, but for now it's just perfect. I keep one with his high chair and another in my diaper bag since it's small, flexible and easy to fold up to take along. I wish I'd had a couple of these with my older three kids!",5,1
"Bumkins Waterproof Starterbib, Blue Fizz","This fits our 10 month old perfectly.  I love that we just rinse it off to clean it after meals, then hang it back up to dry.  The pocket is also really great for catching food.  Our son likes to check the pocket at the end of his meals for crumbs!",5,1
Graco Contempo Highchair in Kasbah,We purchased this chair for our 4 month old.  I have tested and looked at many highchairs and this one was best for us.  I love the recline feature as my baby can have her bottle reclined.  I like the compact design as it folds very slim.  It is constructed very well and does not wobble.  The seat can be lowered to any height so you can pull it up to the table and have your child eat with the rest of the family.  The vinyl cover pattern is dark so it hides any stains and blends perfectly with our kitchen decor.It comes with a built in smaller tray underneath the larger removable tray and both are great and easy to use.  I like that there is a divider attached to the smaller tray so that my baby will never slide out of the chair.  The restraint system is very easy to use and can be undone with one hand.  You have a choice whether to use the shoulder straps or not.  I have purchased a couple of graco removable toys at Babies R Us that I insert into the two holes on the small or large tray.  This keeps my baby occupied during her feedings.The only possible drawback (not an issue for us) is if you have a very large/chubby baby.  It might be a tight fit so check it out at the store first.  Other than that it's the perfect chair and looks very stylish.  I would definitely buy this one again.,5,1
Empire Silver Sterling Beaded Dumbbell Rattle,Perfect in baby's hand and light.  Wonderful sound.  Design was lovely and teething is made easier. Works well in either hand,5,1
"Graco Ipo Stroller, Spitfire","I bought this stroller to replace my travel system stroller, which was too big and bulky. This is the perfect size stroller for my needs. I love that it fits in the back of my Tahoe behind the third row (which is a small area). I did buy a cup holder that straps to each hand rail. Overall, I have enjoyed this stroller and would recommend it to anyone in the market for a new ""umbrella like"" stroller.",5,1
"Graco Ipo Stroller, Spitfire","I did weeks of research before buying this stroller. I looked and test drove strollers from $ to very $$$. I mostly decided on this one because of the price compared to other models that looked just like it. I LOVE it!!! Easy to put together. It is also super easy to unfold/fold and push. It turns on a dime! Has locking back wheels and locking swivel wheels in the front. A feature I wouldn't have even though was important till you stop on an incline to watch animals at the zoo. I have used this already at 2 zoos, metro, and many trips shopping. It reclines fully so my 2 year old can sleep comfortably. The leg rest adjust for extra comfort. Has a good sized basket. If you are looking to carry everything and the kitchen sink...then you need to keep using your full size travel system stroller. This holds a sweater, my purse, smaller bags and, food/drinks. The handle height is perfect. I'm 5'3 but my husband is 6'3 and says it is perfect for him and he doesn't kick the wheels. Has great locking system so it doesn't unfold when packing up. Does not tip over with bags/purses/diaper bag on the handles. And the 5 point harness breaks apart so you can use it completely or just the lap belt. My 2 year old has plenty of room to grow. It holds 50 lbs, but she will definitely be out walking before she ever outgrows it. I put my 4 year old 40 lbs. niece in it and it drove and felt the same pushing as with my much smaller daughter. Folds up small and is machine WASHABLE!!! Great color for boy or girl. CONS: The canopy can pop off if you pull it too hard and fast to open..so don't do that (but snaps right back on easily). You have to make sure that the basket is totally out of the way or it will not lock to open. Make sure the lock is clear before struggling like I did the 1st time to figure out why it wouldn't lock. Doesn't free stand by itself. So can be a bit difficult to get in trunk if you are trying to handle 2 or 3 things at the same time. You can lock the wheels before folding and prop it against something to help.  My 2 friends paid over $50 more for their umbrella strollers and they look exactly the same, but don't drive as smooth or turn as well. The more expensive strollers are not worth it when this one is available. Has everything they have but for much less $$$. If you are looking to impress with a name brand, buy something else.  If you are looking for a great, durable, practical stroller that you are going to only use 2-3 years, buy this one.",5,1
The First Years 2 Pack Breastflow Stage 1 Slow Flow Nipple,"I recommend these nipples to other breastfeeding mothers. One of my children didn't take to breastfeeding right away and had difficulty latching on. She learned to &#34;latch&#34; to the bottle and after a month of use (and pumping), she was able to latch to my breast perfectly. The other children learned to latch earlier but switching from breastflow nipples to actual breast never posed a problem with any of them (3 children in total). I continue to use it for my youngest toddler.",5,1
One Dozen (12) Rubber Duckie Ducky Duck Christmas Nativity Scene,"I got this for my niece who is 4 and just starting to really understand the real reason besides Christmas, rather than just Santa and presents. She adores this set!This is perfect for kids to play with so they don't try to play with the more fragile sets you have. They have been well loved and still look brand new.",5,1
"Bestever Baby Mat, Pink Bear","I just bought this for my friend's new baby girl after seeing it for $50 at a baby boutique (not including tax). I found it here on Amazon for much cheaper and my friend's baby and mommy love it! Its sooooo soft and very very cute. The lamb one is so cute too. It's perfect for babies to lay on instead of the floor. She is thrilled with it, its a very unique item to gift as a baby shower so I'd definitely recommend it. And get it on Amazon, its way cheaper than in the stores!",5,1
"Bestever Baby Mat, Pink Bear","This was a Christmas gift from my aunt for our eight and a half month old daughter.  It wasn't something I ever thought of buying or thought I needed, but now that I have it I can't live without it!  Although our daughter is sitting up, she still flops back or to the side at times; I was propping pillows next to her on the floor during playtime, but it is a pain to always drag the pillows to the play area and you can't just throw them in the washing machine when you are done.This mat is the perfect answer!  We love it! It is SUPER soft and the size is perfect.  You can throw it in the washing machine (cold water, gentle cycle) which is ideal for spit up/drooling babies.  The kitty one is so cute and perfect for our daughter since we have a cat that she adores.  I saw the others and they look really sweet as well.The only negative: it seems to shed slightly (our daughter does love to pull on the fur though).I will consider giving this for baby showers in the future!  I uploaded a picture :)",5,1
"Bestever Baby Mat, Pink Bear","My daughter has a vintage baseball themed baby's room, and this baby mat is just perfect for it.  It is so very soft,and just so cute! It has a hanging loop at the top, so if she wanted to use it as a wall hanging, she could do so. I am 100% pleased with this product!",5,1
"Solarsafe Stroller , Playard &amp; Pack 'n Play Net - 85% UV protection","We have a Graco travel stroller, and this fits wonderfully. It works PERFECTLY, even better than I had expected at protecting my baby from the heat and sun! She even felt quite cool under there, while I scorched in the sun. It even conveniently folds itself into a pouch. A must-buy!",5,1
Chicco KeyFit &amp; KeyFit30 Infant Car Seat Base - Anthracite,"This was a Gift for a friend, they said it worked perfectly, and fit easily into their BMW 3 series",5,1
BabyKing Nail Clipper,"PERFECT SIZE FOR CARRYING IN MY VARIOUS PURSES FOR THOSE UNSEEN NAIL ACCIDENTS!Yes, no babies in sight!  I searched for these because they are small and convenient for those nail accidents and need a quick fix with little weight and little space!",5,1
"Baby K'tan Breeze Baby Carrier, White, Large","easy to use and carry along.perfect for newborn.wished I had it for my first 2 kids.However,it is probably not so comfortable for extended period of carrying when kid is bigger or heavier.",5,1
"Baby K'tan Breeze Baby Carrier, White, Large","Very quick and easy to use. Got it when my baby was 6 weeks old,  wish I had it when he was born.  I like the breathable mesh side,  the material is like what basketball shorts are made of.  Would highly recommend this product. In 5'5&#34; and 160lbs, medium fits perfect.  I was worried about choosing the right size so I called company and they helped me figure out the right size.",5,1
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Mini Bassinet, Natural","This was my absolute favorite baby item that I purchased.  I LOVED being able to have my baby close to me while not having to worry that I would roll over on her.  It was so wonderful to be able to reach over and pat her back or give her pacifier to her.  It also was very helpful since I'm a nursing mom.  She woke four or five times a night to nurse and I could easily pull her into bed with me to nurse, then place her back in the cosleeper.  My only complaint is it really is not that portable.  It's very heavy and quite cumbersome to take down and put up.  I didn't really buy it to use as a travel item, but more just to use at home.  For that, it was perfect.",4,1
"Kushies Flushable Biodegradable Diaper Liners, 100 Sheets","We've tried a few diaper liners and we like these ones best.  They are softer than others and fit perfectly in our cloth daipers.  For us they are a great price too because we are Prime members and get free shipping.  If you use cloth diapers, these are great, they make cleaning easy because they are flushable.",5,1
Neat Solutions 10 Count Sesame Street Multi-Use Pads,"Nice little sized item that saved my lap and clothes and change table from my babies feces!  I keep a pack by my feeding station so I can grab and place in my lap when baby shows signs of defecating.  Also good to travel with, especially when a lap change is all you can do.  As the picture shows, it can hold an average sized baby IF he/she is curled up.  Perfect size to use under baby's butt (neck to knee), which is fine for me.I deducted one star because it tore easier than I expected (by my pulling, not by baby's heavy load). Lol!",4,1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This has been a lifesaver for my Grandson!  It is perfect and the vibration takes those hurting gums off of his mind.,5,1
Munchkin Caterpillar Spillers Stacking Cups,"i looked at a few different nesting cup toys and eventually purchased this one because it lends itself to so many different kinds of play. a few months ago, when my child first started playing with this, we would stack or nest the cups for her. she would knock the stack down and pull the cups out from one another when they were nested. in the bath, she would be fascinated by the water running through them. in the park, the same thing only with sand. just before she turned 1 yr old, she started sorting with them -- putting other small objects into each of the cups. this is one of the few toys that has held her interest for months. she's a bit young still, but i also talk about the color spectrum when she plays with it. it seems like every set is a different mix of colors, but the one we wound up with loosely follows the order of colors in the spectrum of light when it's organized by size. it's lovely that it is inexpensive and doesn't take up much space at all when nested. it's a great gift for infants and the perfect toy to bring along when you travel.",5,1
Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer,"I like this product very well. I do both breastfeed and pump at work. Obviously I have to clean lot of bottles everyday. I hand wash them and sterilize them using this sterilizer. After sterilizing they look spotless and sooo fresh. Even though they say 4 bottles, I manage to put 3 feeding bottles, 3 storage bottles (as they take less space)and 2 pumping breast shields and lids, nipples, caps. They fit perfectly and be sterilized well. I bought First Years bottle drying stand to dry them. Bottle washing is a boring job but I enjoy using these 2 things clean bottles everyday without frustration.",5,1
Combi Helio DX Lightweight Stroller in Ember/Wasabi,"We love the Combi Helio.  It's lightweight and compact.  Perfect for traveling.  Our only complaint is in the lack of parent cup holders.  Sometimes, a drink will fit into the drink holder on the bag.  Oftentimes, we find that the bag is too flimsy and drinks end up spilling.  Overall, a great product!",4,1
"Colgate Classica III Foam Crib Mattress, White","This is an excellent quality mattress and after 2 years it is still in perfect condition.  I have owned less expensive mattresses and after time, they either lost their shape or become too soft and almost flimsy.  I love that there is a very firm (but still comfortable) side for infants and you can later flip it to the toddler side.  We will be purchasing a second Colgate Classica III Foam Mattress in a few weeks for our new baby. I would absolutely recommend this mattress!",5,1
Bonaco Caboose Travel Potty - The Diaper Potty,"Purchased to take on our Disney Land Vacation as an &#34;emergency potty stop.&#34; for my 2 1/2  year old and her older brother. I have a Cool Gear Travel Potty that we keep in the car which I use this one with potette plus liners.  It's too big though to take with us in our packing or carry on so I took a look for alternatives.  This is indeed small and compact, which is awesome.  We tried it with a diaper but as other reviewers have said it can be hard to get it to stay in place so you end up with liquid in the base.  I then tried it with a Potette Plus Liner and volia, perfect! It sits inside and the edges turn out over the sides of the potty effectively covering most of the potty.  NO leaks to be cleaned up.  Carefully lift the liner away after use, tie it in a knot and throw away. Very happy with my potty!",5,1
Camden Rose Cherry Rattle,This is perfect for my babies small hands. It is well made and I feel good about giving my baby a safe toy to chew on.,5,1
Orbit Baby Infant Weather Pack **CLOSEOUT**,"I received this product about a week ago, and it does the job.  The fit is perfect for the infant car seat.  For the bassinet, however, the fit is a little tight and awkward.  There are zippers on the sides of both the mosquito net and rain shield, so you can wrap them around the carrier strap.  Note: those zippers can be tedious and a pain to work with when in a hurry (but what isn't inconvenient when the clock is ticking??) Overall, the rain shield does the job, along with the insect net.  I like that I can access my little one without having to pull up the entire rain shield because of the zippered window in the front.  There is, also, a little mesh window on each side of the handles, so there's ventilation, too.  Just remember to take your time when it comes to using the rain shield with the bassinet (it doesn't fit as well when compared to the infant car seat).  I do recommend this product, though!",4,1
"Kidorable Fireman Toddler Hanger Set, Medium 5","BOught these for Xmas for my son. He has a fire engine themed room and these are the perfect touch for it. They were a little pricey, but they are painted nicely and they actually encourage him to hang up his own clothes.",5,1
"Graco Victoria Non Drop Side 5 In 1 Convertible Crib, White",We bought this crib for our son and his wife for their baby girl.It is exactly what they had requested and works perfectly.,5,1
Little Tikes Discover Sounds Universal Remote,"My son loved this remote control. As many babies he used to play with the Bluray or TV remote control, so I bought this one for him.The material made of is perfect for a baby. Easy to clean. Many sounds! After 3 years I have bought, it still works perfect.",5,1
Boppy Total Body Pillow,I am in my twentieth week of pregnancy and just got this pillow last weekend for my birthday. I cannot find words to describe just how much I love it! It has perfect support & comfort for my head and will finally allow me to sleep on my side comfortably. I was sleeping on my side but ending up more on my stomach than I thought I should and this helps tremendously. It is so soft and comfortable and truly makes me look forward to going to bed each night!,5,1
Disney Pooh Musical Mobile Delightful Day,i loved this product its awesoe... the butterflys dont open like the picture shows but im working on them its still amazing! and matches the crib bedding perfect!,5,1
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Early Walker Wearable Blanket, Baby Blue, Large","My 15-month-old son is 31 inches tall and weighs 25 pounds, and the large size fits him beautifully. If I try to cover him with a blanket while he's sleeping, he always manages to kick it off right away, so this Sleep Sack is the perfect solution for the coming winter months. We were big fans of the traditional Sleep Sacks (without the foot holes) last winter when he was just a few months old, so I was excited to discover that there exists a version like this for walkers! Bonus - it's so soft and snuggly!",5,1
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Early Walker Wearable Blanket, Baby Blue, Large","It works really well!  Runs a little on the large side. Not something I like our 18 month old daughter in while playing before bed / after waking up since it's a little bulky, but it works perfect for sleeping which is what it was designed for. I would buy this again, it's great.",5,1
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Early Walker Wearable Blanket, Baby Blue, Large","Thanks to all of the reviewers who commented on the sizes running large. I ordered the XL and it fits my 2-year-old daughter perfectly and keeps her cozy all night! She calls it her &#34;bankie&#34; and carries it around like Linus from Peanuts. The quality is good but not excellent - the ribbed material at the leg openings pilled up after a few washes but all she does is sleep in it, so no big deal. I would definitely recommend it for those with chilly winter nights.",4,1
Children Giraffe Individual Feeding Spoon,"This spoon is the perfect angle for first time feedings! Plus, it is very cute. Every baby needs a silver spoon at some point!",5,1
McKenzie Kids Messenger Bag Brown/Aqua,"We love this bag for quick trips- like to the grocery store, errand running, day trips, etc. Its small enough to not weigh you down but large enough for 4-6 nb diapers, wipes, change of clothes, burp clothes, cover up. Nice zippered compartments. Like the front compartment for my wallet, keys, and cell phones. I have a droid so that doesn't fit in the cell phone pocket on the strap...meant for a smaller cell. It is slightly tough to get in and out of the bag as it doesn't open up extremely wide but for a quick diaper change, it works great. Slings over your shoulder and doesn't get in the way. Great material. Our 3 week old has already christened it and it wipes clean perfectly. Definitely recommend this bag!",5,1
Boon Catch Bowl - Toddler Bowl with Spill Catcher in Orange/Blue,"Pros:  food catcher, perfect size for toddler portions, dishwasher safe, BPA freeCons: the food catcher can be used as a handle to throw the bowlReview:The concept is brilliant. When a toddler is still mastering the use of a fork and spoon food often spills on the way from the bowl to her mouth.  The idea of something `catching' that is wonderful.This bowl may look a little funny but it does exactly what it sets out to do- it catches food that doesn't make it into your child's mouth en route from the bowl to her mouth.When I first used this with my daughter she saw the `catcher' portion as a handle in which to throw the bowl.  I had to swap out the bowl the first two times. The catcher was a distraction as well since it juts out toward the child.  However, after using it a few times she got used to it being there and we now use it a few times a week with no trouble at all.  It has caught globs of oatmeal and is my favorite bowl to use when feeding my daughter cold cereal.I wash this bowl in the dishwasher after each use and have had no problems with it warping or not suctioning.Overall, I think it is a good addition to your child's tableware.[...]",4,1
Graco Humidifier Replacement Filter for 4.0 Gallon,This is a perfect replacement for the filter in our Graco humidfier.  It does the job as it should and we will buy another when the time comes.,5,1
"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb","Soft, very small. Perfect little gift for a baby dedication. It is has a soft rattle. The baby really enjoyed it and the parents loved it.",5,1
"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb","I was searching for a special christening gift for our godchild...something out of the ordinary which she could enjoy.  This little plush rattle is adorable!  The embroidered cross on its heart is a great reminder of our godchild's new life in Christ, and of course the lamb is a symbol of innocence, purity, the ""Lamb of God"" in whom she is baptized!  It's a little smaller than I expected, but then again, it's a perfect size for a little one to grasp.  Nice, inexpensive, token-type gift...I'm also very pleased with my purchase experience from Amazon.",4,1
"Snazzy Baby My Baby's Own Deluxe Travel Chair, Navy","I love this harness.  We have an old fashioned wooden high chair and needed a safety harness so baby wouldn't slip.  I looked everywhere online and this is the best harness I found.  It is perfect and stays put and keeps my baby safe.  The shoulder straps aren't perfect and can move around, but the waist belt gets the job done.  Baby fits snuggly and safely in and isn't going anywhere.  I imagine this is good for traveling to restaurants, etc as well.  Maybe in a store grocery cart as well.",4,1

CTM&reg; Infants Elastic Clip-End 1 Inch Solid Suspenders,My 3 month old son was being a garden gnome for Halloween and these worked out perfectly! We ordered these a few days before Halloween and got them right on time!,5,1
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"I bought this for my son at five months old and he loved it. Now, at sixteen months old he still enjoys it! Fits perfectly in door tram and if you look at the instruction booklet, it shows you how to raise it higher.",5,1
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"After trying two other jumpers -- one that was WAY too wobbly and one that was really noisy -- we ordered this one. It's been perfect.The strap is fairly long so we had to tie a knot in it, because our son is fairly tall and pretty heavy, but it's worked like a charm since. He's happy. We're happy. Good buy.",5,1
Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Moka,"I LOVE IT -- the perfect combination of lightweight + recliningit is light -- easy to fold and open -- the one hand open and close option works very well (after you 'figure it out').  very durable -- we have taken it on 5-6 trips -- it has been (man)-handled by the baggage handlers at many different airports (in the US and in a few South American countries)the reclining is more than enough to get my baby to sleep comfortably --- the hood is a little small (especially when the seat is reclined), so we used a jacket or blanked to provide additional shade while she was sleeping.it is easy to maneuver in small spaces and on all sorts of surfacesfits easily in a regular sedan trunk",5,1
"The Deglingos Baby Blankie, Lapinos The Bunny","Very adorable, unique, and softer than you could imagine.  Perfect baby gift!  Only Issue: The term ""blankie"" is deceiving, as it is small, and looks more like a deflated stuffed animal, not ""blankie"" size.  Highly recommend this purchase.",4,1
Blabla Bubbles Doll,This definitely is a cat that is sure to bring a smile to your child's face.  BlaBla is so perfectly made and of quality products.  I was so pleased with this product I am looking to buy more!!!,5,1
"Summer Infant  8 Panel Playsafe Playard, Tan","I read some reviews prior to ordering this and they were both positive & negative. I have found it worked perfect for our use of an apartment enclosed patio off the spare bedroom. We have two small dogs that like to be outside, we zip tied the panels to the privacy fence and it gives them a place to play. Before we had a 21 inch space where they could get out now they are safe. Great product for my use!",5,1
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),I was looking for bottles that fit Similac disposable nipples as I give my baby both Similac powder and Ready to feed formula. These Medela bottles work perfectly! The nipple covers that come with this set do not fit will over the Similac nipples but it doesn't bother me. I just remove the nipple and use the included bottle caps when I am on the go. I am very happy with this purchase!,5,1
Tadpoles Three Bulb Chandelier in Black Onyx,"I like this chandelier a lot. It's the perfect size, it's not big or gaudy. It put in my bedroom and it adds just the right chic touch to the space.",5,1
Fisher-Price Lil' Laugh and Learn Bouncer,I received this bouncer as a shower gift after I already bought the graco bouncer that matched my car seat. I almost retured it but i'm so glad i didn't. My son hates the graco one that folds up and is portable. I think it sits up to high. This bouncer is perfect as a newborn he loved the vibrations and the angle was perfect for him to be comfortable. Now that he's 8 weeks he loves the music and he especially loves watching the sun and bumble bee light up. He gets so happy every time i put him in it. And the songs are really cute plus it has 2 volume setting so you can turn it down when you start to get sick of the noise.,5,1
Natural Mat Latex Mat,We bought this in 2009 for our daughter and have recently bought it again for our next arrival. They are perfect and hold up well. We even upgraded our oldest to the twin size. It's firm and organic...doesn't smell in the least bit. Perfect for a clean nursery,5,1

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Rainforest",This is the perfect booster for Granny's house.....can be stored.....grandson luvs the tray with all the activity....highly recommend....easy to travel with also.,4,1
Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Jumperoo,This was perfect for my little boy.  I like all the different activities and my baby loved that it could bounce and would really get going on it and it withstood it great.  I like that it adjusted as he grew and was a great way for me to get things done around the house and he loved it.,5,1
Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Jumperoo,"Totally love the product, its very educational and my daughter loves it. I will totally recommend!!! My daughter is is 3 days away from turning 6 months and she touches the floor with her tippi toes, but I got those alphabetical foam floor mats and stacked them underneath her feet so she could stand better and it worked perfectly.",5,1
Dappi Brand Nylon Diaper Pants-2 pack (Size Small 14-19 lbs) [Baby Product],"I use these everyday, and they are my favorite diaper cover. They are easy to use, clean perfectly, and I have not had a single leak. The only problem is when I change wet or dirty diapers I have to put something under the baby because the wet diaper ends up soaking whatever it touches with the cover removed.",5,1
"Boppy Blissfully Soft Slipcover, Pink on Pink",Shipped fast and perfect packaging. Soft and perfect for snuggling with the new little one! Will definitely get lots of use out it!,5,1
"Boppy Blissfully Soft Slipcover, Pink on Pink",This cover was perfect for my bby!! She loves it so much as do I!! Super soft and feels great against your skin! Recommend 100% to everyone!!,5,1
Bambino Mio Swim Nappy-Pink Spot-Small,"This nappy was perfect. My baby girl just started swim classes and she was required to have a disposable swim diaper and a swim nappy. I thought this was a little pricey, but we will be able to use it for quite a while since there are drawstings so we can adjust the size.",5,1
Bambino Mio Bio Liners - 160 Sheet Pack,"The liners work wonderful.  They make cloth diapering easy.  Liquids pass, solids are captured.  They would be perfect if they were about an inch longer.",4,1
Tupperware Bell Tumbler Sippy Cups with Seals Set of 4,"Tupperware has been around for a long time, and these came recommended to me by my son's pediatrician beacuse they don't have valves added.  The lids are a little difficult to get on and off initially, but it does become easier with use. My son is still not all that interested in them right now because he loves to chew on things, but they are the perfect size for his little hands!",5,1
"JL Childress Wheelie Car Seat Travel Bag, Black","We bought these to travel with our two Britax car seats (Frontier and Parkway), they both fit perfectly.  They are a little difficult to pull, but not bad.  It was a lot easier than than trying to carry them, and it kept them clean.  It was easy to get the seats in and out of the bag, we were able to do it quickly in the rental car drop off lane with no problem.  So glad we got these, very helpful!",5,1
"BabySmart Cooshee Booster Seat Classicwith Travel Bag, Onyx","We love this seat!  I was nervous about putting my 2.5 year old in a seat that didn't attach to the chair (since our dining room chairs have no arms).  But after a few weeks, it didn't slide around anymore.  So, we've had no problems.  No problems, that is, until the other night when we went to move it from the DR chair to the living room because he wanted to sit in it to watch TV.  When I peeled it off the DR chair, it took some of the finish with it!  Not good. Had it not been for that small(ish) problem, I would have given this seat a perfect rating!",4,1
"BABYBJORN Travel Crib Light , Blue","This crib is light but sturdy so you'll actually want to take it when you travel.  Because it's so easy to carry and assemble, we sometimes take it when we visit friends houses so my son will have somewhere to sleep.  He loves it and sleeps very well in it.  It's really easy to fold and unfold (a little more difficult to put back in its case, but nothing too hard).  It's expensive but totally worth it.  Just don't buy the sheets made by Baby Bjorn.  They're way too expensive and American Baby Company (ABC) sheets (travel crib size 24""x38"") fit perfectly and cost a lot less.",5,1
Tadpoles Table Lamp Chandelier in White Diamond,"This is perfect for my nightstand in my shabby chic bedroom. I have a 60 watt candelbra bulb in it which gives a lot of light, I might even put a 40 Watt in since it is so bright. The base is clear, not white which is what I thought it would be. Unfortunately the clear base makes it look cheaper than I expected, I think I might paint it so you can't tell that it's plastic. But overall, this is a very pretty lamp.",5,1
UPPAbaby G-Lite and G-Luxe Stroller Travel Bag,"I purchased this bag for our upcoming trip to Europe. Last time we traveled, our stroller was sent to carousel a few times. It came all dirty and the recline  buckle wasn't working anymore so we decided this time we will protect our expensive Bumbleride Flite stroller. Bumbleride doesn't make their own umbrella stroller bags. I almost bought RoverGear Bag because it had very good reviews. It looked like it would fit most strollers and I wanted something that wouldn't be too big and bulky for our umbrella stroller. So i went ahead with this one even though I was not sure about the right sizing because the sizing that amazon has for this product doesn't make sense to me. I decided I will buy this if it's too small i will return it and buy something else. I usually don't do that but I am glad I gave this bag a shot. I have to tell though, this product is different from the picture. It's well made, one side is bigger to fit the front wheels, easy to put the stroller in and out,well padded in all sides. It might be a new G-series travel bag which is a little bigger and with two zippers. It's not snug as the other reviews mention, it's just the perfect size or maybe it's perfect for my Bumblerdie Flite only. It has two yellow carry straps, i wish it had a shoulder strap too but it's ok beacuse I can unzip it a little bit and use my stroller's shoulder strap. I will post sometime pictures and sizing for this product and also update my review after our trip.",5,1
"Joovy Zoom 360 Swivel Wheel Jogging Stroller, Blue","We bout this as our 2nd stroller for our first child, after using The First Years Waveuntil she outgrew it around 10 months.  Our criteria were simple: bang for the buck, easy to use, swivel front wheel.  The Joovy has all of these and a few free accessories to boot.  It's perfect for us and we would reco to anyone looking for the same.",5,1
"Joovy Zoom 360 Swivel Wheel Jogging Stroller, Blue","After owning Chicco strollers (which were very good too - just outgrew them) & Britax strollers, I researched for a taller/higher stroller as we are tall people.  It is really hard to find strollers & pretty much anything for taller parents & children.  I really wish I would have found this stroller sooner.  I could have avoided several of the other strollers we bought.  I also wanted the 360 degree turn & the smooth ride jogging strollers provide.I have nothing but GOOD things to say about this Joovy stroller including the price (2 minor cons described below).Here are some of the best points of the Joovy stroller:*It is a quiet & gentle ride*It is extremely smooth*The included canopy is very large providing more coverage*Sits high so when you go to put them in & out you don't throw your back out*Children actually seem happier to be in there as they sit up high & are comfortable*Multi-position seat position to recline*cup holders & basket underneath*don't kick your feet into the back while walking b/c more clearance*there is a step in the front for when they are able to climb in & out on their own*BEST FACT:  for taller parents the handle height is wonderful.  If your 5 foot 8 & taller from experience this is a great stroller for you.  I'm not saying it isn't good for those that aren't that tall - it's probably just as good for you, but as a tall parent I'm always looking for feedback on items that are good for tall people*included air pump*good price*the blue color is beautiful & very cool looking - get compliments all the timeThe are only 2 cons I can think of:1)  I wish the back seat went higher b/c if you have taller children you need that - it would be perfect w/ about 2 more inches; however, it is important to note that this IS ONE OF THE TALLER SEAT BACKS ON A STROLLER YOU WILL FIND so I shouldn't complain.  You can make it work, but for comfort reason I really want another couple inches.  It is hard to find a stroller w/ the same height as this one so don't let that deter you.2)  I agree w/ another reviewer that the way to recline the seat isn't the best. It isn't actually a lever/button, but kind of like a hat strap that goes under your chin to make it stay on your head - sorry can't think of a better comparison & you'll see when you do it. It's just kind of hard to do especially if your child is sitting in the stroller.While I do have these 2 con's, this would not keep me from still purchasing this stroller.  It is absolutely wonderful & @ around $199.00 you are getting an awesome stroller!Highly recommend especially if you are tall parents or have taller children.",5,1
"Kids Line Luxury Contour Changing Pad Cover, Sage","This changing pad cover is an awesome (difficult to find) color~ it fits my nursery decor perfectly, is soft and reasonably priced.",5,1
SoHo Forest Buddy Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"I loved the pattern before we received it but then really LOVED it when I got it. The quality is much better than I expected and it fit so perfectly in my son's room. It's been about a year since I've had it and all the pieces have been through (and held up through) a lot of washes, accidents, and cuddles since. There were so many extras too, such a great deal. Would definitely buy from the company again!",5,1
Summer Infant Day &amp; Night Flat Screen Color Video Monitor with 7&quot; LCD Screen,"I really wanted a video monitor, but was very hesitant to purchase due to the poor reviews on all the monitors I had looked at. I have to say that I am very happy with this purchase. I have owned this monitor for several weeks now and it works great. It was easy to set up and there really was no need to look at the directions. The video is great for daytime and night vision. Some reviews say that it's color is a little off during the day, and the truth is it is, but if you read the manual, it says that it needs to be really well lit to get the best color. Honestly, does it really matter if the color is a little off? Isn't the whole point to see your child? The sound however is extremely sensitive. While this would normally be a good thing, I wish that it was a little less so. I only ever turn the sound up by one notch. Unless you have an extremely loud house, there really isn't need for anything much higher than the very fist volume setting. Besides, if you do have that loud of a house, how do you expect your child to sleep anyway? As far as the interference goes, yes of course it has some at times. But you will find that true for any wireless device. No matter what monitor you get, you are bound to end up with some interference, especially if you have a cordless phone, wireless network, wireless controllers for any game console if they are operating on the same frequency. The power cords are much longer than expected and allows for you to place the devices almost anywhere. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who really needs some peace of mind while their child is sleeping in their crib, or whatever the use may be. I almost got a different monitor with a smaller screen, but after owning this monitor, I am most certainly happy that we went with the bigger screen. I can look at it from across the room and still see my child perfectly. The picture quality is so good, that I can actually see my child breathing.",5,1
"Edushape 4&quot; Sensory Balls, Set of 4, Solid","Baby loves it.  Perfect size and texture.  Baby learned to throw a ball first with these!  We also bought the larger ones we liked them so much.  Highly recommend for strong, very physical baby boys.",5,1
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","I almost didn't buy a new gate and figured i would save the money and struggle with the old plastic one I had. I could not be happier that I bought this. Its only three days old so i cant speak for how it ages. The latch works perfect and install took second. The only problem was it was very heavy to get out of the box. It you want it too lock behind you then you have to let it slam shut. The opening is kinda small as other people have noted but it's wide enough to walk thru while holding my dog. The color is a really nice brown with black hardware. My dog tends to jump all the other gates but this one is tall enough to keep her from even thinking about it. Also, the fact that it's metal keeps my puppy from chewing it like he did the plastic ones.",4,1
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","We have an opening between the living room and kitchen that is about 46"" wide and this was the most reasonably priced gate we could find that could accommodate this width.  We are using it to block the grand-dogs out of the kitchen when they come visit us, which is why we wanted a pressure mounted gate as opposed to hardware mount.  The gate was easy to set up and we especially like the walk-through door feature. For baby purposes the hands-free gate would probably be the better choice but for pet purposes, this gate does the job perfectly.",5,1
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze",Needed this gate for french doors. I was not able to directly attach a gate to the wall so this tension gate worked perfect.,5,1
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze",I orderd two of these from amazon to keep my dogs on the deck. They worked out perfectly. Excellent quality. I can leave them up all the time because of the walkthru feature. And they look really nice. Easy assembly. Worth every penny! Shipping was superfast with prime.,5,1
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","This is the perfect gate for my house. I am confident that my child is safer with this gate and am pleased that I am able to protect her and have a gate at the entry way of my home that doesn't detract from all of the home improvements and redecorating that my husband completed right before we were blessed with a child. However, I agree with previous posters that the passageway in the gate could stand to be a few inches wider. With the gate being so tall it is hard to pass through and lift over the railing bulky items like the car seat. Beyond that, I have been pleased with how sturdy the gate is and with the installation process.",4,1
Nurse Carrington Teddy Bear by Bearington Bear,During a recent illness my wife took care of me like a nurse. I wanted to give her something to show  my appreciation. The bear was perfect.  When I had to go to the hospital my wife packed it in my suitcase to watch over me. The quality and price were excellent.,5,1
Lillebaby Eurotote Cocoa Couture Baby Carrier Tote - Lillebaby L1102,"I was looking for a product that made life with a toddler and newborn easier. We chose not to use a carrier carseat for our newborn, thus opted for a convertible carseat. With that decision came the trouble of where to put our newborn while we were out to eat, at church, library time, etc... I had seen this product on other websites and decided to check it out. I am so happy I did!The EuroTote has totally made it easier to bring my newborn out and about. The bag is super warm so the cold European nights aren't as brutal when we're out. She sleeps so well in it. Sometimes we just keep her in the bag and swing it back and forth to get her to nap. It also fits perfectly in our buggy so if our toddler gets out to walk, the Tote goes in the buggy.I highly recommend it as a nice break from a carrier that's attached to you.",5,1
"Grimm's Set of 5 Small Wooden Stacking &amp; Nesting Rainbow Bowls, Blue Outside","We love this toy. Bright colors, sturdy, safe, well-made. The small set is perfect for my nine-month-old who loves to bang them together, dump them out, chew on them, etc. Very engaging, even at this age. And as she grows they will encourage imaginative play. It's nice to have some no-frills old-fashioned toys to balance out the fun noisy plastic stuff.",5,1
"Nuby 2 Handle Flip n' Sip Straw Cup, 8 Ounce, 12 Months +, Colors May Vary","I thought by the information provided, I would receive more than one cup!  But no...just one arrived!  Nice color and perfect when mom stops nursing.",4,1
Tiddliwinks Sailboat Mobile,This is a beautiful mobile. It went perfect with the other things i already had for the nursery. Good quality and good on shipping also.,5,1
"The First Years True Fit Convertible Car Seat, Monet","I was looking for a convertible carseat for our 30lb toddler that allows him to continue to facing backwards.  The cover is easy to remove for washing, I found it very easy to install in our car with the exception of re ""snapping"" the cover into place (it has to be removed to access the security pieces).  I ended up basically jamming the cover in between the car seat and the seat of my vehicle.There is plenty of room, adjustments to the shoulder straps are easy and can be done without any removal and nicely even with your toddler in the straps if you want.  I do find the strap to tighten or loosen the straps is easy to use, but not while facing backwards as it is kind of between the vehicle seat and car seat (just like the snaps).If you were using this seat for a very young infant it almost certainly would need a noodle or towel to be under the seat to get it level, but I didn't bother with this since my son is old enough that he has his windway open without issues.In a nut shell, this is a great seat, and I imagine that it will be hassle free entirely when our son faces forwards, but in the meantime it is nearly perfect with only a few silly hassles.We bought two of these, one for each car, and are happy with it.",4,1
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"I love this little player - everything is perfect except I should save it for later. My baby is almost 5mths old and her hand movements are still not very smooth yet. So sometimes she exerts too much force, and this player almost potentially hits her head or anywhere on her face. It makes my heart jump a lot each time she plays with it. I have to be watching her like a hawk. So as not to risk anything, I have stopped giving her this player. Going to save this little guy for later when my baby's hand movements are in better control.",5,1
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"It is the best toy ever!!! my beby loves it, I cannot take her out of home without her Baby Einstein take along tunes. The music is relaxing, she cal also bite the toy, easy to hold, perfect!",5,1
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"My son loves this, at the age of 1 he can change songs, carry it around, and shake his hips to the music. Very good sound, great selection of songs. Perfect gift for a new baby or 1 year old.",5,1
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"With its perfect little infant sized handle to its wonderful classical tunes, this baby &#8220;MP3&#8221; player is certain to have even the tiniest of tots engaged and happy. It has such an unbeatable price and a wonderful value. There&#8217;s even a volume control and it&#8217;s just so fun to watch babies make noise with it! I ordered a few of these for my daycare so that the kids wouldn&#8217;t have to fit and they have certainly been a crowd favorite. Any new or expecting parents should definitely have this toy on hand for a fussy baby! It&#8217;ll work wonders, I promise!",5,1
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"I got this for my daughter for her first birthday because of the high reviews.  I know she was a little young for it, but she loves music and is always wanting to play with her siblings mp3 players.  I know she would have liked this at a younger age, but she still loves it 8 months later!  She dances when she plays it, and likes to hold on to it.  It is smaller than I had expected, but it turns out it's the perfect toy for roadtrips.  It will hold her attention for quite awhile in the car, and she can hold it in her hands.  Because it's classical music, it's not as irritating for me to listen to as some of her other toys.",5,1
"Skip Hop Duo Deluxe, Black","I have two expensive diaper bags and hated using them for everyday use.  I have to take his filled bottles to daycare and neither bag had enough pockets.  This bag fits two Dr. Brown's bottles in each INSULATED front pocket and can fit another in the mesh side pocket.  Also, it doesn't tip over so I never have to worry about the contents spilling out.  The magnetic closures are great too.  Nice and quiet when the baby is sleeping and if I'm down to one hand I don't have to fool with a zipper.  It's my perfect daily daycare bag:  4 bottles, 2 change of clothes, nursing cover, a few diapers, wipes case, medicine, and there's still room.",5,1
"Skip Hop Duo Deluxe, Black",Could not have found a more perfect diaper bag! Spacious enough for my two kids and myself - anything I need for the day! Clips right in to my stroller and comfortable carry strap if needed. Absolutely love the fabric and the magnetic closures.,5,1
"Skip Hop Duo Deluxe, Black","I looked at this bag among many others before I finally made a decision to go with this bag. I feel like I made the perfect choice. The bag is really roomy with lots of pockets to keep everything organized and I carry A LOT of stuff with me. Honestly the only thing I wish is that it came in purple because that is my favorite color. I do like the stripes since they are so bright, but I think the colors feel more 'boy' than 'girl'. Other than that though, I have nothing bad to say about this bag, and if they ever DO come in purple, I guarantee I will be purchasing another.",5,1
"BabySmart Cooshee Booster Seat Hybak with Travel Bag, Onyx",This is a great product. Its durable and the perfect height for my 2 year old. Unfortunately it was way too wide and deep to fit on my chair. I'm returning it for the original version.,4,1
"American Baby Company 3-Piece Cotton Percale Porta-Mini Crib Set, White","This set said it is for a mini crib, but it (the bumper) was a bit big for mine. I &#34;rigged&#34; it to fit, meaning I had to tie the sides to the side of the crib to the outside because of the length. The blanket is beautiful and very soft. The sheet fit perfectly to the mattress in my mini crib. Overall, not a bad deal. I got it for the bumper, but the bumper is too long.",4,1
"Pearhead Time Frame, Mahogany","I used it for my K-12 pics of kids and put the Grade 12 Grad pic in the large opening. I started top left with K, then went right and circled back to Gr 11 being in spot on bottom just before the Gr 12 Grad pic. Perfect.",5,1
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Percale Portable/Mini Crib Bumper, White","The bumper is not very padded, so my son has bonked his head a few times. He didn't cry as it was not a hard hit, but you can tell by the sound that his head hit the wood frame on the crib. If you are planning on getting this to protect your kid from any hard hits, look elsewhere. It's a soft pad that keeps the warmth in the crib, helps with hands and feet not getting stuck between rails and potentially causing serious damage (broken arm?), but it's not perfect.My son had figured out how to lower the bumper and does so only when awake. It's no big deal, but it was not exactly what I had expected when I ordered it. I expected more padding, but I digress. I is serving it's purpose nicely.",4,1
Booginhead SippiGrip - Blue,my one year old loves to throw his sippy cup. This is perfect for when we go to restaurants to keep from having to clean the sippy. We hook the handled end up to his booster seat instead of his wrist.,5,1
"Valco Baby Hitch Hiker Ride On Board, Black","I purchased this Ride On Board after reading two other reviews that this works with the Combi Twin Sport Stroller. I can verify that those two reviewers were correct. It works great! I have a 3.5 year old, 18 month old, and will have a new baby arriving in about a month. I was not interested in triple strollers. They are so big and bulky. Also, my 3.5 year old is perfectly capable of walking at his age. But I understand that he won't always want to. That's what interested me in this Ride On Board.Installation:It took me (at 8 months pregnant) about 15 minutes to put together and install. The instructions aren't the greatest, but it's not hard to figure out from the pictures provided. I installed it on the left side of the Combi. The reason for this is the infant carseat can only go on the right. When the infant carseat is attached, the seat must be reclined, which will be right in the child's face who is riding on the Ride On Board. I don't think attaching it to the right side would be a good idea unless you do not plan to recline that seat. My 18 month old will be in the left seat, so I'm fine with not reclining it. There is plenty of room for the diaper bag to hang on my side (I have posted a photo of this in the user photos.)Storage & Removal:It's not difficult to remove. You can still fold the Combi without removing the Ride On Board attachments that are now installed on the stroller. You cannot fold the Combi with the board completely attached. There is a strap included to fold the Ride On Board upward and store it that way. This won't work if you want to fold the Combi, but if your child decides they want to walk and you don't want this in your way when you're walking in the middle of the stroller, the strap is nice for that.Overall I am very glad I purchased this item. I think it's going to be a great addition to our double stroller so that we do not need a triple stroller.",5,1
Skip Hop Via Messenger Diaper Bag Black,"I love this diaper bag as I found it pretty, sleek and very versatile.I can fit on it diapers, bottles, wipes, food, formula, clothes and toys!Perfect for travel as it is not that bulky even when full. The magnet close for the lap it's very convenient when you have your hands full!I bought it a little bit over a year ago, and I used it every single day. After a year, the stap broke and an internal pocket ripped. I contacted Skip*Hop customer service and they shipped one new bag to me as the garantee will cover any defects. 100% satisfied customer!",5,1
"Medela Contact Nipple Shield, Small","This is what allowed me to nurse my baby, plain and simple.  The size and the cutout were perfect and solves the problem the hospital-provided one didn't. I used it until my baby was about six months old, at which point he began removing it himself-no weaning period necessary.  I do recommend using it with the guidance of a lactation consultant.  But I really needed it and had no problems.  I had four because they are easy to misplace and I didn't want to have to wash after every feeding.",5,1
No-Compromise Organic Cotton Ultra - 1 Twin Mattress,"We're happy with the purchase of this mattress for our toddler.  The organic attributes are nice to have in mind, and indeed the mattress arrived without many of the odors/vapors commonly sniffed with conventional mattresses.  Nice to know it comes inherently with a mite-proof/water-proof cover.  Saves one the cost of ordering an additional zip-over cover.  Ordering through Amazon and delivery was easy.  The mattress was shipped by a third-party and delivered to our door.  The deliveryman called ahead to coordinate a drop-off and he was right on time.  The fact that shipping was free, as per Amazon's general policy, was very nice.  Only downside to the mattress, as other reviewers have noted, has to do with comfort.  This is not a particularly luxurious mattress.  It is on the firm side, but also has a quavering sort of wobbliness to it also, perhaps owing to the fact that it's a spring-based mattress.  In short, you don't really feel like you're sleeping on a bed of feathers, nor on a solid board, but something sort of like a board balanced on basketballs.  Kind of hard to describe.  Then again, I could see having a perfectly decent night's sleep on it, and our toddler seems to be fine with it.  Overall, seems within the realm of organic/""healthy"" mattresses, this is a solid product, and with free delivery, not a bad deal.",4,1
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Papagayo Upholstered Rocking Chair, Green",perfect size for an active one year old!  soft and inviting chair where she sits and ""reads"" and hugs her dolls and even watches TV with PopPop.,5,1
Sugar Booger &quot;Vroom&quot; Feeding Collection Sippy Cup,"This sippy cup isn't perfect, but it is the best one I have found.  The main selling point for me is how simple it is.  No little parts for mold and bacteria to get caught in.  Lightweight, fun patterns.  Occasionally one of the cups has a lid that is a significantly different size than all the others we already have.  Dropping it on a hard floor can crack the cup.  In an ideal world it wouldn't be plastic.  The cup can spill from the spout if it gets knocked over, but it spills very slowly - worth the tradeoff of not having a difficult drinking valve.",5,1
Sugar Booger &quot;Vroom&quot; Feeding Collection Silverware Set,Exactly as advertised. No damage very fast shipping. Nothing less than professional service. Perfect gift for the tot who is ready to graduate to big kid silverware.,5,1

"American Baby Company Waterproof Embossed Quilt-Like Flat Crib Protective Pad Cover, White","This mat is perfect and exactly what I expected. it lies on top of the mat, fits perfectly. The material feels good (of course sheet goes on top of it). Not sure why some of the negative reviews as this is perfect.",5,1
Evenflo X Sport Plus Convenience Stroller - Christina,These strollers are easy to handle and very light weight. We have a 2 1/2 and 1 1/2 year old. We have a double stroller but those are hard to manipulate in heavy traffic zones. We went on a vacation to Sea World and Legoland and these strollers were perfect for moving around the park. The only downside is not much storage underneath but you can't have everything. Also the adjustable handle length is nice because I am 1 foot taller than my wife and being able to slide the handles out just the 3 or 4 inches extra really saves the lower back.,5,1
Modern Toddler Cot,We got this bed and im a matter of 90 mins my husband was able to put it together. It's very easy to assemble. Our 21 month old son loves this bed. It's easy for him to get in and out of bed w/o needing mom and dad's help. He hasn't fallen out and God knows he's rolls around ALOT in his sleep! I love it because its easy to clean and change the bed sheets out of it. His Serta crib mattress fits perfectly and we have no need to stuff anything anywhere for it to fit! LOVE THIS BED!,5,1
"babyletto Mercer 3-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Two Tone","I received this crib a few weeks ago and it went together easily.  I really like that the screw holes are preset with metal pieces so that the construction is metal to metal instead of the usual particle board construction of metal to wood.  The crib should be easier to take apart and put together multiple times.  I agree with other reviewers that the drawer is a bit flimsy and not as well-constructed as the rest of the crib.  It will be more than sufficient for what we need it for (larger, seldom-used items).Overall, its a great looking, solidly-constructed crib.  The wood is soft, but we bought it knowing that this was a risk.  Our preference was for a solid wood, rather than particle board, crib.  This was one trade-off that we had to consider.There were a number of comments about mattresses not fitting.  We bought aColgate Classica III Foam Crib Mattress, Whiteand it fits perfectly.",5,1
"Niermann Standby Mobile, Sailboats","I love this mobile. When I opened the box I was pleasantly surprised to find the boats, bouy, and sun, we're larger than I expected. It is perfect in my sons room and gently twirls when the fan is moving or it is spun by hand.  I had to hang it using a small hook in the cieling since I didn't want to use a mobile stand.",5,1
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Papagayo Switch Plate Cover, Green",As with all lambs and Ivy products this is high quility. Its not some flappy platict thing. It is hard and durable. I will say i wasn't impressed with the screws that came with it. The were two different colors and i expected them to match the cover. And if you do the wall border in the middle of the wall this will kind of get lost in it. However it fits perfect on the wall. It pops off the wall about a quarter of an inch which is nice for the night feedings when your trying to find the light. Over all very cute and worth the money!!!,5,1
Ergo Backpack Camel,"The first one of these that I ordered arrived broken, and the second one isn't quite what's pictured here.  Maybe the design was updated as the returned and new ones crossed paths?  Who knows.  The new one has lightly padded shoulder straps, and I have ended up switching to using it as the primary diaper bag, and emptying it out for hiking trips and walks to the park.  It connects fairly well to the ergo carrier, although it only has two connection points - one around each shoulder strap of the ergo.  I think the ""old"" one looked like it may have had four.  It flops a little, but not too bad.  My main complaint is that it hangs a lot lower than I'd like, and the drink pocket on the side is at perfect grabbing height for my 18 month old (this could be good or bad, depending on your outlook - I don't like it b/c I end up getting bonked in the head with his water bottles, or having to retrieve them from the ground).  It's not laid out as well as a traditional diaper bag, but it definitely holds everything we need it to with room to spare.",4,1
Little Giraffe Chenille Blanky - Celadon,"I love, love, love the Little Giraffe 14&#34; blankys.  My daughter took hers everywhere with her when she was little and they wash well and stay in good shape (there is eventually some shrinkage).  It's the perfect size for them to carry without dragging on the floor.  Our daughter still has one in her bed now (2.5) and it has been her favorite comforter during teething, at preschool etc.I have purchased many of these for friends and family who are expecting and have only had good feedback.",5,1
Bright Starts License to Drool Teether,My son is 27 mos and is Developmentally delayed. He is in a stage where he only cares for keys and wants to chew on everything he grabs. These keys have been perfect! They even make somewhat of a clacking noise. These are a great set of toy keys - if I would add anything it would be vibration /music and lights.,5,1
"Bright Starts Rattle and Shake Barbell Rattle, Pretty in Pink","This is one of those toys that's just perfect for a baby about 3-4 months old.  It's a perfect fit for small hands, colorful so they can track the item and the noise keeps them engaged.  It's been a hit for all of my children, and the good thing is, it's inexpensive so you can afford to buy a few of them, keep one in the diaper bag, and one at home.",5,1
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Blue and White (Previous Model)","I was given these as a shower gift, and now I give them as a gift for every shower I go to! Mothers like to share good secrets! These muslin wraps really are the perfect swaddler blanket. The blanket is so large (47""x47""), that it makes swaddling extremely easy. What I love, is that it allows you to swaddle the baby tightly but comfortably so they don't move around or roll over. My baby sleeps with her arms out and they wrap around her so nicely. I love that they are breathable muslin, I feel very safe leaving it in the crib with her. I am still using these swaddlers for our daughter who is now 7 months old. I don't know how a smaller blanket (such as a receiving blanket that others use) could work this good. A bonus is that they are extremely soft too! Another use for these large soft blankets are to use them as a cover over the stroller or car seat to block the sun, but at the same time it lets the air through. I have one set aside for outdoor & car use, it goes with me everywhere. A MUST HAVE FOR ALL BABIES.** My daughter is now 21 month and her swaddle wrap has turned into her ""Blankie""- she loves it!**",5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Toddler","I just got two of these little brushes for my twins who just turned a year old.  Up til now we'd had a terrible time trying to get in their mouths for cleaning, especially with them teething.  My boy twin let me put the soft bristles of this toothbrush right on his gums & teeth!  He was even able to hold the toothbrush and stuck it in his mouth himself!  Needless to say I LOVE these little brushes.  They are the perfect size not only for my twinnies little mouths but also for their little hands!  The handle is flexible and the bristles are very soft and the banana shape & color are fun and get the kids' attention.  I think this is must have for anyone with toddlers!",5,1
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel",My cousin bought me this baby carrier for my newborn daughter from China. It works perfect for her now when she's just 20 days old and 8 lbs of weight. There's no need of additional insert for babies of her body length I guess. She was born of 20 inches long and 7lbs 9oz. Glad to see my little daughter sleeps inside of the carrier comfortably and snuggly with proper support on her bottoms and head. I never expected this plain-structured sack would work so well for a fussy newborn baby. But it does a good job to soothe her. Also I can lay her down easily without waking her up. It's amazing!,5,1
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel","I love love love this baby carrier. It's an absolute life saver and a major must have for baby products. This beats all baby carriers especially the Bjorn. It is soooo comfortable for me and my 6' 240+ lb husband to use (I', 5'4"" 120 lb). I don't get any of the neck and shoulder tension that the Bjorn causes. Especially once my baby hit 3 months at 15 lbs the Bjorn was useless. The Ergo is also perfect for nursing - I just cover her head with my shawl and we walk around while she eats. It is very discreet. At firt, I was interested in the Beco Baby carrier, which was so cute and seemed pretty practical. Anyway, I tried that on at a store as well as the Ergo - the Ergo won hands down!! The Ergo is much more simpler to put on although it does not have cute patterns like the Beco, which is fine becuase my husband is not into wearing flowers :) Anyway, my daughter is now almost 9 months weighs over 20 lbs and she still fits in it perfectly - either on my back or front (the back position is my fav). Also, my 30 lb 3 yr old fits in it too. We walked 1.5 miles at Disneyland with my 3 year old on my back and we were both very comfortable the whole time. This is the best product and best investment all parents must invest in!!",5,1
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel","I've been looking for a great carrier for my newborn.  This carrier is phenomenal.  What's really great is it will grow as she grows.  So many of the other carriers seem to be limited.  It's very comfortable and breathes.  The ""hood"" that's attached is perfect for blocking out the sun for my baby and snaps onto the shoulder straps so it doesn't slip.  The Ergo Carrier comes with easy to follow instructions for front, back, side carry instructions.  The front pouch is also great for a little burp cloth that's easy to grab.  This carrier makes it easy to carry my baby but also leave my hands free!",5,1
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel","I love my Ergo!  I love my Ergo!  I love my Ergo!  I'm expecting my third child and look forward to carrying him in his hand-me-down Ergo baby carrier.  This item was a life-saver with my second child who always needed to be held.  She lived in it for 18 months.  Unfortunately, I didn't invest in our Ergo until my oldest was a toddler, but he got plenty of use out of it as a large two-year old.  It was perfect for when his fat little legs would tire from walking.  I wish I could afford to buy half a dozen more so I could have color choices, but since this is my last child I'm stuck with our one well-loved carrier.  I had tried several carriers with my first child and the Ergo is the best.  My next favorite was the simple pouch slings from Kangaroo Korner.  I used my pouch for my oldest and then my second child until she grew into the Ergo, around three months.  Neither of my babies cared for the Bjorn, nor facing out and I didn't think it was as comfortable anyways, if that offers any comparison for anyone.",5,1

Chariot 2011 Cabriolet Bicycle Trailer **CLOSEOUT**,"We were looking for a bike trailer.  JUST a bike trailer.  We wanted something that was comfy for the kids with room to grow, something that would hold up well and resell well.  In the world of Chariots, the Cougar seems to be the one that is sought out.  I personally did not care for the Cougar for a few reasons - the cost, the bike arm not being included (seriously how many people buy a Chariot and do NOT use it as a bike trailer?), the lack of storage (you can't really put heavy stuff in the pouch), and the name.  Seriously.  Cougar?  OK that's a dumb reason but I am not a Cougar and I would feel icky owning a stroller called the Cougar.I understand that you can change your trailer into a stroller but I don't know why you would want to.  Even if I had started this adventure with my first child, I am not sure that the multi-use features would appeal to me.  I am now on my 4th child, and I have strollers I like very much.  I can't see a bike trailer ever really filling the niche of stroller for me.  It lacks recline, it lacks a good sun shade, it just wouldn't be my thing.  I can see some appeal to using the trailer to cross country ski, if that's your thing.  The hiking feature is really flat out strange to me - why not just use a frame carrier? - but if that's your thing, great.  The reason I am pointing all these things out is, if you DO want to do some of these things - the stroller thing especially - this is really probably not the trailer for you because it does not have a parking break.  I can't fathom a stroller with no parking break.  But as I said, we wanted a bike trailer.  So for us that does not matter.First, the things I like about this trailer.  It is well constructed.  It has some room in back for storage - it would be nice if there was more, but you can fit two gallon jugs of water and a fair bit more of soft stuff, clothes, food, whatever.  The Chariot website gives this trailer a crazy tiny amount of headroom - 23 inches? - but my more or less average 3 1/2 year old twins fit inside with room to grow and I do expect this to hold two 5 year olds.  (Not with helmets but I think we are going to be in the no helmets in the trailer camp - we're not planning this for commuting or anywhere a colision is likely to occur)  It is wide enough that the kids are quite comfortable.  The seat is nicely padded and comfortable for the kids - I have had a number of kids of various ages, including my 8yo son, get in to give me an opinion (yes, oddly, he fits).  There is lots of leg room.  The pouches for the kids are placed so they are out of the child's space while sitting, but easily reached (ie in the foot area not the lap area).  The harnesses are easy to adjust and easy to use, comfortable and secure for the child (a U-shaped harness drops over the child, so you won't have that wiggle one arm thing out happening).  It folds fairly easily and doesn't take up much space with the wheels off.  It is light (24 pounds vs. 28ish for the Cougar 2 or Burley D'lite).  The arm attaches to the bike with a ball and socket mechanism which gives the trailer freedom of movement while still allowing it to follow the bike and pull very easily.  The price is low, for a quality trailer.  In so many ways, it's an awesome little trailer.Now for the bad.  The screen that covers the front is sort of a shower cap design with elastic edges.  It looks sloppy and if your kids are like mine you know they will be shoving their hands out, pulling the cover aside.  Elastic wears out over time, and I would prefer a more snug, tailored edge to the cover for that reason.  It connects to the bottom using plastic buckles which require two hands to operate.  The rain part merely rolls down and velcros across the bottom, and the whole affair really just looks sloppy.  On the plus side, it is easily removed should you wish to forgo it.  (I think all the Chariots have this sloppy elastic edged cover thing going on, but the cross country line attaches with a more one-handed function) The trunk or storage space is, as mentioned, small (better than the Cougar but not as big as a Burley) and is partly taken up by the metal frame that serves as the folding mechanism.  The top of the trailer is open (or see through) which seems great on a day that is not too sunny, for the kids to see up and out, but not great if you want to keep your little ones out of the sun.  The back flap lifts up and over to serve as a sun shade but it is a very half-rear-ended measure.  It does not come with a safety flag and has only one reflector which might be enough but it makes it look unfinished, like it is missing something.  There are two holes for reflectors, but only one reflector.  And finally, it has no handlebar.  Even if you don't wish to use this for a stroller, a handlebar would make it SO much easier to move around when not attached to a bike.  To get a handlebar, you have to buy a stroller kit, which is a fair chunk of change - I am thinking I could craft something with PVC to fill the need of pulling it around easier.  It lacks a suspension system but for most people, the 20-inch air filled tires plus give of the fabric seat will provide a smooth enough ride that this won't be an issue.If you are set on a Chariot and you don't wish to use your trailer as a stroller, this little guy will serve you well.  It's not perfect, but it's got a lot going for it for the price.",4,1
"Dream On Me Classic Sleigh Toddler Bed, White",This works perfectly for my two year old. Its quite low to the floor so it is easy for him to climb in and out of.,5,1
"Dream On Me Classic Sleigh Toddler Bed, White",My daughter and I picked this bed out online together.  She picked pink of course because it is one of her favorite colors.  Once it got here she was so excited to have her big girl bed.  It's perfect for a first bed because you don't have to worry about them getting in and out because it's so low to the ground.  The little side rails help keep them from rolling out too.  The only downside is she sometimes wants me or her father to lay in the bed with her but it only allows up to 50 lbs so that won't be able to happen but otherwise great bed & great price.,4,1
"ERGObaby Front Pouch, Camel","I bought this bag to accompany the Ergo Baby Carrier, but it has been used soooo much more than just an add-on accessory.As an accessory to the Ergo Carrier, it works perfectly. Its large velcro strap securely and snugly fits the Ergo Carrier, where it's super handy to access all your things, yet it's secure against you. It doesn't look big but adds HUGE amounts of space for your things.As a stand-alone bag, it's equally fantastic. When you click on the shoulder strap, you have a proper purse in an extremely durable fabric that lasts & lasts. I've had mine for 3 years and it's showing no signs of wear. The shoulder strap is adjustable and long enough to go cross-ways across your body, making it safer still.It's very roomy, though it doesn't look it, and all the pockets make it such a handy bag, both for ever-day use and for traveling. The outside zipper pocket has an inside key/phone clip. The open pocket is perfect for my phone or keys or shopping list, and the main pocket holds way more stuff than you'd think possible, including my large, long wallet. The inside zipper pocket holds private stuff. The bag is canvas, so it's sturdy yet squishable, so in addition to all the pockets/features, you can stuff it in your luggage wherever there's a small space, and it still looks great while keeping all of your things together.My only complaint is that the large logo patch on the front is ugly; they need to be a little more understated.Bottom line: Very well designed, this bag is tremendous value for money, certainly a must-have for the Ergo Carrier, but even stand-alone, it is fantastic.",5,1
"ERGObaby Front Pouch, Camel","This is perfect to use as a small purse while on short trips out.  It isn't super fashionable, but is totally functional and useful.  When it's full to the brim, it hangs a little low, but it has never bothered me.  I keep everything in this pouch, then stick it into a purse when I go out sans-baby.  The velcro attachment is still super strong after months of daily use.",5,1
ERGO Baby Back Pack - Black,"I love my Ergo and the back pack just makes it that much better. It's not super big but it is big enough to handle spare clothing, toys and cloth diapers and related items for 2. Perfect for a day trip!",5,1
Boppy 100% Organic Cotton Slipcover,"Super soft, nice for baby, machine washes nicely.  Stretchy cotton material.  I have two and one can be washed as I am using the other. Very nice light green on bottom side.  Fits my boppy perfectly.",5,1
Medela 9 Volt Vehicle Lighter Adaptor,I needed this for a 4 day road trip I was taking with my 3 month old and our breast pump.  It worked perfectly.  I didn't notice any kind of change in power or frequency when using the car adapter as opposed to being plugged in at home.  Worked great and is super helpful to have on the road!  Highly recommended.- Ken's wife.  :),5,1
"Pearhead Babyprints Keepsake, Year-Round","I didn't buy this through Amazon the first time around but I have it on my wish list for a near future purchase.  There seems to be a lot of complaints about perfect circles and difficulty with the material but I've bought 3 so far and you get the hang of it if you use some patience.  And the best part is, you get to keep working with it till you're happy with what you've got.  I didn't get perfection and perfect circles but, they were good enough and to tell you the truth, the whole reason for getting it in the first place was to have a keepsake of my grandchildren's hands and THAT'S what I notice when I look at it.  I even got 2 for my parents and flattened the ""clay"" out thinner than it's supposed to be so that it could be rolled into a big enough circle for their hands to make imprints and I can't tell you how glad I am that I did that.  I lost my Dad 2 years ago and now I've got this precious keepsake of his handprint that I sometimes place my own hand over.  Don't let imperfect circles and impatience keep you from getting this great keepsake.  Even if it doesn't come out well at all in the end, you'll have those precious imprints forever.PS I love that it's this soft material that won't break if you drop it when it's finished.",5,1
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","My toddler son loves his new car seat! I did a lot of research and chose this one over the Britax Frontier. My son was in a booster for the last year as he is above average for height and weight but after a friend's son died recently in a car accident, I did some research and realized he needed to be in a 5 point harness for as long as possible. This one keeps him in a harness until 65 pounds and had higher safety ratings over the Britax (although the Britax harness holds up to 85 pounds which was appealing). Ultimately, because of the better safety ratings and the lower price ($137 for the Graco and $240 for the Britax) and the smaller footprint I bought 2 of the Gracos. I was worried about the crotch strap not fitting, as others have mentioned. Not the case with my son, even though he is bigger than your average 3 year old! I moved the crotch strap to the second position and I followed the manual word for word when setting up the seat, and it is awesome and I have no complaints. He fits perfect and has plenty of room to grow. He loves the toy cubbies and the cup holder. I definitely recommend this seat and am so happy with my purchase!!! Btw the seats I received were manufactured in March of 2012.Update: I loved this seat so much I ordered a 3rd Nautilus... one each for our two cars, and one for grandma.  Now I know he'll be safe with her as well!",5,1
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","We purchased this carseat for our very tall child when he outgrew his Britax Marathon at age of three.  We were looking for a seat that still had a 5 point harness and would continue to grow with him.  This seat has been perfect for us.  He is now about to turn 5 years old and is still in the 5 pt harness which is the safest way for them to be in the car for as long as possible.  The headrest has been easy to adjust for his height and when he outgrows the 5 pt harness the seatbelt guides will place the seat belt into the correct position so it does not rub his neck.  Also love the headrest when he falls asleep on long road trips.  We have three of these, one for each of our cars and Grandma too.  It will be the last carseat that we need to buy for him since it will convert to a highback then low back booster seat.",5,1
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","This is an excellent car seat! I looked at some reviews on consumer reports and this one was rated very highly. It may be a little pricy, but well worth it. It can later be converted into a booster seat. We got this for my daughter for Christmas and we really didn't think she would think it was a big deal, but when we took it out of the box and put it on the floor, she climbed right into the seat to sit in it. She knew it was for her and she knew it was a perfect fit for her. And when we installed it in our car, she was loving it! It was a whole new experience for her sitting forward and seeing everything mom and dad was seeing. Excellent seat and the cup holder is handy too. :)",5,1
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",My almost 4 year old grew out of her britax about 6 months ago when we bought this mostly because of her height. This carseats accommodates her height and her weight (skinny little bigger) perfectly.,5,1
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","My daughter loves this carseat, she talks about it all the time. She is kinda small for her age so we waited for her 4th birthday to get it (she is only 30lbs), and she fits perfectly in it with loads of room to grow. I truly did not want to buy a $20 cheap booster seat, and I am super happy with this seat.",5,1
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",This car seat is great! I needed to buy a new one for my son because his old one was too small he still needed a five point harness but there weren't many to choose from. This one is perfect i can still use the five point harness and adjust the seat hight because he is taller.,5,1
Baby's Cozy World Microfiber &amp; Fleece Carrier Cover - Navy Blue,"These have been very helpful when taking my twin sons out to their dr appointments and such.  At first we were trying to cover them with blankets and they kept blowing off - not a fun time when you're carrying 2 carriers!  Then we tried putting them in snowsuits - big mistake.  They were sweating so bad their clothing was drenched!  These covers work perfect!  I just dress them normally, and they stay nice and cozy.  No need for coats and hats (which they hate to wear).  Great product!",5,1
Doidy Cup - Red color,"We love this cup. Despite the price (rather expensive for a plastic cup), I bought the doidy cup, because I was curious if it would work. And it does!!  Our 8 month old picked the cup up and sipped his yoghurt without any problems. He does not have to bend over backwards anymore to empty it like he does with his sippy cups. He can keep his head straight and drink from the cup. The handles appeared too small when I opened the box, but they are actually the perfect size for his small hands and fingers.",5,1
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,After receiving many many blankets for my baby- these are pretty much the only ones that I use now that baby is about 4 months old. The others are just too small. The weight is perfect and so so soft. I would recommend looking for the design that is on sale though.,5,1
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,"These swaddle wraps are absolutely perfect.  They seem a little thicker than the normal swaddles from A&A. And the colors, oh the colors!  They are so vibrant and beautiful!  The more ""girl"" colors my daughter has scooped up, and she loves it. My son, who will be here any day now will get the more ""boy"" colors.  But I am no where near disappointed.  The price is well worth it. Glad I finally purchased these!",5,1
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,"I use these for everything. Living in Texas, these are perfectly light. Use them on the stroller to keep the sun out or wrap them up at the beach while they are sleeping. They are breathable and beautiful!",5,1
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,"I got these for my 1 year old son who LOVES dragging a blanket around with him, but is also a hot sleeper.  These are PERFECT!, they are large, but very light weight, and exactly what he needed!",5,1
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,"I purchased these after reading all the positive reviews and I'm glad I did.  My son loved being swaddled but after about the 3rd week of his life all those receiving blankets get too small so I started looking for something else.  These are just the right size!  Even after we stopped swaddling he still loves his blanket.  He get;s really hot when he sleeps, so these are perfect because they aren't too heavy.  I've also bought these for baby shower gifts.  THey are kind of expensive but they are long lasting.  I've had them for 6 months now and they have been washed A LOT, and they are holding up perfectly.  I also used these as nursing covers and liked them better than the aprons because they are so light, and big enough to cover myself.  They are a great purchase!  PS Make sure you look at he product description as mentioned in other reviews.  I bought the 47x47 and they are a great size.",5,1
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,Was looking for the perfect muslin swaddle wrap and I'm so glad I bought these. Very soft and breathable fabric. Lets hope my lil one loves it as much as I do :)Highly recommend.,5,1
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,"I LOVE these blankets. I was skeptical, thinking ""Do I really need expensive swaddle blankets?""  The answer? I bought 4 more as they are in constant use. They are light, breathable and soft.  The lightness will be perfect for summer, but I doubled the blankets to use in the winter.  The blanket rolls up so small, one is constantly in my diaper bag.  I've started using this instead of my nursing cover, and I think it even works better. My colicky baby only sleeps with her eyes covered, and with the breathable nature of these blankets, I'm much more comfortable to swaddle her with a little ""hood"" to cover her eyes (don't worry, she's well monitored!).  The generous size is key, too.  It makes it so easy to swaddle.  When my baby was a newborn, I folded them in half to form a triangle and swaddled that way, but now she's bigger, I fold down the top corner.  There's plenty of room.  I'm sure I can still swaddle her up to a year, if she needs it (like her brother did!) Also, check out ""Double Swaddle"" on youtube, as recommended by another reviewer.  It's a great way to secure the wiggly older babies who still enjoy swaddling for sleep.  I say, go for it!",5,1

Child Airplane Travel Harness - Cares Safety Restraint System - The Only FAA Approved Child Flying Safety Device,"We use these whenever we fly. We have one for each kid and they are perfect!

We Sell Mats Anti-Fatigue 6 Piece Interlocking EVA Foam Flooring Set,"These mats go everywhere with me. The cushioning is perfect on my hardwood floor, the concrete in my yard, and I even put them under my child's baby pool for extra cushion. They are wipeable for easy clean up as we almost always have spills, sneezes, and other stuff....on them. I put them down and take them a part each use, they still connect well. I have read other reviews where people are concerned that the outter edges become loose or can be torn away from the mat....this will happen with any mat of this nature. My daughter likes waving them around so I don't mind her playing with them, if it bothers you, take the perimeter edge off and you're good to go. Well worth the money and I will be buying more.",5,1

"Baby Doll Bedding White Bassinet Mattress, 13X29",I was worried this was not going to fit in a 30 year old bassinet but it fits perfectly.  The dimensions are as advertised and it's 2 inches thick.  I definitely recommend!,5,1
"My Brest Friend Slipcover, Leaf","An extra slipcover is absolutely necessary for those first few months. You never know what is going to come out of that little baby, and this cover is perfect backup for bodily fluid catastrophes! Great fit, and with a little practice, easy to put on.",5,1
"Bummis Super Brite Diaper Cover, Pink, 8-16 Pounds",I love these! My son only weighs 14.5 lbs but I bought the medium size and they work perfectly. We use a gerber premium prefold underneath and have yet to have a single leak. I wish I had bought more!,5,1
"Bummis Super Brite Diaper Cover, Pink, 8-16 Pounds","My son was born 4 weeks early so was small.  Before he was born I had purchased some Thirsties covers in a couple different sizes.  They worked ok, but were very bulky for him.  These super brite covers were the only ones I found that came in a really small size, the 4-9 pound size.  I use Bummis prefolds and this size matches up perfectly with their 4-9 lb size prefold.  I find they do work better if I close the diaper with a snappi rather than just fold it inside the diaper.  I don't find that they leak, even over night, but the fabric around the legs and on the inside front does get wet.  I usually switch back and forth between a couple covers for a few changings so one can dry while another one is on.  Then put them both in the diaper pail after a couple changings.  I plan to order more of these in the next size up when I need them.",4,1

Clevamama Baby Safety Oven Door Guard,"I bought this from the UK only to discover that they have it on the .com site now but I have to say I am not sorry.  My lively little one, who is obviously very pretty, loves to look at herself in the mirror and the stove is a perfect height to her.  When I turn the light on iy is more interesting.  This screen is absolutely perfect and totally practical and sooooo easy to mount.  It covers the glass of my stove door which is the part that gets the hottest perfectly.I highly recommend this product.",5,1
Prince Lionheart bebePOD Tray Kit,"I love the tray. Was easy to use, clean up and perfect for my daughter. I would like to be able to buy more of the mats if they're sold separately. This way I could have multiple ones to use. Other than that the tray is great!",5,1

Redmon Fun and Fitness Exercise Equipment for Kids - Tread Mill,"This is a very solid piece of kids equipment.. No plastic parts here. The frame is made of real metal, and is extremely sturdy and well built.Its like a real miniature workout bench! I do wish the bench was adjustable, but its no big deal.My son is only 2 1/2 so its perfect for him, but I can see it being a little small for bigger kinds.But well worth the price.. I highly recommend!",5,1
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White","Easy to install, perfect color and they keep my daughter from sticking her arms and legs through the slats in her crib.",5,1
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White","My son would wake up screaming because his arm or leg would be caught in his crib and he didn't know how to move and get it back inside. The breathable bumper helped this problem a lot and there was no worry about suffocation. They bumpers do slip down no matter how tight you tie the strings, so that is an issue. Also, the bumpers do not reach all the way around my crib (Child of Mine 3 in 1 Convertible Crib) so there is a gap about 3 spokes wide. It isn't a big deal and we placed it near the &#34;head&#34; of the crib where he never seems to sleeping. I would re-buy the product again, but it isn't perfect.",4,1
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White",ITS PERFECT! EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED AND WAS LOOKING FOR. VERY IMPRESSIVE. PERFECT MATERIAL. I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY.,5,1
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White","I purchased this bumper for my 16 month old daughter's crib. I was rather happy with it considering some of the negative reviews I read before ordering it. Like others mentioned, there ends up being two gaps since the bumper is not one solid piece. I end up putting a stuffed animal in each corner. This bumper is very easy to assemble. It fits my slatted sleigh crib perfectly. This bumper allows room for adjustment as well.",5,1
JJ Cole Collections Strap Cover in Pink,"These strap covers are adorable.  They're soft and pretty and go perfectly with my 14 month old's car seat.  We have one car seat that came with strap covers and another that didn't.  It's brown and pink and so the pink JJ Cole strap covers match perfectly.  I used the car seat without any strap covers for several months, but I did not like how they were digging into her neck.  I am glad I purchased these.  Easy to put on, durable, washable, soft, and cute!",5,1
Trend Lab Paisley Park 4 Piece Crib Set,"It went perfect with the stencil set we had.  This was the only bedding set we found that matched.  I like that the bumper pieces have several ties to tie to the crib.  We haven't got to test it out yet since baby hasn't arrived, but the sheet fits very snug on our mattress.  We are very pleased with this purchase.",5,1
"Trend Lab Blue Puppy Character Hooded Towel,Puppy","Good quality,  so cute on !Our grandson looks adorable in thistowel. Perfect for the beach or the bath!",5,1
Sevi Instrument Toy Set 8 Piece,"I was looking for musical instruments to help my young daughter appreciate music making.  I wanted actual child-sized instruments (not toys)that could stand up to a child's use.  I looked at many items that were either too advanced for my young one, or too flimsy and poorly made.  These instruments by Sevi, fit the bill perfectly.  They are all wooden (except for the triangle), colorful, and beautifully made.  The colors are vegetable based (safe for young fingers & mouths) and the construction is durable.  They actually make music!  I will purchase other Sevi products with confidence!",4,1
"Bunnies by the Bay Wee Plush, Ittybit","I bought this as part of a baby shower gift, and right up until the last instant I wanted desperately to grab it out of the basket of toys, sneak it into my handbag and take it home! It's that adorably squishy and cute and just perfect.My recommendation: just give in to fate and buy too, one for yourself--no matter what your age--and one for the lucky kid intended to receive it. You will never regret that move!",5,1
Medela Freestyle Breast Pump,"Ok, I have and used the Pump and Style model for over year with my last child. Don't get me wrong I liked that one a lot (also from Medela), but with my newest baby who is now three months old, let me just say I think this model is far superior. I saw a few other reviews that said that this model is not as strong, and I could not disagree more. This coming from a woman that opts for the highest setting on both model. Not only did I not see a difference, but this model may even stronger. The pump and style is built into the bag, so your forced to bring everything with you when you pump... Not convenient. There is also no timer on the pump and style, that gets old unless you pump in the same place all the time with a clock that you can see all hours of the day. I also did not like that you either had to plug it in, or buy batteries. Who would want to buy batteries, you would spend a ton of money on just that over time. The freestyle is great because of the rechargeable batteries, and charger it has. Plus its small, and super portable with a timer built in. You can take it anywhere easy, perfect for the mom going back to work.",5,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Organic 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Natural","Our baby girl really enjoys being snug while she sleeps, weather night time sleep or naps. This product has really helped us out. We were never really good at 'swaddling' no matter how hard we tried, she would wiggle out of it, but she will not sleep when her arms were free, it was like the 'jolts' babies do when they are young, would wake her up... so having this helped out tons! This particular one is great for summer time when it is warm/hot out. The fabric is breathable so she stays cool. When we are inside in an AC room, I will over dress her with socks and such because it is SO breathable. But we wouldn't want it any other way! It is perfect!!!",5,1
MiaModa Facile Stroller - Carbon,"I Love this Stroller! I have been on an unending quest for the perfect stroller, and this is the closest I have gotten. I have one child, and have been through 12 strollers. This folds compactly, is easy to steer with one hand, and I don't kick the wheels when walking (I am only 5'5)  It has an adjustable leg support (that only works in 2 positions, down and up) and a reclining seat (woo hoo), and as a bonus it has a roomy storage basket underneath. My little girl (2 y.o. 26 lbs) has plenty of room and is comfortable in it. All of this and it is an umbrella stroller!! It is as close to perfect as I could find...without spending more than $100 of course.I had the Jeep Wrangler All Terrain Umbrella, The Cosco Sprint, various generic umbrella strollers, 2 Cosco Lightweight Deluxe Comfort Strollers(the next best stroller but it doesn't handle weight well),  Graco Metro Lite, Baby Trend Jogger, Graco Full Size...just to name a few. This stroller has beaten all of them hands down. Highly Recommended.",5,1
"Russ Berrie Small Blessings My 1st Rosary Box, Pink",My sister gave my son this rosary as a Baptism gift and it is beautiful! Perfect for a baby boy. I highly recommend it.,5,1
"Adiri BPA Free Natural Nurser Ultimate Bottle Stage 2 Blue, Med Flow (3-6 months)","This is perfect for babies that don't take the bottle. I BF exclusively my baby until 6 months and when I tried to introduce the bottle she was just biting the nipples. I tried with too many different bottles and nipples that I was frustrated... until I found this one!!! She drank from it since the very first time I gave it to her! In addition, it does not leak if you are very careful assembling it each time.  Note: If you use a bottle warmer to warm the milk it takes a little longer time if you use this bottle than a regular bottle. Not a problem, I just add more water to the warmer than suggested. Hope this helps ;)",5,1
"North American Bear Company Sleepyhead Bunny Natural, Tan Stripe, Medium","I got the tan Sleepyhead Bunny and the light blue one for my grandkids, who are nearly one and two years old. I think they are perfect for this age; no removable parts to choke on or get lost. They are machine washable on cold inside a pillow case. The bunnies are so cute in their stripey pajamas, and the velour material that makes up the rest of the bunnies (the feet, hands and head) is super soft and cuddly. Wonderful baby gift; can't wait to see how they like them!",5,1
"American Baby Company Organic Reversible Blanket, Mocha","I love this blanket so much I have bought two of them. Organic, soft and beautiful are my favorite things, this blanket is perfect.",5,1
"American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Crib &amp; Toddler Size Flat Mattress Pad Cover, White","I measured my crib mattress to make sure this was the correct size. It says 28"" by 52"" in the description, which was the exact size of my mattress, but is about an inch smaller on all sides. Being stunted in size, I was pleased to find that it didn't slide around or bunch. I've washed and dried it several times and it has held up very well. Some reviews said only air dry so the back doesn't tear. I've done both air drying and in the dryer, and it has come out just fine either way. I use this as the only pad cover and it does the job well enough. I liked the suggestions of using this as a layering between sheets so you can just pull it off and have a fresh layer in the middle of the night when both you and baby don't want to have to go to all the work of taking apart the whole bed just to put new sheets down! The padding is soft and a good amount of plush. I was worried about it being too small, but it has worked perfectly for such an excellent price.",4,1
"American Baby Company Organic Cotton Interlock Crib Sheet, Natural","The color is such a nice sage but really, these sheets are SO SOFT!  They fit the crib mattress perfectly but I cannot get over how soft they feel.  Love it!",5,1
Yookidoo Discovery Playhouse,This toy is perfect for my 1 year old. She really enjoys the balls going around and the ball lock up with the shape keys. It is really great. I think it is perfect for kids this age up to about three. It stores easily so you aren't stuck with a giant thing that you have to completely take apart in order to put away.,5,1
"Kids Line My First ABC Fitted Sheet, Multicolor","I purchased the 'My First ABCs' nursery set, which included only one ABC fitted sheet.  The sheet was the same beige color, but had small ABCs on it.  I thought I should order some back-ups (for life's little messes).  I saw this sheet and loved the design.  It compliments the set, but gets away from the ABCs a little.  It seems like the room was being taken over a little bit, so this adds a nice contrast.  The colors match perfectly.I also thought that this sheet may allow for circles to be painted on the wall, WITH letters.  The design ideas are endless!I recommend this sheet and this seller very highly.",5,1
Baby Jogger Adjustable Belly Bar,"Even though this says it is for the 2008 city and summit, I purchased it with my 2011 city mini and it fits perfectly. Pricey but necessary with the stroller if you ever want to add snack trays or have your baby sit up and hold on.",4,1
Animals Wooden Ceiling Mobile,"This mobile is exactly what we were looking for.  It is a simple design, but the animals are colorful and it does the job of giving our daughter something to focus on when she is falling asleep.  Plus, as she gets older, we can learn animals and colors with it.  Set it up with an orbiter motor and it works perfectly.",5,1
Animals Wooden Ceiling Mobile,"This is such a cute mobile.  I wanted to get a mobile for my son's room, but we didn't want anything loud or flashy.  He loves it! I unboxed it and unfurled all the animals. I held it above him and he smiled and squealed :D.  It spins nicely and catches his attention.  I think this will help him on focusing his eyes too.  The colors are great and would be perfect for a little boy or girl.  I like that I didn't have to put anything together like some other mobiles I looked at.  Seems well put together.  I would recommend buying one of those arms to attach it to.  We hung it from the ceiling, but I probably would have preferred to have the arm to hang it from.",5,1
Safety 1st Sleepy Baby Nail Clipper,"These clippers work well.  The light is handy; my son loves it and wants to eat it all the time.  There are times the cut doesn't seem sharp enough, and we have knicked him once each (mom and dad) so it's obviously not perfect, but overall it gets the job done and we can't complain.",4,1
EZ-Freeze Cereal on the Go (Colors May Vary),"I am a college student and need to pack lunch two days a week.  I pack my lunch at 8am, and the milk is still ice cold at 1pm when I eat lunch-- in fact, last week I missed lunch and my milk was still cold when I got home at 4pm.  I only wish that the cereal had a screw top, and that there was plastic in between the cereal bowl and where you screw the milk compartment on-- when you unscrew the milk, if your unit tipped over at all in transit there is milk on the bottom of the bowl which can make a mess if you let it drip or put it down directly on the table.  Bring a napkin to wipe the bottom as soon as you unscrew at lunchtime and this unit will be perfect.",4,1
Baby Nasal Aspirator Vacuum Suction Pigeon (Made in Japan),Perfect nasal vacuum for infants since you control the amount of suction force applied and not some motor.  We tried the typical bulb syringe but they couldnt fit in my 2 month olds' nasal cavity and could not remove anything.  The aspirator can remove liquid/solid mucuos.  Its a 2 handed operation so you'll need someone to old the babys' head.  All my friends and family have the aspirator for their children.,5,1
Dundee Burp Cloths/Diapers - White,"These function purely as nice, soft and absorbent burp cloths. They wash up very nicely and get really soft. They aren't fancy or pretty like the ones you find in specialty baby stores, but I'd rather pay for function over style.  I would never use them as diapers as directed on the packaging, you want DSQ (diaper service quality) prefolds for that purpose. But they'll be great for absorbing baby spit up. They're also the perfect size for draping over your shoulder, IMO. The thicker middle part is placed perfectly for baby to spit up on when draped over your shoulder.",5,1
Dundee Burp Cloths/Diapers - White,These are perfect Burp Cloths great quality and easy to wash perfect I would recommend worth every penny very thick,5,1
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"We use this all of the time. We have used it as a stand alone potty many times and it works perfectly. As other reviewers have stated, be sure to securely  lock the legs, or the seat will collapse. We also use it at the grandparents' house regularly, as they do not have a toddler potty. We simply put it on top of the regular toilet seat. I have only had this product for a few weeks and cannot count how many times we have needed and successfully used this potty. Without it, I sincerely believe our potty training progress would have slowed down tremendously because of my daughter's fears of the BIG potty. I highly recommend this product.",5,1
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,A friend recommended this as the MUST HAVE potty for the car and she was right! I've only it a couple times so far and it's been super convenient. I would highly recommend and my little guy (22 months) fits on it perfectly!,5,1
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"I bought the Potette Plus (green seat with blue legs) at my local Babies R Us about 6 months ago.  At first, I didn't think it was that great.  My main complaint being the seat ring was far too big for a little hiney and my daughter's hiney kept falling INTO it.  Another reviewer made the comparison to it being like the rim of a toilet without the seat - fairly accurate description.  I just measured the hole and it's 6 inches wide by 7 inches long.  Compare that to the Fisher Price On the Go Potty (love that too) which has a hole measuring 4 1/2 inches wide by 6 inches long and it makes a huge difference.  I still believe the hole is much too big, especially since the potty is so low to the ground (only 4 inches tall in it's snapped together standing position!), making it a little hard for younger toddlers to position themselves correctly on it.  I am not sure how the kids in the product pictures are sitting on it with their legs out in front of them - my daughter has to straddle it.  I really believe the ring/seat of this potty could have been made a little smaller (even an inch all around would make a difference), and then it would be absolutely perfect and even easier to tote around.  So those are the only two negatives I have found with this seat.On to the good stuff.  It's small and when folded, can easily fit into a large purse or backpack, and it's lightweight enough to hang it (in a bag of some sort) over a stroller handle.  I used to keep the Fisher Price On the Go potty in my van, but now I only have this one in the van since it's so much smaller, lighter, and I can grab it and put it into a large purse for excursions.My daughter doesn't like to sit on the plastic bag that's supposed to go over the seat, so we had to figure out a way to make that work until she gets used to sitting on the plastic bag.  We cut down a 1 gallon ice cream pail so it would fit under the potty and we use the bags in the bucket, then put the potette over that.  Works great.  For now, I just keep the potty in it's standing position in the van and since it's small enough, it's no big deal.  I found that it fits in a drawstring backpack in it's standing position (even with the cut down bucket, lol), so we don't use the plastic carry bag it came with.  4 gallon trash bags work very well too.I've never used it as a toilet reducer, but I did just place it on both of my different toilet seats at home (one is molded wood, the other is plastic and picky when it comes to toilet reducers).  This seat clicks into flat position and is very sturdy.  There are little grippies on the inside of the legs to help it grab the toilet seat a little and it does help slightly.  Sturdy when on both toilet seats - even when pushed on by me.  On the molded wood seat, the potette fit very nicely, almost center on the toilet seat.  On the plastic seat, I had to push the potette back a little further for it to fit the best.  It would still wiggle a bit with a wiggly toddler.  I didn't buy it for this purpose though so I don't anticipate using it in this position, though it is nice to have the option.",4,1
"Carters Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover, Chocolate",The green color is very pretty. Sort of a silvery green. Gender neutral.  The material is soft and silky.  I Love it!! Have washed it 3-4 times with no issues at all. Fits both of my changing pads (standard ones) perfectly.  If it were a bit less expensive I'd buy 5 of them in all different colors!,5,1
"Carters Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover, Chocolate",This is the perfect changing pad cover. It washes well and is super soft for my babies skin. The cover does not fit too tight so it is easy to take off and put back on my changing pad. Plus the brown color matches my son's room perfectly. Would change nothing about this product.,5,1
"Carters Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover, Chocolate","I love this changing table cover, it is so soft and comfortable. It has been washed numerous times already and still looks great. It stretches perfectly to fit over the pad and stays snug enough to not move excessively. The color is great too since it doesn't show stains like light colors.",5,1
"Carters Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover, Chocolate",ordered this Wednesday night at received it Friday morning. great product for the price and very soft! we love it and matches with green bumper perfectly!,5,1
"Carters Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover, Chocolate","These are very soft and durable and fit my contoured changing pad perfectly (I thought all covers would, but that's not true - I bought another one from a big name store that did not work at all!). Unfortunately, I haven't used mine a great deal - my little one likes to mess all over the changing pad the minute we take her diaper off and I got tired of washing the covers all the time! Lol! But when she gets a little bigger and a little more predictable, they will definitely go back on...",5,1
Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub in Blue,I've had this tub in use for about a month now and it's working great. Didn't take very long to inflate and my son just loves it. It fits perfectly and holds just the right amount of water (so I don't have to fill our entire adult tub!) for my son's bath. I highly recommend this product if your baby is outgrowing their infant tub and not quite ready for the whole big bathtub experience.,5,1
Baby Aspen Pig-n-A Blanket 2-Piece Gift Set,This is so adorable. All of it is made of the softest material. All around the edge of the blanket is the &#34;This little piggy went to market ... saying. It is a perfect baby shower gift.,5,1
Baby Aspen Five Little Monkeys Gift Set with Keepsake Basket,"I already purchased the Monkey Boy-2 tier diaper cake, so keeping with the theme of monkeys, this gift basket will be perfect sitting on the dresser in the baby's room.",5,1
Naturepedic MPS2438 Organic Cotton Portacrib Mattress,"We bought a full size Naturepedic organic mattress for our toddler's crib when he was born almost 2 years ago, and it's been the best purchase.  So when shopping for a mattress for the mini-crib his sister will be sleeping in, I knew I wanted another Naturepedic.  So many other organic mattresses are more expensive because they are made with wool and latex - 2 things I happen to be allergic to.  I liked that this one is made from something I feel is safe for my baby to sleep on, and I feel the price is fair after actually seeing how well it works in our crib.This portacrib pad/mattress fits the DaVinci/Baby Mod mini cribs perfectly.  Our  mini crib came with a mattress that was horrible (although the cribs are great), it had gaps between the side and the mattress, and the mattress itself was flimsy and covered in vinyl.  This Naturepedic mattress fits great, with a nice tight fit, and it's firm enough for a newborn.  It's much sturdier and even half an inch thicker than the mattress provided by our crib manufacturer.  I know some reviewers were worried that it's only 2 inches thick, and it's labeled as a ""pad"", but it is a mattress, and very high quality.I highly recommend this mattress, and in case you're wondering, we've found that the Carter's Portacrib Sheets fit it perfectly.",5,1
"Tadpoles Multi-Layer Tulle Curtain Panel, White",These curtains are beautiful! I bought them for my 2 year old's new princess room and they are just magical. They are soft and drape perfectly. There is gathering in the layers so one panel was plenty for her window. I would definatley recomend this product.,5,1
"Summer Infant Swaddleme Cotton Knit, Butterflies","I used the Halo Sleep Sack for the first 2 months, but I was looking for something that was more light weight. Since I have a tall, skinny baby, the Sleep Sack wings end up wrapping around almost past where the velcro ends. After using it a few times, it was even worse because the Sleep Sack stretched out. She would also routinely break out of the swaddle.The Swaddleme is perfect. It is very light weight, which is great for the summer, and she almost never breaks out of the swaddle. It's also really easy and fast to swaddle her. I've even managed to do it in the dark after a night feeding! It is really easy to secure the velcro when you wash it so that it doesn't stick to other clothes.",5,1
Clay Hanging Keepsake Kit (Makes 2 Plaques),"This is relatively easy to use and the result is nice. They send you everything you need for the project. I made an impression of my baby's hand and his foot quickly and relatively easily (it took two tries, but the clay didn't harden up as I rolled it out for the second attempt). They weren't perfect, but I wasn't about to torture him to get it exactly right. The impression is shallow, not deep, and looks pretty much exactly as it's pictured.",4,1
JJ Cole Toddler Bundle Me Lite in Khaki,"I had an infant sized bundle me lite and original.. i wish i had just gotten the toddler size in the 1st place! It fits on my infant carseat exactly the same as my infant ones..except it hangs of the end of my carseat a little bit! the infant ones seemed to not be roomy enough for my son when he was 6 months so i got rid of them. I wouldnt reccomend a bundle me in any size for a newborn unless you have a 3 point harness system..i have a 5 point (see the images i added above) and when my son was newborn the harness rested on the side of his shoulders, not by his neck, so if i had gotten in a wreck he would have ejected from his carseat..yikes!! but now he is bigger so the straps are in the correct place, i wish jj cole would just put the slots for the harness closer together. that is why i gave it one star short of perfect, but this broduct is awesome! perfect for the stroller, carseat, swing, bouncy seat, or anything!!! my huge 2 year old fits in the toddler sized bundle me great!!! im going to buy another one so they can each have one! also i thought i would add that this bundle me is the exact same thing as the embroidered one for $10more on this site!! i thought i was getting a plain one but it came embroidered! awesome!",4,1
Potty Training Urinal for Boys,"We were desperate to help our twin three-year old boys transition to underwear, but they refused to urinate on the traditional ""seated"" potties due to many ""misses,"" during which their socks got wet.  This urinal is AMAZING!  After using it for a week, my boys now wear underwear!  They love to use it, and we've never had a single drip on the floor!  The potty is a neutral color (white) to match all bathroom decor (unlike its competitor's product.)  The design is simple, and cleaning is very easy.  The height is perfect (we use it on the stand.)  I am ordering another for travel - this urinal has been THE reason for success of potty training in our house.  Can't recommend it enough!",5,1
NoJo Jungle Tales 3 Piece Wall Hanging Set,"We purchased this item because we have the matching bedding and are very happy with it!  It is the perfect addition for our nursery.  I agree with the first reviewer, I also thought they were wood or some other material and was surprised to see that they were soft and plush.  I don't see anything negative because of that but it was just a surprise.  Highly recommend!",5,1
NoJo Jungle Tales Lamp and Shade,"I bought this to add the final touch to my grandsons' nursery.  We had all the other NoJo Jungle Tales items, and thought this would be a perfect match.  It is not the same colors as are in the valance and wallhanging, but close enough in the overall spirit.  It's a pretty well made lamp and should last a long time.",4,1
Munchkin High Speed Bottle and Food Warmer with Pacifier Cleaning Basket,we have two of these now and a travel one. this is perfect for the new baby in anyones home.,5,1
Sweet Jojo Designs Musical Baby Crib Mobile - Pink and Khaki Camo Army Camouflage,My daughter decorated her nursery in &#34;Browning&#34; pink and camo.  She needed a pink camo mobile and this is the only thing I could find that came close to her colors and pattern.  It is a perfect match and finishes off the crib.  It is easily put together (my 13 year old son put it together) and mounts easily to the crib.  The music sound is good and works well.,5,1
Evenflo Aura Select Travel System - Caroline,loved this combo. my son fit perfect in it and it was very easy to push with the seat connected.,5,1
"Dr. Brown's 3 Pack BPA Free Polypropylene Bottle, 8 oz","I still love these bottles. My son is now 10 months old and has been using these bottles since he was 3 weeks old. The absolute best thing about these bottles is that my son has been interchanging between breast and bottle since he was 3 weeks old and he has had no issue going from one to the other. I've heard about nipple confusion but never experienced it and I think these bottles have a lot to do with it.  He drinks pumped milk from these bottles during the day when I'm at work and nurses in the mornings and nights when I'm home. The first time I gave him a bottle, I used the bottles that came with my Medela Freestyle Breast Pump - the nipples collapsed as soon as he started sucking on them. I switched to the Dr. Browns bottles immediately and my son went to town. I have used these bottles since. Yes, some of the blue decoration on the outside of the bottles has faded over time but that is not a big deal to me. I replace the nipples every 2 months or so but have been using the same bottles and parts for 10 months. I clean them in warm soapy water after every use and sterilize them in a microwave sterilizer once a week. They have held up great. No warping, no discoloration. I initially used the Philips AVENT BPA-Free Bottle Brush but I was replacing it every 2 months because the bristles kept flattening. I switched to the Munchkin Deluxe Bottle Brush about 3 months ago and haven't had to replace it - bristles still intact and it has a better nipple brush. Lastly, I use the Dr Browns microwave sterilizer, Dr Browns bottle warmer and the Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack which all work perfectly for the Dr. Browns bottle system. I recommend the Dr Brown's BPA Free Deluxe Gift Set because it has six 8 oz. bottles, four 4 oz. bottles, 10 Level 1 nipples, 4 Level 2 nipples, 4 Level 3 nipples, 4 Level 4 nipples, 6 storage caps and 5 cleaning brushes. It is available at BRU and I will be getting that for the next baby since I plan on buying a new set for him/her. Oh and for pumping mothers, I was able to pump directly into the 4 oz Dr Browns bottles while using my Medela Freestyle Breast Pump! They screw right into the pump parts. Lastly, my son never had gas issues and again, I attribtute that to these wonderful bottles.This is my first 5-star review ever - that says something.",5,1
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 6 Pack Soft Bite Infant Spoon, Colors May Vary","I used these with my first child almost 6 years ago, and I just got new ones.  These are fantastic spoons and perfect for any stage food.  Despite what other reviews say, they are not too shallow.  You are not supposed to give them giant mouthfuls anyway!  With my first I tried every other spoon out there, and these were her favorite.  All the others are too hard...these have a nice soft end, which is perfect for those sensitive little gums.  My oldest also liked to chew on these, with supervision of course.  Take it from an experienced mom, these are great and go really well with the gerber bowls with lids!",5,1
Elegant Baby Plush Microfiber Blankie - Pastel Blue,"I'm really happy with this security blanket.  I've looked at tons at local baby stores to high end specialty shops, and this is high quality satin and microfiber, for a very reasonable price.  The blanket specifications clearly state how large the blanket is, so some of the other bad reviews didn't make sense to me.  Read the dimensions, this is NOT a full sized blanket, but is the perfect security blanket for baby girl.  It washes well, and seems to be holding up ok.  Might even buy 1-2 more just to have for her.",5,1
Edushape Giant Blocks 16 Pcs,"These blocks are terrific for little ones - since they are foam there is no danger of injury when the blocks fall and there is also no noise which makes them perfect for apartment living. My two year old loves the size and is thrilled to make very tall towers. I was unsure about which ""jumbo"" foam blocks to purchase but speaking now from experience, I highly recommend these. The thinner (less expensive) versions would be much harder to balance and the smaller ones wouldn't have the same impact. I also was torn between 16 and 32 quantity packs but at this stage/age, 16 is just right. It is surprising how much large foam blocks cost but after searching the internet, I was hard-pressed to find a less expensive source!",5,1
"Bummis Swimmi Cloth Diapers, Turtles, Small (9-15 lbs)","We have tried multiple swim diapers and this one is (by far) the best. It holds poop in, in case of an accident and the fit is always perfect because its adjustable like a diaper. I wish we would have saved the trouble and money on all the other swim diapers we tried and bought this one first!",5,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub,It fit perfectly over our kitchen sink. I have been using it since my girl was born. She is 11 months now and just starting to outgrow.,5,1
"High Back Full Bucket Toddler Infant Swing Seat - Seat Only, Yellow with SSS logo Sticker","Perfect choice for my little granddaughter and grandson. They want to swing and feel safe in this product because of the way it is designed. I have had other swings that are too open, and they don't want to use them. In this one, they feel very secure and can enjoy themselves.",5,1
"High Back Full Bucket Toddler Infant Swing Seat - Seat Only, Yellow with SSS logo Sticker",Bought 2. My twin granddaughters are 9 months.  They love the swings...put them up in backyard so we didn't have to have outings so much to the park.  These are just like park infant swings...and a perfect place for them to be when we're outside this summer.  Highly recommend!!!!!,5,1
"GRACO Backless TurboBooster Car Seat, Groovy","Very well made and sturdy.  Boosts my little one perfectly and it's very very easy to put her in it.  I was looking for something to replace the ""big"" seat she had and this one looked good, especially with the ability to choose a design.  The only drawback is that I had to add extra padding because it wasn't as comfortable as her ""big"" seat.  Now, with the extra pad, it's absolutely perfect!",4,1
"Graco Meal Time Highchair, Roman","This high chair has been great! We received it a few weeks ago and it's been perfect for our 1 year old. The tray is easy to remove and clean, the chair cover is easy to wipe down, and it's stable enough that I can leave my baby in it to finish up things in the kitchen while she sits and eats without worrying she'll tip over in it.Great value for a great chair! And the print makes it perfect for a girl or a boy!",4,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Apple, Infant","We took our 7 month old grandson to the Smokey Mountains and the Bundleme was perfect for riding him around in his stroller in the cold weather.  Very easy to zip him in and out of it, or even remove him from his stroller still bundled in his Bundleme.  It kept him toasty warm and many were questioning where we bought it.  Love it, and would recommend others to purchase one.",5,1
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Apple, Infant","Amazon was BY FAR the best price of this item at the time of purchase. The item arrived on time and in perfect condition. Be advised, this Bundleme is toasty!! Living in Colorado (with fairly mild winters, for a snow state) I had to unzip one side pretty often to keep baby from overheating. This was especially true in the car. A great buy! A great price! Thanks, Amazon.",5,1
"Ju-Ju-Be Be Tween Diaper Bag, Black/Silver","I love this diaper bag. Had been looking for one that is big enough to carry everything in it but not so big that it is impossible to carry - this bag is the perfect inbetween size.I love the color and the pattern, it wipes down really easily inside and out and I love that it has lots of different pockets for you to organize your stuff into, including one that is perfect for you wallet and phone.I would recommend that you also buy the JuJu Be stroller clips with this item as it is great to be able to attach it to the stroller whilst you are out and about!",5,1
"phil&amp;teds Lobster Highchair, Red","Love it, these things are perfect for a toddler, and our baby fits in there well now too.  Perfect for resteraunts.",5,1
"Balboa Baby Dr. Sears Adjustable Sling, Blue Plaid",Frees the hands to allow for shopping or holding on to another child.  Keeps baby cozy and comfortable. It is a perfect gift for a new mother or for the mother of many who needs to keep her hands free.,5,1
Inspired Ideas BABY CozyWedge Crib Bumper in Blue,"I love this bumper - it is a perfect design!  I bought it on sale (only one color was discounted about $20) so it was well worth it.  I'm not sure I would purchase it at full price just because it is quite a bit of money.  If you aren't discouraged by the price, I highly recommend it.",4,1
The First Years Star Teething Blanket,"We had gotten this toy as a gift four years ago for our older daughter and was recycled for our second daughter.  She loved it.  And then we lost it and needed to find it again.  Through an extensive search online (since we didn't know the name or manufacturer) we finally found it!  It is the perfect toy for an infant.  It's squishy, so it is easy to hold onto.  One of the star ends has a squeaky part, for fun noises.  It crunches, it's silky and the blue star end is rubbery for teething.  It has everything you can ask for and is machine washable.  What a wonderful toy!",5,1
The First Years American Red Cross Comfort Care Comb And Brush,"Our baby was born with a lot of hair. Combine that with the fact that babies spend most of their time lying down, and you've got a recipe for major bedhead!Most baby brushes are adequate - they usually have thin nylon bristles that are reasonably soft enough for use by infants. But I've had trouble finding a decent comb, which I really need to work on the serious tangles and knots that our baby gets. Surprisingly, most of the combs that are included in sets for babies that I've tried have sharp teeth. Even the ones with rounded teeth feel very stiff. They just don't feel safe.So I gave this set a try, and it is perfect! The comb teeth are rounded and flexible, so it should be gentle enough for even the youngest infants.And the brush is very soft as well. I like the shape of it, which gives you a good grip - it's designed so that you can hold the back of the brush firmly, not just by the handle.All in all, this is a perfect set that does exactly what I need it to do. I'm very happy I found it.My only wish is that it would be great if they sold the comb separately. I'd love to have extras on hand but not buy the whole set again.",5,1
"Baby Starters Textured Dot Blanket with Satin Trim, White",My son had this same blanky in blue as his ""baby blanky"". He is 5 1/2 now and it is still in perfect condition. I just got this one in the mail and it is just so perfect and soft and I know it will last :) GREAT FEELING!!!,5,1
"Mini Orchestra, Set of 4",They are the perfect size for little hands to hold on to. Each one makes a different sound so he didn't get tired of playing with them.,5,1
"Baby Teether Ball, Assorted Colors","This is by far the best teething toy we've found for my nearly seven-month-old daughter. She never really was a fan of the teethers that go in the refridgerator, most are too big to reach the gums and cumbersome to hold. She's starting to like Sophie the giraffe now that she's older, but even still I feel like she likes this 4 to 5 dollar toy a little more than that super expensive one. When she was younger (around 3 and 4 months old) she already was teething but wasn't the best at holding things yet. She used to lie on her stomach supporting herself with her arms and chew on this. It kind of reminded me of a puppy chewing on a dog toy and it honestly kind of looks like a dog toy, but it helped to alleaviate her teething pain better than anything else. The teether is basically a soft plastic ball with nubby things about the diameter of my thumb sticking out all over it. It's great for babies to chew on because it's the same on all sides so basically anyway they hold it is the right way. The nubbies are long enough to reach hard to get parts of the gums and yet short enough that they won't cause your baby to gag on them. Now that my daughter is older she holds it by one nubby and shoves another into her mouth.  It's the perfect size for little hands to hold. The squeak is actually very quiet, not nearly as loud or high-pitched as the squeak that Sophie makes. You really need to squeeze it to make it squeak anyway so it doesn't squeak the entire time the baby is playing with it, but you as a parent can squeak it to get the baby's attention. The scentis wonderful, my daughter really seems to enjoy it and my fiance and I cant agree on whether it smells like vanilla or strawberries but either way it's got a very yummy smell. Cleaning it is easy because it's all one piece and doesn't have any little crevaces for bacteria to grow. I wouldn't submerge it in water but that really isn't necessary. Overall it's a wonderful teether and I only wish I could have gotten a different color!",5,1
"Lifefactory Glass Baby Bottle with Silicone Sleeve, Raspberry, 9 Ounce",I love how it's made of glass and of perfect size for little baby hands. I also like how their sippy caps work with these little bottles so you can keep using these bottles even your babies are turning into toddlers.,5,1
"aden + anais Muslin Dream Blanket, For The Birds - Owl",I bought this for a summer blanket for traveling with my 3 year old. It is large enough to cover her comfortably which was hard to find because most &#34;baby&#34; blankets were too small for her but a bigger blanket was too big for traveling. This is the perfect size. The cotton is very breathable so my daughter was not too hot in the summer. I was worried about this because the blanket is rather thick but she loves it and does not seem hot at all. It is very soft and does get softer with multiple washings. I docked it one star because I think the price is outrageous but this brand is expensive so I guess you are paying for the label.,4,1
Boppy Bouncer in Pink,We bought this for our new granddaughter.  My daughter says it's the perfect shape for cuddling & swaddling.  The vibration and music are indeed helpful.,5,1
"Elegant Baby Microfiber Blanket, Pink","I got the blue one for my son who is 7 months and the hot pink for my 2 year old daughter.. These blankets are so soft, the satin trim is a great touch and the size is perfect! I am thinking of getting two more to keep in the car all the time and to have as a backup, as I foresee having these blankets in our family for quite a long time!",5,1
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot","It attaches perfectly to clothes -- easy to remove when you intend to, but doesnt fall off spontaneously. And the part that attaches to the pacifier is cleverly design to fit absolutely any pacifier. I washed it with laundry and it was OK.",5,1
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot","My baby is a pacifier addict, and we have to take one with us where ever we go. I got so tired of having to wash pacifiers that were dropped on the ground, so I was THRILLED when I found this wonderful contraption... it's perfect! We use the Soothie pacifiers, and most other pacifier clips aren't suitable for the Soothies. But this one is! It works with any kind of pacifier, it is easy to wash, and it comes in all kinds of cute patterns and colors. We have 3 so far. I am sure we will buy more!",5,1
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot",This paci grip is perfect for holding a soothie binky. Totally cute design and the clip stays in place really well.,5,1
European Upright Baby Bath Tub - Spa Baby Color: Pure,"The tub is really great - and our daughter loves bath time. She relaxes completely when we put her in and the tub is very easy to use. We've been using the tub since she was four weeks old and it's terrific. It also fits perfectly in our kitchen sink and bath time is very easy - and no leaning over into the bath tub which is very hard on the back.I'm updating this review at 4.5 months to say that she's outgrown the tub (26.5 inches and 15.5 lbs). We're going to transition to a reclining tub now that she's bigger, but this tub for the newborn and early infancy was fabulous.",5,1
"C.R. Gibson Bound Keepsake Memory Book of Baby's First 5 Years, Lulu","I decided to use this book for my daughter because it is very neutral.  The book has lots of pages for specific events (first bath, first tooth), but there are lots of pages in the back to add your own pictures or notes.  For me, it works perfectly.",5,1
"C.R. Gibson Bound Keepsake Memory Book of Baby's First 5 Years, Lulu",Love IT WAS PERFECT . been looking for just the right memory book for my granddaughter and this was it .. Thank you,5,1
"Gift Mark Childrens Two Step Stool with Storage, White","I bought this for my daughter while she was potty training... It's the perfect potty height and we just scoot it to the sink and it's still perfect. We started using the stool when she was 22 mos, so it's a pretty good height.",5,1
"Gift Mark Childrens Two Step Stool with Storage, White","The good: This step stool is perfect for our 2-year old to use in front of the bathroom sink. It is sturdy, doesn't wobble and is a great weight.  The storage compartment is perfect for holding a couple extra rolls of TP!I would have given 5 stars except, for the poor: Packaging was missing the hinge for the storage compartment *However, the Amazon customer service rep was exceptionally nice and sent a replacement.* The instructions are very poor for installing the hinge, which once installed, does not allow the lid to close. (So we removed the hinge altogether; it really isn't necessary) The holes drilled for a small part of the stool that goes under the bottom step do not line up with the end pieces. However, another part that isn't really needed!",4,1
"Edushape 7&quot; See Me Sensory Ball, Colors May Vary",My daughter plays with these a lot while in daycare.  So we bought them for her to play at home.  We bought both the small and large size balls.  The balls are a soft flexible plastic material.  The spikes are perfect for teething and the texture helps her grab and hold on to the ball.  They're easy to push and she smacks them around and crawls behind it to do it all over again.  I gave it a 4 because the material is really soft and they deflate quicker than expected.,4,1
Little Boys Make Noise Rug,The rug was for my grandson and fit just perfectly beside his crib. He is just learning to crawl and loves the bright colors. The rug arrived on time and without defects.,5,1
"Britax Boulevard 65 TSIP Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","My son easily converts from britax chaperone to britax boulevard. he was only 5 months when he begins to not fit on the chaperone so i did lots of research and read lots of review when i finally bought the boulevard and i was so happy with it. My son is very comfortable sitting on it, i have a small SUV but it still fits good even if we have to move the seat since my husband has long legs. I purchased another 1 for my husbands car which is a van and it was perfect for it. The belt wont twist unlike the other car seats that i have tested before. easy to place on the car and 5 point harness makes a big difference. I would recommend this product to anybody who asked me on whats the best carseat. It is pricey but worth it.",5,1
Lil Rinser Splashguard in Purple,"My 2 your old son does fine with bath time, but hates to have his hair washed.  I bought this hoping that it would help...first time using it, he still freaked out.  Second time, I held it on while dad did the rinsing.  BIG difference!  Once he realized that it would keep the water out of his eyes, he was fine with it!  Last night, he actually asked me to wash his hair!  It doesn't have a ""perfect"" seal, but it does the trick for us and has made hair washing MUCH easier.",5,1
Rich Frog Squeak Easy Bunny,"this is my 6 month old daughter's fav toy, and has been since the beginning. It's nice that it's soft to when she inevitably bonks herself in the head... It's fine. It's one of the only toys that it light and skinny enough that she can actually hold herself! Perfectly thought out toy for littles. and the little squeak and crinkle sounds it makes are adorable and light up my babies face.. and her 2 year old brother!",5,1
"Kids Line My First ABC Basket With Liner, Multicolor","I bought three of these baskets to go in the nursery.  I have the entire bedding set that this coordinates with, and it fit perfectly on a little cart with shelves we were using in the room.  The basket itself is not rough wicker, so there's no chance of it snagging anything you put in there.  It's the perfect size to hold cloth diapers, all the gazillion tiny socks for my baby, bibs and hats, etc... all those little things that would get lost in a drawer.  I may buy a couple more.",5,1
Kiddie Kangaroo Travel Storage Accessory Stroller in Black,"My Jeep Wrangler Umbrella stroller came with these built in. I loved them so much that when I upgraded to a quality (ahem...) stroller I bought these. Perfect for storing sippy cups and miscellaneous toys that she ""couldn't live without"" during a shopping trip. Doesn't add any excess size to your stroller too. These don't stick out, and they fold up with the stroller, no problems at all. Definitely would recommend to a friend or family!",4,1
"Joovy Kooper Umbrella Stroller, Yellow","We've had this stroller about 6 months now and overall this is a fantastic stroller.  I shopped around a LOT before buying this stroller and I wasn't disappointed.Pros:-The colors, we have the Appletree, are bright and fun. We get a lot of compliments.-The design.  We also get a lot of compliments on how cool it looks, not like others at all.-The handles are nicely padded and it's much easier to steer with one hand than with other strollers.-Under basket is HUGE.-My DS loves the recline, he can be straight up or laid almost all the way back for sleeping or diaper changes on the go.-The canopy is GIGANTIC!  It shades the sun well while still allowing my DS to see outside, it also covers the seat so well that when it rains he doesn't get wet.  The viewing window for parents is also very large.-Putting it together was a snap.  Literally just snap on the wheels and the canopy and you're ready to roll.-It's super easy to steer and also easy to breakdown.Cons:-The cup holders are really only large enough and stable enough to hold a small bottle of water.  If that's something you're looking for you can always buy an add-on though.-The breaks are really tough to engage and unengage. Definitely not for the flip flops.-I'm 5'2"" so the height is perfect for me.  My husband is just over 6' and has long legs.  His stride almost makes his feet hit the back of the stroller so if you're super tall it might be uncomfortable.-It's definitely not ""compact"" but it's definitely not full-size.  I still take my tiny umbrella stroller when we just run to the bank or something because it's still easier.-There's no front bar or tray with for the baby.  It's not a problem for us but you can always buy one to add on.-Definitely not for newborns or smaller babies.  The lowest strap level is pretty high so it's not something you can use right away.Overall, I absolutely love this stroller!",4,1
"Joovy Kooper Umbrella Stroller, Yellow","What can I say.. Im in love!! Perfect size, big enough to fit my baby confortable and compact enough to make it easy to go to the stores without bumping into racks and other strollers!! LOVE IT!!!",5,1
"Graco Backless TurboBooster Car Seat, Jeweled Princess",We recently purchased this to replace my son's toddler car seat that he'd outgrown.  The price was right and the seat is perfect for my son.  The cup holders are handy and the seat seems to be very comfortable for my son.  We plan to purchase another one for our other car.,5,1

"Sleepy Wrap Classic Wrap Baby Carrier, Dark Pink, 0-18 Months","I bought this after I found out that the sling carrier we initially registered for has been recalled for safety issues. After reading the reviews on this site and looking at different pictures submitted from the users, it seemed like a no brainer to me. I really didn't know what I was getting.. just assumed that it'd be the same as any other sling carriers I've seen.First of all, let me say that this carrier works great.  Let me caution you, though, that this is not exactly a sling carrier in a technical sense. It's basically a long strand of elastic cloth that you wrap around your body a certain way to create spaces for your baby to sit in. Like I said, it works pretty well for the most part.  But before you buy this, I'd like you to think about these facts.  You might think they're stupid but I wish I knew them before I purchased it.1. You can't just pick this up and put the baby in it like most sling carriers(at least the ones I've seen). For the most part, it's not that big of a deal to wrap this around your body and put the baby in but it does take some time and there are times I wish it wasn't as involved to set it up.2. It takes some practice to get the tightness just right. If you wrap it too tight, your baby will pretty much suffocate... probably not... but you get the idea. If it's too loose, then the baby slides down. It'll still hold the baby but your baby will be on your stomach depending on his/her size. It's a problem when you have a newborn like me.3. Inevitably, if you repeat the process of taking the baby in and out for whatever reason for a few hours, the carrier will get loose. At that point, you'll have to undo the carrier then rewrap it.So basically, it all came down to convenience for me and my wife. Its elastic cloth is very well made.  You can tell it's made with quality materials. When I put this on just right, I know our baby just loves it. Since it's entirely made of elastic material, it basically fits the baby perfectly and securely. However, we don't live in a perfect world where 3 week old infants patiently wait for you to pick him/her up. At least mine doesn't.  That's when this carrier becomes a problem for me.  Another thing I just remembered is that sometimes, it gets pretty hot wearing this w/ a baby in it.  I live in Atlanta and we keep the temperature at around 66-68 degrees in winter (it's been around 3-40 degrees outside recently).  It's not that big of a deal now but I'm not sure how it'll be in the middle of summer.I will continue to use this carrier. I do believe it's a great idea and it's a very well made product. However, I will probably buy another carrier;namely Amy Coe sling from babies r us. One of our friends has one and it took about 30 seconds to put our baby in there and it won't get as hot in summer time because it doesn't enclose my baby like the sleepywrap does.Maybe I should've done more research (I usually do), but this carrier wasn't exactly what I thought it was.  I figured I'd let you guys know what I found out so you can make an informed decision.  Hope it helps.",4,1

"Ju-Ju-Be Be Prepared Diaper Bag, Black/Silver","I will start out by saying that I am in love with my bag. I am a girl that loves to buy purses, and I am always looking for the perfect bag. Not anymore! I love everything about it! I decided on the Charcoal Roses print which I adore. The inside looks blue online, but in person is more of a teal. I have owned my BP for 3 months, and my bag still looks brand new. One of the bottom corners where it is white looks a little dirty, but it has not been washed so I bet it will come out.Pros:*Machine Washable*Spill proof. Easy to wipe off when I have spilled.*Tons of pockets for organization. I can direct my hubby where to find things, and he can actually find what I asked for*Light colored interior makes it easy to see what I've got inside.* Can fit up to 4 bottles, sippies, or water bottles.*Crumb drain. Love the idea.*Mommy pocket is amazing! I can put in sunglasses, wallet, and anything else I want there. No need for 2 bags. This puts my purse, and diaper bag together.*Changing pad is really comfy. I have changed my baby on concrete floors and my baby is still happy.*Easy to get into, or use one handed.*Straps are perfect for cross body or one shoulder. I can even slide the shorter straps into the bag.*Fits everything I need. I can underpack the bag, and it still works wonderfully.Cons:* Crumb drain in awkward spot. I don't put snacks with the changing pad. I don't know why, but crumbs do find their way their though.All in all I love this bag. I use it every day with just 1 baby. I am an over packet, but know I'll have more kids so I just want to be ready. I suggest watching videos on YouTube which helped me to choose to get this bag. I recommend this bag, and JuJu Be bags. I have never liked a bag so much.",5,1

Vulli Chan Pie Gnon Natural Rubber Teether - Blue Chan,Chan is fabulous!  As soon as we gave him to our 7 month old daughter she immediately was grinning from ear to ear and put those hard pink knobs right in her mouth to chew on.  She loves the squeaks that he makes from the squeaker and also from her chewing on the rubber.  She carries him in her car seat and falls asleep holding him.  Chan is probably about 6"" tall and perfect for her little hands.  Great teether and toy!,5,1
Vulli Chan Pie Gnon Natural Rubber Teether - Blue Chan,Vulli makes the best chewing toys for babies.  Sophie the Giraffe was our first and I had to have another great toy for my little one.  This sweet toy is so easy for little fingers to grasp and perfect for chomping on.  It is soft and so easy for my daughter to hold on to.  It's the first toy that I grab for her when she's ready to play.  I will say that I find the squeeker inside to be most annoying but she loves this toy so much that I'll try to block it out.  As a mom of 3 small children I feel I can honestly say that this is a must have for young babies!,5,1
Summer Infant Deluxe PiddlePad,This is perfect for those days when a baby has a leaking diaper! I bought one but should of bought two. It's very handy especially for bouncer seats and strollers! I defiantly recommend this product! Also has a great price:),5,1
"Bummis Bio-Soft Liner, Small","I started using these after my son started eating solid foods. I was getting tired of having to soak our cloth diapers before putting them in the wash and searched for something to help me out. We use bumgenius 4.0s and elementals and they fit perfectly inside. There are occasional leaks on the side of the diapers (still contained, but on the fabric instead of the liner) from bunching but it makes cloth diapering so much easier. No spraying or dunking for us! We have a septic system and haven't had any problems.",5,1
"Bummis Bio-Soft Liner, Small","I am cloth diapering my son and I bought these liners to help with poop.Large size is perfect for us, the small size was way too small and I had to use 2 of them to cover one prefold...",5,1
"Bummis Bio-Soft Liner, Small","Perfect size for softbums as they are the same width.I only use this occasionally if I need to put diaper-cream on my baby's bum, but otherwise they are unnecessary until they start eating solids. The diapers can just be thrown in the wash, poop and all!",5,1

Mommy's Helper Safe-er-Grip Foot Rest,"Our stand up shower isn't too small, but when you but a seat in it so you have a place to shave your leg, it makes it feel small.  This little rest was perfect and doesn't take up much room.  Just make sure your tile is big enough to hold the suction cup.  Also you can really put all your weight on it, it will pop off the wall.",4,1

Kushies Infant Sunglasses 100% Anti UV lens Block - Colors may Vary,"My daughter is 14 months but tiny and with a small head for her age as well. I thought I had ordered the toddler ones but these came and I was a bit worried they would be too small for her. They say infant sunglasses but the packaging says &#34;newborn&#34; sunglasses. If your child is of normal/average size then these will probably fit until they are 9-12 months old but not longer. They fit my daughter perfectly right now and they are adorable and do have a little bit of give to the sides which is nice. The random color thing didn't bother me at all (we got pink which seems to be common?) since I have a girl, although I don't think it would have deterred me from ordering if I had a boy. I like the sunglasses and plan on ordering the toddler sized ones when she outgrows these.",4,1

Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"My husband has Multiple Sclerosis.  His legs don't always work, especially if he gets overheated.  I get up hours before he does in the morning.  Sometimes he would end up laying on the floor in the bathroom for 20 minutes because I could not hear him while I was in other parts of the house.  This baby monitor is perfect.  It is very powerful.  Not only can I hear when he gets up or takes a shower, but I can answer him when he talks to me.  I can wear the parent monitor and go about doing anything I need to do, including in the garage and the garden.  This little GEM has helped to improve both our lives.  We love it and definitely recommend it.",5,1
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"So it is a bit pricey, but I have been using this for 3 years now and have gotten my money's worth.  My room is in the downstairs basement of a 2,000 sq ft house and my daughter's room is upstairs as far as you can get from my room.  (why so far away- it's a long story that has to do with an aging live in grandma).  I get perfect reception.  They say sometimes Wi-Fi can interfere.  My house has 4 computers and 2 tablets that all use Wi-Fi up the ying yang.  I have never had a problem with my monitor, except once when my two year old learned how to unplug it and the back up battery went dead after a few days, but even then the receiving end will beep.The CB- talking feature of the monitor is great too.  I don't know how many times I have simply told my now 2 year old daughter that mommy loves her please go back to bed over the monitor rather than having to lug myself out of bed (at 12 midnight) and march up the stairs.It's also fun to hear her make believe play when I'm working at my home office and she is in her room playing princess or pirate, etc. It's a bit like eaves dropping.  :)",5,1
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"This monitor is expensive yes but can you really put a price on your child's safety? It's totally worth the cost. We have had a couple of different monitors with tons of interference. This one is perfectly clear. I also like that it has lights that light up so even in a loud room, you can 'see' your child crying or needing you. The 'talk' feature is also cool...""Mama's coming baby""...love that. Well worth the money if you've had issues with other monitors. I would have given it 5 stars except it's not as loud as I'd like... sensitive but having a louder volume would be good for us (with a 4 year old in the house - it's always loud in here). Buy it - you won't regret it.",4,1
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"We LOVE this monitor.  It was completely worth the money.  It has a long range on it (we can use it all over out 1500sq/ft house - including outside) the volume control is great, and there is zero static.  The sensitivity level can be set so high that we can actually hear our little girl breath - makes my heart at ease!My mom ended up ordering one of these off Amazon.com and hers didn't work that well.  For some reason the parent part of the monitor had a difficult time connecting to the baby part of the monitor.  She called Philips Avent and their customer service was incredible.  Not only did they replace her monitor, but they sent her the upgraded version with the LCD screen.  Hers works perfectly.I would buy this again and highly recommend it.Edit 1/20/2011:We are now on our third monitor!  Our original one ended up having the same issue as my mom's - the parent unit said it was linked to the baby unit, but you couldn't hear anything.  I called Philips Avent and they mailed me a new one (this was in July 2010).  They sent me an exact replacement.  A couple of weeks ago the same thing happened again to our second monitor.  I called Philips Avent and they just mailed me another replacement.  I asked them if this was normal, and they said it wasn't.  If this third monitor fails again I'll be sure to post another edit.  It's a bummer because when the monitor actually works it rocks.",4,1
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"After reading all reviews on the Avent Dect monitor, I was cautiously optimistic.  We already have a Graco monitor and needed another one that would not interfere with it.  I decided that this was the best option and it seemed a lot of the negative reviews may have been due to operator error.  At first my husband complained about the same thing others did, the volume was low and hard to hear our son.  Once I adjusted the sensitivity level, it was perfect.  I can hear my son perfectly and there is no interference with our other one!  We are very happy with the Philips Avent monitor.  The only negative would be the bright blue lights on the parent but we just turn it away.",5,1
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"We stopped using two earlier versions of baby monitors because the static and other interference was horrible.  Now that this technology is out, it is absolute heaven.  We purchased this recently getting ready for baby #3 and have been trying it out in the bedroom of our older kids.  There is TRULY no static or interference.  We charged the batteries according to instructions--took a number of days to do the full drain-and-recharge process.  Since that full initial charge, we have had no problems with draining.  Then again, we keep it on AC power in the master bedroom all night, and our older kids are in school during the day, so it is only on battery power in the mornings and in the afternoons/evenings, when we usually have it down in the kitchen while the kids are upstairs playing.  I'm seriously contemplating keeping it in their bedroom and buying a second one for the baby, because it is so handy to use the walky-talky feature with the kids.  But I'm not sure how well two would work in the same house.  As for the reviewers who commented that they couldn't hear the baby breathing . . . if they're worried about hearing their baby breathing, they ought to just sleep in the same room (in which case they probably still wouldn't hear them breathing).  Sounds like new parents (we've all been there).  If there are serious health issues, there are crib-mat monitors and alarms that health providers can steer you toward.  But that's for the fraction of a percent of people who actually have issues.  Otherwise, the previous multiple centuries (millenia) of babies breathing and sleeping just fine ought to be some sort of assurance, if combined with not reading scare stories on the internet.  Monitors are to let you know when they've woken up enough that they won't go back to sleep (they're not to let you know that there was a 5-second period of wakefulness, at which point you go rushing in there and buy yourself another 2 hours of wakefulness).  I haven't looked at this technology combined with video--might just use our old video monitor with the sound turned off, and then this for the audio, rather than spending the money.  But if you don't already have a video monitor, and this technology is available with video, I'd recommend it.  The video is SUPER handy to find out whether baby just was tossing and turning, vs. whether you have a full-blown rebellion on your hands in there.  The perfect thing for us would be this system, with video, and with multiple base sets so you could use it in multiple kids' rooms.",5,1
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"We had an inexpensive baby monitor at first, but found out soon that the neighbors had one too. :( All we could hear was what THEIR transmitter sent, not OURS.This baby monitor is perfect for us. We only hear what OUR transmitter sends. We have also had no interference from any wireless networks or telephones. This setup is a champ.The display lights are REALLY bright and are annoying to us. But you can get used to them. Or, if you want, you can use them as the sound indicator instead of the speaker.The monitor is very quiet (even at MAX volume). This is fine in our case because we use it at night time when we are sleeping.We have been using it for over 2 years now and it works great for our needs.The rechargeable battery in the monitor now only last for about three hours, but we mostly leave it plugged in to the wall anyways.I would have given it 5 stars if it were louder.I would DEFINITELY buy another one, if I needed one.",4,1
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,Met my needs perfectly the range of the parental unit seems to be even better than advertised. I highly recommend it,5,1
Philips AVENT Digital Screen Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"I've been using this monitor for several months and the more I use it the more I like it.  The best thing about it by far is the sensitivity setting.  When I first transitioned my son from the bassinet next to our bed and into his crib in his own room, I had the sensitivity set on high.  On this setting I could hear every little noise that he made in his crib.  After a few days of this I realized both that my son was fine sleeping in his crib and that hearing every little grunt, gurgle, or snore that he made in the middle of the night was keeping me awake in the few hours when I should be sleeping.  So I turned the sensitivity down.  If my son is in the other room making little grunting noises in his sleep the monitor will turn itself off after a few minutes.  Somehow the monitor notices that the tone of the noise in his room isn't changing and is relatively low pitched so it will just stop transmitting.  But if my son starts to cry, the monitor notices a difference in the sound in the room and turns itself back on.  How perfect is that!  It's like the monitor knows when I need to hear what's going on in my son's room and transmits it but let's me sleep otherwise.  It means my ability to sleep has improved dramatically (SO important with a newborn) yet I'm instantly aware if my son needs me.  Knowing that I'll hear him if he needs me but not being able to hear him if he doesn't means that I've started sleeping like a baby (or at least sleeping when my baby sleeps).  This alone puts this monitor on my list of baby products I couldn't live without.My second favorite feature of this monitor is the sound indicator lights.  There are five lights on the top of the monitor that light up with increasing sound level.  I get one to two lights if I have the music mobile on in my son's room but I can get up to 5 lights if my son is really crying.  This has two benefits.  One is that it helps me wake up to have both light and noise for those 2am or 4am feedings when I've already been up a couple of times and I'm exhausted.  But I use it more for times when it'll be hard to listen to the monitor or I don't want to listen to the monitor.  For example, it's great for letting me take a shower.  I would never be able to hear the monitor in the shower but I put it on the counter where I can see it while I'm showering so I can see if my baby's crying even if I can't hear it.  One time I called into a meeting at work and I was able to mute the sound on the monitor and use the lights instead.  It's also helpful if I'm watching TV to make sure the sound of his cries doesn't get drowned out.A few other points:* The range on the units is great.  I've brought the monitor all over my house and outside and never been out of range.  If you do go out of range, though, the monitor will alarm to let you know.* I live in a densely populated area with tons of personal electronic equipment, wireless networks, and the like around us.  I've never had a problem with interference and never picked up a different signal.  The digital technology is fantastic.* I never use the nightlight or the lullabies.* I like the way the batteries work.  The parent unit is like a portable phone.  I have the charger on my bedside table and just stick it back in the charger when I go to bed.  The nursery unit is like an alarm clock -- it's meant to be plugged in but it has back-up batteries just in case.  The back-up batteries are great in case of a power outage, which we've had a few of this summer.* The temperature seems to work correctly on my unit and pretty closely matches our house thermostat.  I don't find it especially useful because we have central heating and air but I do use it to think about what kind of blanket to put on my son and to make sure he isn't getting too hot or too cold.* The backlight on the unit isn't great but because I don't really care that much about the temperature read out, which is the only reason you need it except for the setup process, it doesn't bother me.* I find the monitor to be plenty loud enough but I use the lights as a back-up indicator when I'm doing something with a lot of background noise.* I've only used the talk feature once or twice.  Our house isn't big enough for it to be more useful than just walking into the baby's room but others with bigger houses might find it useful.",5,1

"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Sea Turtle",The person I bought this for told me the lights are very pretty and they loved it.

The turtle is so cute!,5,1

"Carters Easy Fit Velour Plush Crib Fitted Sheet, Chocolate","Our daughter was always migrating to her sheet saver in her crib, so we decided to get her sheets that were really soft everywhere. These are perfect! The only flaw is that they are just a hair big and not quite as fitted as the other sheets we had, but they're fine. They wash well.",4,1
"Carters Easy Fit Velour Plush Crib Fitted Sheet, Chocolate","Our infant daughter would only sleep on these sheets once we introduced them to her.  If we tried to put on regular sheets on her crib mattress, she would have a very restless night.  The next night we would put these back on and she would sleep great!  Very soft for sensitive infant skin.  Perfect size for standard crib mattresses.",5,1
"Carters Easy Fit Velour Plush Crib Fitted Sheet, Chocolate","This is perfect. I bought it for a baby who wouldn't sleep in his crib. Don't know if it's helped him sleep, but it is soft and fits the crib matress perfectly with a waterproof pad underneath.",5,1

Jeep Car Seat Travel Bag,I took my little one on his first plane trip and this cover was the perfect fit for our car seat. Everything arrived intact and clean.,5,1
Jeep Car Seat Travel Bag,"This bag makes lugging my daughter's car seat through the airport much easier. The bag is pretty heavy duty and is still holding up after 3 domestic flights. There are some scuffs but we are still going to be able to use it. It fits the Chico keyfit infant seat and dock perfectly, with room for some stuffed animals or other small things you don't want to take on the plane.Highly recommended for traveling parents that don't want to use a garbage bag. The carrying strap alone is worth the purchase.",5,1
Stroll-Air 24&quot; Universal Stroller Handle Handlebar Sleeve Cover,"The foam handle cover on our stroller had a slight tear and I was worried that continued use would only make it worse. This cover was the perfect solution. It has provided a durable, soft cover for the handle and protects it from any further damage. Almost two years later, it still looks great and functions perfectly.",5,1
"Stokke Tripp Trapp Highchair, Red","This chair is perfect for our 3 year old daugther.  We were using a booster seat that on one of our kitchen chairs, and while there was nothing wrong with that, whenever we had company we were short a chair.  This chair allows our daughter to sit with us while eating dinner and she feels like she is not missing out.  The only reason I did not give this chair 5 stars is because of the price, it's expensive.  From what I've read it's an investment and something we will have for a long time, but still a little too much.  I do like that I can sit and use it myself if I need to.",4,1
"Stokke Tripp Trapp Highchair, Red","We debated long and hard about the Tripp Trapp after seeing the scary video of a child pushing himself over backwards on youtube. I think the most important thing for anyone thinking about buying this chair to consider is what your flooring and table design is like. We have hardwood floors plus a table with a fairly shallow lip. After thinking through how the chair works, we decided to give it a try and for our dining set up and for our 11 month old son, it works perfectly. We've been using it for about 5 months now and are as happy now with it as we were at first. We love having him sitting right at the table with us and he's super comfortable sitting in the chair, especially with the place to set his feet. I love how adjustable the seat and foot rest are. The only thing I'd mark down on the chair design is the harness - it's a little tricky to adjust and can be difficult to get secured. Other than that, I'm happy we bought this when our son was young, it's going to be used for a long time in our family.Pros:*Excellent design & manufacturing*Lots of options for adjustment, fairly easy to adjust (except harness)*Nice to all eat at the same table*Durable*Nice looking*ComfortableCons:*Harness is a little tricky to adjust*Be aware of the flooring and table design you plan on using this withAdditional note: we considered buying the infant set to use with the chair, since we got the chair when our son was about 6 months old. We decided not to purchase that based on reviews here on amazon and elsewhere, and I'm glad we didn't spend the money on it. I highly recommend getting this placemat to use with the chair to protect your table:Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Green",5,1
"Carters Everyday Easy Printed Boa Blanket, Blue Star","My son had a ""blankie"" since the day he was born and became attached to it so much he had to sleep with it every night.  It was called his ""star blankie"".  It went everywhere with him when he would spend the night at grandma & grandpa's, etc. We traveled to Michigan in October and spent 2 nights at a hotel. Needless to say, we lost the blankie during our stay.  We left word with the hotel and called them for a week afterwards inquiring about the blankie. My son was devastated!  I searched online for a new blue star blankie and came across this one.  It is almost identical to the original one we had.  I ordered it and my son absolutely loves it!  It is more plush and a little larger than his other one.  It has worked perfectly and now my son sleeps with his new blue star blankie!  He told us that this was a perfect new blankie. The blanket is quite comfortable and a baby would love to be cuddled in it. Way to go Carters! thank you!",5,1
Nursery-To-Go 3-Piece Wicker Storage Basket Liner in Pam's Petals,"I didn't have any of the problems of the other reviewers.

I bought 2 sets of these and the baskets - love em!",5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn","I registered for and received other swaddle brands.  However one of my mom girlfriends gave me two of these Swaddle SleepSacks as well - one cotton and one fleece.  I really loved them and never used the other brands again.  The sack offers a nice benefit of a gown for your newborn.  It keeps her snuggly and offers easy access for diaper changes.  The swaddle part is awesome for a secure swaddle - there is some serious velcro that allows your baby to stay snug.  The cotton version was perfect for my summer baby (having air conditioning in our home) and the fleece one was great as we entered fall and winter months.  Once baby no longer needs the swaddle the sack is perfect for sleeping, I used a long-sleeve onesie underneath for warmth.  Only caution is while doing laundry - make sure you have all the velcro secure or avoid washing with delicate clothes ~ if the velcro attaches itself to other piece of laundry you may ruin something.  The material/zipper is durable and will last a long time ~ planning on using someday for baby #2. Sizing is accurate according to height/weight.  I have gifted these to friends since and highly recommend them.  This is definitely one of those ""need to own"" baby items.",5,1
"The First Years Take &amp; Toss Toddler Flatware, 16 Piece","I bought this set when my two year old was just beginning to eat more solids and have just bought a second set for our new little one. I wouldn't recommend this for first time feedings (4-6 months), as the spoons are a little wide, but these are perfect for when babies are a little bigger and can be used all the way until they transition to silverware. The forks are not sharp at all. Perfect utensils to let your little ones play with and get used to.",5,1
"Naturepedic Waterproof Flat Portacrib Pad, 24x38","This is a thin cotton faced waterproof pad that I use everywhere.  Unlike other itchy scratchy waterproofs, I am happy to let my 4 month old lie directly on this, with just a cloth diaper to catch any messes.  It is the perfect size for my pack and play, or even wrapped around the narrow side of her crib.  Most of the time it lives on the carpet next to her activity gym so she can have plenty of space to roll around.It is not a fitted pad, it is not an absorbent pad, but in my mind those are pros.  (dries faster, no hot polyester, no need to wash every time if you change the cloth diaper fast enough, faster bed changes)It washes well, and dries in the same amount of time as the rest of her laundry.",5,1
"Naturepedic Waterproof Fitted Crib Pad, 28x52",We have 2 of these - one on the crib mattress at all times. They have been 100% perfect in protecting our mattress from leaks at night. Would definitely recommend.,5,1

"Prince Lionheart BoosterPOD, White Base/Lemon","I never imaged I would be so happy with a booster seat purchase, but I love this seat! Our toddler started using it a little before she turned 2 (maybe around 21 months?). It sits her up at the perfect height, the low profile of the seat still allows the chair to fit almost all the way under the table when not in use, it cleans easily, and the color blends in with our dining set (I am not a bright pink/purple/green kind of person, lol). We use the seat mat that is made by Prince Lionheart, too). Love this seat!",5,1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Cut-to-Fit Sun Shades,"We've had this sun shade for over two years now, and it's still going strong.  I even moved it from the driver to the passenger side of the car last year, and it still sticks!  I was a little worried that it might not be reversible, but apparently, it is.  Despite what the instructions say, we used a spray bottle of water to get it stick perfectly smoothly.  We also used a pretty heavy-duty squeegee to smooth out all of the bubbles.  I love this so much that I'm here to buy a second one for the other side of the car... baby #2 is on the way!",5,1
"Ju-Ju-Be Be All Diaper Bag, Lotus Lullaby","I bought this diaper bag before my son was born because as a college student I always used a messenger bag and I thought this would be the perfect diaper bag. My son is now 4 1/2 months old and the bag is still very useful. The reason I bought the Ju Ju Be bag was because of all the features, the best one being the magnetic closures.  I don't have to worry about making a lot of noise since it does not have velcro closures. I was also sold by the insulated bottle pockets, but soon realized that I had no need for them. The ""mommy pocket"" is nice to have, but if you put too many things in there, the bag ends up looking bulky and the flap becomes heavy.  I can fit a lot of things in the bag and can hang it over my stroller, which is great because it tends to get heavy. I considered getting the stroller clips, but it turned out that I didn't need them for my stroller. One complaint is that the changing pad is small so I had to use one from a different diaper bag that I have.  Overall, I've been pretty happy with the bag, although sometimes I miss having a purse.",4,1
"Boon Flair Pedestal Highchair with Pneumatic Lift,White/Orang","This highchair is perfection. I got it about a week ago and am so in love with it, probably because i bought it to replace my first highchair, the bright starts perfect place, and it is so infinitely better in every way. of course i paid a lot more for it (even though i bought it from a store's overstock for a really good bargain) but it was worth every penny for the time and frustration it saves me on a daily (hourly!) basis.The seat just wipes clean. that's it. if something is stuck, you spray a bit of cleaner and then wipe it off. my daughter is already 18 months old so she pretty quickly let me know that she wasn't interested in the foam pad, so now the chair is even easier to clean. my daughter likes to drop her food on the floor, but it doesnt get very far, because she can just drop it over the side instead of feeling the need to THROW it over the sides of a huge tray. so the base gets lots of food dumped on it, and i just sweep it with the broom and everything comes off.The bright starts footprint was particularly large for a highchair, and it drove me crazy, didnt fit in my small kitchen at all. the boon shocked and delighted me by fitting into the one extra space in my kitchen, 2 ft wide max, a little corner space that now happily hosts my highchair, and it's totally out of the way.It moves so easily, a little bump over thresholds but nothing compared with what i was dealing with before. you just put your foot on the back of the base and tilt it over the threshold. and of course the brake just locks it (you can still move it a bit, but it wont move by itself, or from a little kid pushing it).the tray...well what can i say, i'm excited every time i wash it. it's tiny, fits in the sink, easy to wipe down, comes with TWO tray liners which snap on and off easily (when brand new, the tray liners were very hard to get off...but by now they are already much looser and easy to get off). this works amazing as i keep kosher so i have labeled one 'dairy' and one 'meat' and they just pop into the correct sink when she's finished eating. takes a second to wash with a sponge. even the actual tray is super easy to wash with a sponge, and it actually FITS IN THE SINK (i have big sinks but it would fit in a small one too).the straps come out for cleaning etc, SO EASILY! but not easily enough for baby to get them out. i have already taken out the shoulder ones because my daughter would never wear those. but i always strap the lap ones and then put the tray on, and they dont bother her. they are super easy to open as well which is so great when you're trying to get out a dirty squirming baby.i dont really get the fancy pneumatic lift - i suppose i dont need it at this point in my life so i havent really tried it much. it seems to me that it's very hard to get the chair to go down, a little easier with baby in it, but still hard, and anyway it says you're not supposed to do it with baby in it.  i guess when i need it ill give it another shot.it does wiggle a little as some reviewers noted but the base seems so heavy and solid that it never concerned me.also i noticed someone said the crevices around the crotch bar don't clean well...i have not found this to be the case, it wipes down fine.2 things i would suggest for the boon flair manufacturers:-make the straps plastic (or vinyl, whatever it is) like the fisher price easy clean! they do get pretty dirty, but i will try washing them in the machine as one reviewer suggested.-make the button for the lift on the back of the base, near the brake. food coming down from the tray does get into the crevice there sometime and it's annoying to clean.otherwise, thanks for thinking of all the moms out there cleaning meal after meal, and creating this masterpiece!!",5,1
Infantino Noodle Teether - Bug,"All the other teether toys I have were a complete bust.  The noodle teether however, was a huge hit.  The little legs were perfectly shaped for him to gnaw on & it's a cute toy to boot",5,1
"Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy, Navy/Red","Wherever we go, you can tether the toy-most, with these little guys.You can toss the toys from stroller, high chair when out eating, grocery basket.Perfect for the 'toss' game all kids play.Nothing goes very far at all. Never touches the dirty floors.Great idea and great purchase",5,1
"Made For Mom No Spill Bottle Cap System, Red, 3 Piece","I bought this for our 1 year old to help make it easier to give him different drinks. We are on the road a lot and when we stop at the gas station and get him a bottle of juice, we would have to pour it into a sippy cup so he could drink it, but he would get mad that he couldnt have it in the original bottle even though the other kids could. These tops make it easier to give him the bottles and not have to worry about him being upset and throwing his cup or spilling. Unfortunately, though, these tops are not perfect. They do not stay on very well and they do not fit a lot of bottles, even though they come with 3 adapter rings to help fit them to different bottles. But they still helped and were worth the few bucks we spent on them.",4,1
"Made For Mom No Spill Bottle Cap System, Red, 3 Piece","The previous review almost scared me off from buying these tops. But I saw one pack left at Babies R Us, and grabbed it. (Laziness to experiment the several other expensive bottle tops on Amazon.) I placed a yellow adapter ring on a little Kirkland water bottle from Costco. At first, water shot out, but I think I squeezed the bottle too hard while screwing on the spout. When I shook the bottle upside down...no leaking. I squeezed water into my mouth...perfect. I vigorously shook the bottle upside down...a couple drips, but no big deal. So I give it 4 starts because it does the job. I have no idea why the previous reviewer poured water all over herself. Maybe she screwed the cap on too tight while squeezing the bottle?? Anywho, I'm excited to find an alternative to sippy cups, and a way to add more water to my kids' diet. It's worth the [...]. Word of caution...the packaging says not to use these toppers for dairy and carbonated beverages.REVISION: I've used the bottle caps for a week now and LOVE THEM. In fact, I went back to Babies R Us and bought 2 more packs. This time, I read the back of the packaging. It details which adapter ring to use for particular water bottles. Here's the breakdown:BLUE RING (""Course"" thread bands): Albertson's, Aquafina, Arrowhead (some .5L), Arrowhead 24 oz w/sports top, Dasani, Deja Blue, Fiji, Gerber Spring Water, Ice Age, Ironman Triathalon, Naya, Odwalla, Palomar Mountain, Ramona, and more.YELLOW RING (""Fine"" thread bands): Arrowhead (some .5L and 16 oz.), Ozarka, Kirkland Signature, Deer Park, Zephyrhills, and more.I bought Kirkland water bottles from Costco. The yellow ring fits perfectly. I tried the blue ring, and water spilled all over me, so you have to make sure you're using the correct adapter ring. These bottle caps work like a charm. Now my boys drink water without complaining for juice, milk, etc. I very highly recommend this product and happily update my review to 5 stars.",5,1
Its About Time - Baby is Brewing Teapot Timer,"These were exactly what I needed for my daughter's baby shower prizes.  I had inserted a reminder ""tea bag"" with ""A Baby is Brewing"" into the invitations, so the little tea pot timers with the same saying matched our theme perfectly.",5,1
"Thermos FUNtainer Bottle, Disney Princess, 12 Ounce",This are the perfect water bottle for my toddler!  She takes it to school and it still has ice when she gets home!  I absolutely recomend it!,5,1
"The First Years Compass B540 Booster Seat, Abstract O's","Perfect if you are traveling in cabs or other non-owned vehicles.  Folding and opening are both easy to do and it is easy to carry.  Wish I had a bag to place it in, but I am not out often enough.  It is very handing.  Curious to know if I can detach the back to transform into a booster seat.  Not quite sure.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Standard Neck Bottle, 4 oz - 3-Pack","These bottles are perfect. They keep my little one happy by preventing him from getting gas or spitting up. I've tried other bottles and always end up with a gassy baby who spits up after each feeding. With these bottles he's a happy little camper.Sure, there are a few more parts to clean but honestly, it's not that much work. I don't have a dishwasher so I wash everything by hand. I exclusively pump so every time LO eats a bottle gets dirty. That adds up to quite a few dishes to wash at the end of the day. I still don't mind washing the extra parts. I bought a few extra vents, reservoirs, and nipples. That way if I get in a punch where all my bottles are dirty I can wash the bottle and cap really quickly and have extra inside pieces. This usually happens because I push off dishes until I have absolutely no choice but to do them. lol. These bottles come with a brush to wash the inside pieces.I've never had any trouble with leaking. Just remember that you have to use all of the pieces. You can't just use the bottle and nipple without the reservoir and vent. It just doesn't work that way. If you try, it will definitely leak all over the place.",5,1
Schylling Tin Hot Air Balloon Mobile,"It is very cute and colorful, perfect for a boy or girl's nursery, it has a fun, old fashioned feel to it. It is packaged carefully to keep it from tangling, but remove it gently and hang it up right away or even hang it on a hanger if you're not ready to affix it yet.",5,1
Rocking Moses Basket Stand Expresso,"This stand is the perfect companion to my Serena & Lily Sausalito basket. It is the perfect height next to my bed. It was pretty easy to put together, it took 2 people to keep the parts alligned.",5,1
The Shrunks Indoor Toddler Inflatable Travel Bed,"This was a gift sent over seas. They just received it and really love it.I'm so happy. The mother says, since they travel a lot this is perfect.",5,1
The Shrunks Indoor Toddler Inflatable Travel Bed,This worked perfectly as an extra bed next to my queen bed in the guest room - smaller than a twin - large enough for a toddler - crib sheet fits and stays on and it didn't deflate with the kids playing on it. Very happy with it.,5,1
"Mobi TykeLight Jr, Blue",Provides just the right amount of light for our sons room. We wanted him to be able to see but we didn't want it too bright. This light is perfect for that. And he can hold it and play around with it and he won't hurt himself. It doesn't get hot. I also bought the one on a rechargeable base for his room too.,5,1
Princess Toddler Bed,"I love this bed. We looked at several beds, and we decided on this one because every KidCraft product we have purchased has been easy to put together. This was no expection - It was very easy to put together. Everything lined up and fit perfect. It is great quality and absolutely adorable! The only reason I did not give it four stars is because the crowns on the bed posts that was delivered are very different than what is pictured. I did not like them at first mostly because they were different than what I was expecting. I must admit they have grown on me. This is a great little first bed. My daughter loves the princess theme, and she looks forward to sleeping in her princess big girl bed. It made the transition out of her crib a breeze! A great purchase!",4,1
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Mini Bassinet, Toffee","perfect for what we were looking for.  I had borrowed a bassinet from a friend, but it bothered me I had to get up to be able to see my baby.  This co sleeper has the open side therefore makes it easy to see if your baby is sleeping and breathing.  As you can imagine being a new mom you feel a little uneasy the first few weeks.  I liked the size and color.  Reading other reviews I heard the mattress or lack there of was an issue.  I just threw in an extra changing pad cover I had and put a pack n play sheet over it.",5,1
"Evenflo 6 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 8-Ounce","I've been using these bottles for my son and I love them! They aren't too heavy but they are sturdy enough not to crack when dropped. The raised lettering on the bottles create grips that prevent the bottles from slipping out of your hand. It has taken a little adjustment on my part when using our bottle warmer. The milk heats faster and with less water in these glass bottles. These bottles come with the slow flow or first stage nipples and it is the perfect flow for my son who is now four months old. I haven't had any problems with leaks, the price is great, and the benefits of glass over plastic bottles make this a 5 star purchase. I will be buying more for our home and for future baby showers!",5,1
"Evenflo 6 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","We have nine of these bottles, been using them since our son was born (he's almost four months old now) and the bottles still look new even better (shinier). We traveled overseas with it, used it on long airplanes rides, dropped it on an asphalt sidewalk and it didn't break-this was impressive. It's so easy to wash and keep clean. When they were new they leaked a little bit when we shake to mix the formula but now they very rarely leak when we shake the liquid inside. It doesn't leak at all when you feed the bottle to baby though. I love glass bottles because I know for sure it's clean and I don't have to worry about deterioration or discoloration. It's a simple but functional product and you definitely can't complain about the price compare to other bottles out there. The bottles work great with all brands of regular nipples we've purchased (mainly to experiment but I went back and use the ones that came with the bottles anyway). I used it with Medela Swing pump and it fit perfectly. I sterilize them regularly using the microwave sterilizer since we don't have a dishwasher. I'm not planning on using other brand since our experience has been great so we'll just upgrade to bigger size when our son is older.",5,1
"Edushape Edu Tiles - Numbers, 10 Piece Set",I added this to a room that has other non-numbered Edushape tiles and it's a perfect fit.  It provides the same feel as their other tiles.  The numbers stay put during cleaning and vacuuming.  It's a nice addition for a kid's play space.,5,1
"Red, White and Blue Vintage Aviator Airplane Toddler Bedding 5 pc set by Sweet Jojo Designs","This looks so cute on my son's bed.  I've washed it about 4 times already and it still looks new.  It's not a heavy comforter, which is what I was looking for.  So if you're looking for a heavy comforter, this is not for you.  It's perfect for us!",5,1

"Tilty Sippy Cup, Clear, 7 Ounce, 2 Pack","This is a great product.  Simple, easy to clean, easy to assemble.  No BPA or chemicals.It goes in the dishwasher, cleans well (no small pieces or fiddly parts).  My daughter finds it easy to drink from.The no-valve thing is better for her teeth and her development - why do we teach children that it's okay to turn drinks upside down or hurl them around the room?!?  Other cultures teach their children to drink from open cups as soon as they are weaned, thereby saving a load of hassle.I am buying more tilty cups for friends.  The only problem I have with them is I wish they made a little lid that could go over the top so I can slip it into my purse/bag without fear of leaking.  Other than that, perfect product.",5,1
Badger Basket Company Sleigh Style Changing Table with Hamper/3 Baskets in White,"I love this changing table. It came right on time and my husband had not one problem assembling it together. I got this product in black and it looks beautiful with her sleigh crib. I love the baskets they are not white they are more light tan, but it fits perfect with her room decor. It is safe and sturdy and I could not ask for anything better. One bit of advice i would give you is if you want it to look extra nice for the nursery i would consider ironing the hamper because it has many creases in it from the folding. That is just a pet peeve of mine. Enjoy the product. For the price you got it for i would not complain. Perfection in a box!",5,1
Levana BABYVIEW20 Interference Free Digital Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Night Light Lullaby Camera,"It's fantactic, in only 3 mins is running. The only imperfection is on the sound, it is not always transmitted with the image.",5,1
Levana BABYVIEW20 Interference Free Digital Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Night Light Lullaby Camera,"We tried other video monitors, but no matter what the product, they all had problems with interference from wireless networks and phones.  The Levana Babyview20 worked perfect right out of the box with no interference and is dead simple to operate.An added bonus is that all the details are well thought out and executed.* The LCD monitor has a rechargeable LiIon battery so you can unplug and go anywhere within range and still stay in touch with your (hopefully) sleeping child.* The camera auto switches to night vision.  Other products require the user to flip a switch.* The camera comes with a mounting bracket that is useful and simple.* The audio sensitivity of the voice activated LCD monitoring seems to be just right (although being able to set it yourself would have been nice).* It's cute, much cuter in person than the pictures portray",5,1
"Safety 1st Vantage High Back Booster Car Seat, Nitron",Purchased the carseat expecting our second and current Evenflo carseat is to bulky to sit next to the infant car seat. Needed a carseat with a lower profile. It is exactly what we wanted and fits in my Toyota Corrola with the infant carseat just perfect. My 27 month old seams just fine in and was much easier to adjust to his hight then expected. Very happy with purchase.,5,1
Eddie Bauer Deluxe High Back Booster Car Seat in Astoria,"I absolutely love this car seat, it's one of the best priced seats for how well it's made, it's easy to install and move from car to car, and it isn't heavy either! My daughter hates car seats, she will start kicking and crying the minute she sees one but she really seems to enjoy this seat!! The only down side I could think of would be that there isn't really a head rest for sleeping, but that's common in car seats, so I bought a neck pillow (supports her spine and promotes good posture) for her and it's perfect. I also really like the reclining option and so does she!",5,1
Munchkin Traveling Flash Cards,"I bought these for the car and my daughter loves flipping through them. They are the perfect size for her and they keep her entertained, which was the purpose. I would recommend them especially since they include exotic animals, numbers in English and Spanish (1-10) and vibrant pictures.",4,1
Kolcraft Universal 2 Infant Car Seat Carrier,"I love this carrier because it works well with the Chicco infant car seat. It also has a roomy basket underneath for groceries, shopping bags, diaper bag, etc. We kept this in our car trunk for trips to the mall and store, and it worked perfectly. It fits easily into the trunk and the one-hand fold is awesome.",5,1
"Sealy Stain Protection Crib Mattress Pad, 52&quot; X 28&quot;",If you want to preserve your mattress I highly recommend this product by a name you can trust. Perfect for baby,5,1
WubbaNub Brown Puppy,"My wife & I were given a Clifford version of this as a gift. As we started to lose track of clifford, from the car, crib, grandparents house etc., I knew that I had to grab a new one.The WubbaNub is great. Soft animal for my baby to rub her fingers on, while soothing binky to help her sleep or relax.Some complain that the binky doesnt detach, and it's not safe to wash - however hand washing the binky and animal is acceptable. If  you want a detached binky do not buy this.If you know what you want, and what your kid likes, this is perfect. I will be getting more of these for my baby & any future kids I have/ my family or friends have. No doubts, or problems at all.",5,1
Nuby 14 oz Flip-It Leak Proof Straw Bottle,I must say I love this cup!!! Its 14oz and the perfect size for my daughter who drinks alot.Its spill proof and the straw is not exposed like some of the other cups where the spout is exposed.one draw back the straw is soft and my daughter tends to chew on it. thats why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5.,4,1
Sealy Baby Posturepedic Mattress,"I have twins on the way, so I wanted to be very mindful of the price of the crib mattresses we purchased. After all, some mattresses are very expensive, and I'm not sure that they are worth it. Originally, I ordered two of the Sealy Baby Ultra Rest mattresses, which were $59 from Walmart's Site-to-Store service, which I really like. However, when I picked them up from the store, I really wasn't convinced that they were firm enough for infants. The sides really didn't hold up if you put any weight on them at all. My husband helped me evaluate a few other mattresses there in the store and we settled on this one that is just $20 more - the Sealy Baby Ultra Rest, and returned the others on the spot.I found there was definitely enough of a difference to spend the extra $20 each, and I really think we made the right choice. This mattress is sufficiently firm, and it fits perfectly in the cribs we purchased. I would definitely recommend this mattress - it is an excellent value and great quality.Please let me know if my review was helpful in your inquiry or purchase ! Thanks",5,1
"Safety 1st LiteWave Travel System, Mesa","I bought this set after contemplating if it was boy/girl neutral. It is. It's perfect and so simple to put together. It's been four years since I needed a combo and boy how EASY they are now! lol!The only complaint I have is that it is SOOOOOO not the color in the picture. It is VERY dark, brown and not neutral or pale like the picture leads you to believe. It's chocolate and not beige. Not at all. It's definately more boy then girl!It's funny to see what Amazon has it listed for now - as I got it SOOO much cheaper! Whoo! I'm so glad I bought this awesome product and you will be too!",5,1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free ISIS iQ Duo Twin Electric Breast Pump, White","I absolutely love this pump. It is light-weight and very, very easy to assemble. It comes with an instructional DVD that gets you started. Using the pump is a breeze. All parts are easy to clean and sterilize. I bought the Avent microwave sterilizer and all parts fit in it perfectly. I find it easier to take the pump out of its carrying bag but you could also leave the pump in the bag while pumping. The pump provides great suction and I am able to finish pumping between 10-15 min.The noise level is just fine. You can hear the pump motor but it is relatively quiet. The insulated cases for transporting bottles are great.I am very happy with this purchase.",5,1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free ISIS iQ Duo Twin Electric Breast Pump, White","I have a low milk supply but this pump does what it needs to do to get out what little milk I have!  The letdown cushions are great.  They work better for me than the flanges alone.  The motor does make noise but it's not annoying.  The pump is easy to put together and use... easy to read instructions.  I have the entire Philips product line so its great that everything is compatible with the pump... parts fit perfectly in the sterilizer... can pump right into bottles or VIA containers... it's very convenient.  The customizable pumping patterns are awesome.  I've never used another pump but I can't imagine only having set patterns for pumping.  I have used this pump in every way you can; manual, single electric and double electric.  All are effective ways to express depending on what the occasion calls for.  The bag it comes in is super cute & it includes lots of useful accessories!  Well worth the money!",5,1
"Lambs and Ivy Enchanted Forest Hamper, Green","This hamper is exactly what I expected. No surprises with what was sent. Our baby hasn't arrived yet, so I have not used it yet but it appears to be well made and I expect it to hold up. The colors are perfect and match well with the Lambs and Ivy bedding.",5,1
"Trumpette Howdy Bouncy Rubber Cow, White","My niece is short for her age so the rody inflatable horse is too tall for her, but the howdy cow is just right. Plus, she loves barnyard animals. Perfect gift.",5,1
"Philips AVENT ISIS Manual Breast Pump, White","This seriously has to be one of the items I am most thankful for.  When my milk came in, I was so engorged that I could barely even touch my chest without being in pain. I used this from very early on (earlier than people would recommend) but I have had no issues with breastfeeding.  I used it in the beginning to relieve engorement.  Then after I established a pretty good routine, I used it to store extra breastmilk.  My baby is almost 5 months old and I dont use it as much now but it was def one of those items where I got my moneys worth.  My only thing is (and this is a personal preference and by no means an issue with the pump itself) is that I dont like to use plastic bottles but luckily I have chicco glass bottles that attached to this pump perfectly.  Love it.",5,1
The First Years Breastflow Starter Set,These bottles are perfect for when my baby was having nipple confusion. My only complaint is that they tend to leak. I made sure that the cap was screwed on tightly but I think I may have received a defective batch of leaky bottles.,4,1
"The First Years 1 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce","This is the only bottle on the market that doesn't just *look* like a breast, but *functions* like it. The baby needs to use the same sucking technique as she does on the breast: the tongue is under the nipple and plays a part in the suckling. With all other artificial nipples, the tongue is used to *stop* the flow.This is the perfect bottle if you want to do combination feeding (breast and bottle) while minimizing frustration for you and your baby.I'm not an expert on this but I know about my own baby: after 2 months of being bottle-fed (for medical reasons) with Medela bottles, she refused the breast *not* because ""she had to work harder"" or because ""the milk flows too slowly"" (are you kidding me? the milk was spraying all over the poor baby's face! Much more likely, the milk was flowing too fast!).It was clear that she had forgotten the *technique* for nursing. She didn't latch right, but more importantly, she had forgotten where to place her tongue and how to use it.I thought it might help to reduce the difference between the breast and bottle suckling techniques, so I started doing some research on artificial nipples.The Breastflow nipple was the only one I found that is ""like the breast"" in a sense that is actually relevant for the baby (rather than just look or feel like the breast. How ridiculous to even try to mimic that).Not surprisingly, the baby refused this bottle just as she was refusing the breast.After we eventually managed to overcome this spell of ""nipple confusion"" (with the kind and selfless help of a wonderful La Leche League volunteer), I had to go back to work. We had to go back to at least 2 bottle feedings daily.But now we had the opposite problem: the baby was refusing the bottle!We tried other bottles, but not surprisingly again, now the only one she agreed to take was the Breastflow bottle.I wish we had used it from the beginning - she'd probably never have gotten ""confused"" in the first place.",5,1
The First Years Soothie BPA Free Starter Set,"We bought the Soothie bottles #1 for their overall value and #2 lots of good reports on them.  I was not disappointed!  This is the best gift set you could ever give someone who is having a baby.  I just had my 4th child in August and she took to these bottles fantastically!  This set comes with handy containers to hold formula or snacks that attach to the bottom of the bottle and they lock in place and do not fall off!  These also do a wonderful job of venting air and do not leak.  They also provide the perfect flow for my newborn so she is not gulping and drooling down the side of her face. I used to use Avent, but they are so overly priced and after hearing all the bad reviews this year with the poor construction on them with their new BPA free line, I just decided it was not going to be worth the added cost.  Glad I made the change!",5,1
"Lambs and Ivy Enchanted Forest Wall Appliques, Green","My husband and I recently received these wall decals to match our woodland themed nursery for our little one who is scheduled to arrive in a few weeks.  We wanted a bedding collection that was gender neutral, as we are waiting to be surprised if our baby will be a boy or a girl. We both have been very pleased with the Lambs and Ivy Enchanted Forrest collection in that respect.  These matching wall decals are adorable, very easy to work with, and are reusable, which is great in case you decide to place it one place on your wall and then later decide that you want to change the location a couple days/weeks/months down the road.  These decals have really helped add personality to the walls of our nursery.  They also coordinate perfectly with the rest of the Enchanted Forrest collection.  Overall very pleased with this purchase.",5,1
Kidswitch Light Switch Extender- 3 Pack,These are perfect for our two year old! He loves being able to turn on and off the lights by himself now!,5,1
Naturepedic No Compromise Organic Cotton Oval Crib Mattress,"i've had my naturepedic for 2 months now and am really happy with it.  i like that it is waterproof so my son will not be without a bed if he has a leak.  it is really firm, which we like because we think it is good support for his growing body.  it fits the stokke perfectly.  we already have a set of stokke crib covers that came with the stokke when we bought it and they all fit this mattress perfectly.there is no weird smell from this bed when we received it.  the mattress does not overheat his body as he sleeps, that i really like as well.",5,1
"Graco Modern Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Zurich","We love the design, the color, the style, everything about this pnp. We purchased this exclusively instead of a crib and have no regrets. My 4 month old has since out grown the changing table but we still use the diaper compartment.  She is still in the bassinet and she's a big 16lb 4-month old baby. So it is sturdy and comfortble for her. When she gets a little older, we'll let her sleep in the bottom section. I purchased a 3"" mattress pad for the bottom that fits perfectly and will be her bed until she can't sleep in it anymore!",5,1
Fisher-Price My Little Lamb Deluxe Infant Seat,"My baby loves this seat! He was premature, so it was a perfect place to put him in for a nap or for extra soothing and comfort. I LOVE how soft the headrest and body are. I wish I'd had something like this when I was a baby! Not that I would remember it anyway!:)When I purchased it, I got it for a steal. $30 from $60. So I already loved it because of that! I can't tell you how many times this product has kept Sammy entertained when I needed to get homework done, or take a shower. I would bring the lamb seat in the bathroom and put him in it while I showered. He would either fall asleep, or just sit there and listen to the music and enjoy the vibration. I know it really soothes him. I've only seen him bat at the hanging lamb a couple of times; I'm not sure why he's not more interested in it? Overall though, I have loved this product, and I know he has too. I would definitly recommend it to a friend!",5,1
"Graco Sweet Slumber Sound Machine, White","This product is exactly what we were looking for in our son's room. The noises and volume options are perfect. However, his room needs to be pitch black and any little light distracts him and keeps him awake. Sadly, there's a blue light that glows inside the machine and it can not be turned off. It's not the night light I'm talking about. For now I was able to put it behind a chair in his room and that seems to being doing the trick. I just really wish there was a way to turn it off so I could love this product.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Potty Training, Froggy","I'm potty training my third child and this potty seat is by far the best one we have had. With my first son we had several; the most expensive to the cheapest available. We settled on a Graco 3-in-1, but I never truly liked it..too many parts for drips of pee to get caught in and was difficult to keep clean. I knew I didn't want to use it again for my child third. The FP Froggy potty is perfect! It's just the right size (my 2 1/2yo is small for his age but this potty seat is not too big nor is it too small). The best part is that there are no cracks/crevices where drips of pee can get into. The splash guard is all built in, nothing to catch his boy parts on and the splash guard actually functions the way it should! The whole bowl just lifts out and you dump that into the regular potty. It's very easy to keep this potty seat clean and it's very functional.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Potty Training, Froggy","This green and blue froggy potty is perfect for little boys.  No more worries about over spray, because the front is high enough to keep wee-wee in the potty.  It is also very easy to clean.",5,1
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","I obsessively read reviews on everything before I make a purchase, and it's about time I start writing my own, so here it goes...I purchased this mobile a few weeks ago for my twins, who are now five months old. It fit perfectly and simply on a convertible crib. The way the fastener appears to me, it would fit on any crib. It has a highly adjustable strap. It has two volume levels and three settings: sound only, sound & movement, or sound, movement & projection. There are also three different types of sound: heart beat, nature sounds, or music. The music is very pleasant. It is a soft medley of Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven. Once the babies are too big to have a mobile in the crib, the mobile portion can be removed and you can still use the sound and projection. It has a pleasant design, soft colors, not gaudy.  It also has a remote control, which is very useful for a few reasons. I can turn it back on without getting too close to disturb the babies. Or if one baby is happily playing in the crib while I'm nursing the other, I can easily turn it back on. So far I have had no problems, and we are still on the original set of batteries. We use it very  often, as my son and daughter both love it. I cannot compare it to a similar product, as this is my first one, but I am very satisfied with my purchase.",5,1
SwaddleDesigns Lightweight Marquisette Swaddling Blanket - Pink Striped Fish,"I live in Dallas, TX and with our temperatures reaching 105 this weekend I am soooo thankful for this blanket.  My son is 6 weeks old and LOVES to be swaddled.  Unfortunately most blankets make him sweat like crazy... until now.  This blanket is perfectly lightweight and easily swaddles him.  He's happy and cool.  The best part... the instructions on the tag directly on the blanket... even my husband can swaddle him with ease.  These are a MUST for any summer baby.",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original - Green, Spirit","Greatest product ever! My son lived in his Classic from 8 lbs until he was approximately 28 pounds (1 1/2 years old). We went on daily walks for 1-3 hours at a time. He could sleep in it & breastfeed in it. Having him close to me really strengthened our bond- rather than having him in a stroller. It was also really easy to use. I was devastated when he was too big for it. I tried to move over to the Ergo, but found it to be way more complicated to get on & off and also found it not to be comfortable. I also tried a wrap system, which was comfortable, but which took ages to get on & off, and which had tons of material that ended up being wrapped around you which was too hot. I really missed the simplicity of being able to whip my son in or out of the Bjorn in seconds. When I was pregnant with my 2nd child, my friend gave me a new Active Bjorn. I was really excited about the new Bjorn, but when I put my infant daughter in it, I was horrified at how uncomfortable it was. I also didn't like all the extra straps (confusing) and all the extra material (too hot). My Classic was faded quite drastically (I purchased it used) after so much use, so I wanted to get a new one for the new baby. I wanted a Classic (technically a downgrade from the Active) since they're WAY more comfy, and was delighted to find a Classic in pink! It is positively the best thing ever.The reason the Classic is better than the Active is because you can adjust the diamond in the back of the Classic to alter where the weight is being carried. You cannot do this with the Active carrier- at least, not that I am aware of. Once the baby is in the Bjorn, you need to play with the straps and adjust the diamond to get the carrier in the right spot to be comfortable. When properly adjusted, it's fabulous. When it's not adjusted properly, it's uncomfortable. Many people who say the Bjorn is uncomfortable probably haven't adjusted the straps to the right spot for them (or else they are trying a different style of Bjorn, like the Active).I also don't like the Active Bjorn because the support in the back doesn't fit me properly (I'm quite slim). So it presses into me in places it may not do for larger people- causing it to be uncomfortable in the back support area.One final bonus of the Classic is that it doesn't wrap around your waist- so you never get the ""muffin top"" effect.My only complaints are that 1) you can't carry your child in it past 26 pounds (though I went past that to nearly 28 pounds, but would liked to have been able to use it much longer) and 2) I wish they made the Air carrier in pink.Perfect product.",5,1
"Bright Starts Bounce Bounce Baby Activity Zone, Neutral","We've been looking for a smaller entertainer that doesn't have the obnoxious color scheme that most of the exersaucers have.  This one fits the bill perfectly!Our 6 month old son is 20 lbs and 28.5 inches tall, so I was a little worried that he might not be able to use it long, but it fits him nicely, with plenty of leg room to grow with.The variety of toys keeps him spinning with glee and the bouncing platform gives him the leg exercise without using mom's lap as a springboard.",5,1
"Quinny Dreami Bassinet for Buzz Stroller, Breen","I was a little hesitant to purchase this Dreami bassinet. Most of the reviews are from 2009 and the Greystone was not offered in Quinny's 2011 line. It fits perfectly on my stroller which was purchased in 2011. I wanted something different but still gender neutral for our baby. I ordered the brown boost (which is more army green seat with robin egg blue) Quinny Buzz 3  and this Dreami bassinet in Greystone. It is not grey, really. It is dark purple and reddish orange. I still love it though. It looks fantastic on the frame and I have received a lot of compliments on the stroller itself but especially the colors. Exactly what I was looking for. It definitely stands alone in a sea of common strollers.",5,1
Evenflo Summit Easy Walk-Thru Gate,"I purchased this gate to keep my 2 dogs out of the garage when I am moving my car in and out.  After pricing the 'made for pet' gates at various pet stores and child safety gates at the hardware store I found this gate.  The price was about half of everything else I had looked at so I was skeptical that the quality would be what I wanted, but the review seemed to be ok so I ordered it.It came in very minimal packaging which was great.  I was a bit concerned about mounting it after reading the reviews about difficulties with the pressure mount install.  I had no trouble at all and had the gate out of the box and working in about 10 minutes.  I actually found it very simple to install.One of the selling features for this gate was the fact that it doesn't auto close.  I keep this open the majority of the time so if it automatically closed it wouldn't have worked for me.  It is also low enough for my cat to jump over, but not my dogs.  It is also very easy for me to open one handed so if I'm packing groceries or laundry I don't have to set everything down to open it.  I like how low the bottom bar is.  I easily trip over things and haven't yet managed to trip on this.While the pressure mounting does seem like it's very stable, I wouldn't want to subject it to too much pushing or shaking.  My dogs are very small, but if you have an active kid or large dog who is determined to get through the gate I wouldn't be surprised if they would be able to pop it out.  But if you just need to contain some small, non jumping critters this gate is perfect and a great value for the price.",5,1
Evenflo Crosstown Soft Portable Travel Gate,Our opening was exactly 60 inches and this gate fit perfectly.  It looks great and it is secure.  I can see how it would look strange if your opening was smaller as the fabric would bunch up but for an opening of our size it could not have fit better.  I highly recommend this gate.,5,1
Evenflo Crosstown Soft Portable Travel Gate,"I bought this gate for the bottom of the stairs so my 15 month old son can't climb up.  We have wide stairs 50"" so this gate is perfect.  So far, it's been holding pretty well.  My husband, 200 lbs, walked into once and it went down but I think it's due to his weight.  Other than that, it's been holding up pretty good for my son.",4,1
"Evenflo Big Kid AMP No Back Booster Car Seat, Red",Perfect seat for my four year old granddaughter. She is comfortable and can easily use buckle to unlock and hop out of car.  Saving my back!!  Love the color and drink holders.,5,1
Sealy Tender Vibes Soothing Mattress,This mattress fit perfectly into our crib.  Batteries are easy to get to but screwed in so that small hands cannot get to them. Vibration feature is strong enough to be felt through bedding without shaking the baby too much.,5,1
"Ameda CustomFit Breast Flanges, M/L","The standard flanges didn't create good suction and seemed to fit poorly these were a perfect solution for this problem.  The price was great and shipping was very quick!  Surprisingly there are two flanges and adapters in this package, we ordered two sets because we thought there was only one flange per pack.  Having extra's is handy because it makes washing a little less hectic.  I highly recommend these to anyone who is having problems with the standard flanges, this completely solved our problem.",5,1
Kolcraft Pediatric 1000 Mattress,We purchased the Crib and this Mattress together matching the size of the crib and the mattress. It fits perfectly with the crib and is a great value for the price. Overall we am happy with this mattress. The Mattress needs to be kept aside for a week before placing it into the crib to allow the air circulation through the material of the mattress.,4,1
Naturepedic Organic Cotton Changing Pad Cover,"Really comfortable for our son, not to mention the fact that it's organic is perfect since he's sensitive to pillows that aren't made for those with allergies, etc...",5,1
"Munchkin Munchkin Gate Extension, White, 2.75&quot;",We have an extra-wide space between our kitchen and stairwell that the regular gate JUST missed closing off.  This gate extension was a perfect fit and was super easy to add to the regular gate.,5,1
"Sassy Soft Sided Toy Organizer, Pink Mod",I love this toy box. I got it for my 15 month old daughter and it is so easy for her to get to her toys. It is the perfect size and just what I needed. I thought about getting her a wooden toy box until I came across this one. I don't have to worry about her getting hurt on it. I had it shipped to come in 2 days and I got it the next day. Very pleased.,5,1
Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate,"This is a genius idea! My son just switched over to his big-boy furniture, and I was able to toddler-proof almost his entire room (covers for the brick plugs, door handle covers, etc.), but I was at a total loss for making the night light situation safer.I tried a tap-light, but after one night (not even the WHOLE night) the batteries died. After MUCH searching, I came across this and purchased it through Toys-R-Us. It's PERFECT! Initially, after reading some other reviews, I was gonna let my son hold it at night, but ultimately decided the light THAT close to his face may keep/wake him up. I decided instead to keep it up on a shelf. I keep it set to the changing colors setting, and it stays on the ENTIRE night! I charge it up every morning and it's ready for use again at night!I ABSOLUTELY recommend this. It's unfortunate that so many people seem to have had problems with theirs, but ours has been working perfectly each night. Yes, it's a little pricey for a night light, but it's the safest one I've found out there. I'm VERY happy with this purchase!",5,1
Leachco Easy Teether XL Convertible Crib Rail Cover Natural Ivory,"I always found our little one chewing on the crib which wasn't good for it or those new little teeth so I bought this and the side covers. It has worked fabulously! We have a convertible crib like the one in the picture and the cover fits perfectly on it. It's very snug & hasn't come loose at all even with the little one's tugging and pulling on it. I also really love the 3 Velcro straps where toys can be attached. We only put toys on there that are extra safe in case they ever came off (nothing that could be swallowed, pulled apart, etc.). It couldn't have been easier to put on and it makes me feel more comfortable that it's organic and helps protect those new pearly whites. Even though it was a bit pricey, I think it is worth it and I would absolutely purchase it again!",5,1
"Thirsties Diaper Cover, Celery, X-Small (6-12 lbs)","Of all the cloth diaper covers I own, this is undoubtedly the best. It is lightweight, never bulky, and fits my baby perfectly. The double gussets make it effective without being suffocating, unlike the Bummis covers.",5,1
"BABYBJORN Travel Crib Light Fitted Sheet, Natural White",this is the only option for the baby bjorn travel crib so i was so relieved when it was of great quality. its thin and soft on the skin = perfect,5,1
BABYBJORN Babysitter Balance Air - Black Mesh,"This is BY FAR the best baby purchase we have made. I have tried many other bouncers and non made my baby as comfortable as this one. She has a bit of a spit up problem and they all scrunched her up, hurting her belly. The design of this one always kept her in a natural, comfortable position. The gentle bouncing from her weight is perfect. It's light and I carried it everywhere around the house with her in it. It's footprint is small and practical. The seat adjustment was great too. Now that she's 19lb, we only use it on the highest setting because her weight pushes it down a lot, so it's no longer a sitting position, more reclining. I can feed her in it too. She only loved this seat. I would recommend this to everyone! 10 stars. It's easy to wash too.",5,1
"Starting Small Monkey Novelty Hamper in Brown,  18 x 11 x 24","Love this hamper, exactly what I was looking for.  Very cute and bigger than I expected!  It is perfect for one load of clothes.  I have it in my baby boy's room.",4,1
"Starting Small Monkey Novelty Hamper in Brown,  18 x 11 x 24",What a great Hamper not that small look awesome at my grand baby roomPerfect extra gift!!!,5,1
"Joovy Room&sup2; Portable Playard, Yellow","I love this Play Yard.  I bought it for my grandson who comes to visit and spends one night a week with me.At 18 months old I need to have a place to contain him where he can't get into something that may hurt him.  This is perfect and he loves it which makes me love it.It's very roomy and the sunny yellow color makes it a happy place to play.I would recommend this Joovy Room 2 Play Yard to anyone who has children.  It's wonderful, it's spacious, it's very sturdy and it's a big play area for a child.I got this Play Yard at Amazon cheaper than any other place I shopped for it and it was delivered to my door within a week with no delivery charge.  Thanks Amazon.",5,1
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,"I used this with my first son, and loved it! It was so nice not to have to shake a bottle everytime for formula.  It helped ALOT with his gassy tummy. Now I'm using it for my TWINS, and it's even better!!  We go through so much formula, I couldn't imagine having to shake it every time.  Plus, I like to use the Drop-ins bottles, which don't shake very well, so this is perfect!  I haven't had the problem with warpage that some others have had.  All parts are still in tact as well.  Awesome product!",5,1
"My Baby Sam Paisley Splash 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set, Pink","Beautiful! Love the colors, bright and cherry. Fits perfectly and washes up nicely. Would recommend, baby can grow into this set.",5,1
Zoli Baby On-the-Go Snack/Formula Dispsenser - 2 oz,"I've received SO many compliments on this dispenser - it is perfect!  I can keep oatmeal, rice cereal, cereal snacks and formula all in one location - I was so tired of all the separate little Munchkin containers I was carrying around (and they took up a fair amount of space in the diaper bag).  I keep the little measuring cup from the formula container, cut off the handle, and put it in the top section of the dispenser - that way I can keep more formula than needed for only one bottle.  Highly recommended!",5,1
Sassy Bathtime Fun Appliques - 84 Piece Set,"We bought these for our 20-month old daughter to have some fun with learning numbers and letters. The size is perfect for her and, for the letters she knows, she can easily identify them. There are enough duplicates in the set to put together many words, too. We hang them up to dry in a lingerie bag and it works great. These are exactly what I was looking for, and I'd buy them again in a second.",5,1
"Kolcraft Cuddle 'n Care Rocking Bassinet with Light Vibes Mobile, Creampuff","I have used this for both my son, who is now 2 and my daughter who is 5 months old. My son loved the vibrations and music. The vibrations and music wake up my girl, but she loves the rocking ability. Worked perfect for both!",5,1
"Moby Wrap 100% Cotton Swaddle Blanket, Black",I love this blanket! Its perfect size to swaddle my 3 month old. It's not too thin or thick and made really well. Didn't care too much for the free hat but thanks anyways.,5,1
"Nuby 10 Pack Hangers, Colors May Vary","This is a good product but didn't work for the purposeI bought them for. I wanted them for a camper closet.Although they fit nicely in the space the clothes obviouslyare too big for the hangers and they fall off. For kidsclothes though (intended purpose,HAHA) they would be perfect.",4,1
"Recaro Signo G2 Convertible Child Safety Car Seat, Cappuccino","After doing a lot of research on different car seats, I chose to get the Recaro Signo G2 for our five month old.  Due to our work schedules, we need two car seats for my husband's and my cars.  I chose to get the Recaro first because of the additional safety features, and I wanted to see if it fit in both cars.  I knew it would fit into my husband's four door 2009 Chevy Silverado truck, and it did.  It is a wonderful car seat for his truck, and we can actually fit two adults sitting on either side with a center rear-facing installation.  I love everything about it.Unfortunately, we did not have as much luck fitting it into my 2007 four door Honda Civic.  While it fit perfectly into my car, it turned out to be too tall with a proper center rear-facing installation.  For one, it was easy to bump the baby's head on the ceiling of the car.  More importantly, it partially obstructed my view in my rear view mirror.  (I am 5'7"" and my husband is 6'2"", and both of us had the same problem). While I could 'mostly' see out of my rear window with the car seat, I do not find any obstruction an option with my baby in the car.  As a result, I chose to get a Sunshine Kids Radian 65 as it is better suited for my smaller car.",5,1
Jeep Stroller Weather Shield,Went to Disney and wanted something to protect our son/stuff when it rained.  Worked perfect!  I just wish I could fold it back up the way it came...but you never can.,4,1
Jeep Protective Floor Mat,"Normally I would just throw an old beach towel or rag rug under my sons high chair because he is a messy eater, but this thing has been worth every penny. Not only do we use it at mealtimes but it's perfect for sensory play time when we play with rice or dried beans In a shallow tub and my son dumps the items out while playing. At the end we just fold up the plastic mat like a taco and dump the rice or beans back into the sensory tub. It has also saved our carpet from play-doh stains and during bubble time. To clean, I just wipe it with a wet soapy rag and hang to dry, or just hose it off in the tub. I'll be using this under my sons art easel when he gets a little older.",5,1
Jeep Protective Floor Mat,"my LO throws her food off her highchair pretty often, and this is the perfect solution to protecting our floors/keeping us from having to mop every day!",5,1
Jeep Protective Floor Mat,You really can't beat this very cheap floor mat. It is clear plastic so it blends in very nicely to the rest of the room if you don't want to make it kid-centered. Others have said it smells - it had a slight plastic smell but after a day or two it was gone. The plastic is flexible but heavy so it does not lie perfectly flat on the floor.,5,1
Light Switch Guard (Toggle),This is an excellent product and is perfect for covering your light switch.  It helps to keep my child from switching our fireplace light switch and it has a clean look.,4,1
Light Switch Guard (Toggle),This is a very simple yet functional solution to the problem.  It worked perfectly for my two year old son.,5,1
"My Little Seat Infant Travel High Chair, Colored Stripes","we needed a high chair on the go for trips --- and this worked absolutely perfectly with our 11 month old. he was thrilled to be sitting at the table when he sat him in this in a bar chair height chair with everyone else at the dining table. BUT, we washed it straight of the package when we got it to get rid of the smell it came with -- and after that it looked like it was already 2 years old. not the best fabric colors because of that. but it works, and that's what's most important to us. would buy again, but maybe in another color....",4,1
Lambs &amp; Ivy Wings 6 Piece Bedding Set,"Lambs & Ivy has made a beautiful nursery theme for our little son on the way.  The fabric and colors are perfect, and very well crafted, well worth the price.  Since babies can't use the bumper or the comforter, our bumper will be on there for now for decoration, but the comforter conveniently has a space for a curtain rod to go through on the top, making it perfect as a wall hanging.  The valence is perfect as well, but we had to order an extra since there are 2 windows in the nursery.  This theme is perfect for anyone wanting an airplane-themed nursery.As an extra tip- get the wall appliques and the airplanes that hang from the ceiling to really complete the airplane theme.  The other items are a little overkill, but those two items perfectly complete the room.",5,1
Lulu Ladybug Rocker by Rockabye,Very cute rocker. My 9 month old crawled right to it and wanted to play. She smiles back at the ladybugs sweet face and likes the rattles in the feet. She enjoys rocking on it and the music seems fun for her. It is not big and prob best for sitting- 1 1/2 yrs. it does seem front heavy and would tip if too much weight rocked forward. Overall it's been perfect for a 9 month old .,5,1
Contemporary Blue and Brown Geometric Modern Baby Boy Bedding 9pc Crib Set by Sweet Jojo Designs,"This 9-pc crib set was received in a very timely manner. The colors look just like the picture (sometimes internet photos can distort reality). So far, I don't have any complaints. We actually matched the wall color at Lowe's and have painted the room like the picture. The crib sheet colors are complemented perfectly by the lighter beige. We chose a more mature look so that our nursery can grown into a toddler's room.",4,1
American Baby Company Organic Cotton Velour Pack N Play Sheet,I was looking for a sheet to use on my twin boys pack n plays for winter use. Something that wasnt cold to the touch and this sheet is perfect. Fit the Dream on Me 3"" mattress nice and snug. Will have to buy more to back ups so I dont have to wash while traveling.  I only as giving it 4 stars because I have never used this brand and have only washed them once. Time will tell if the quality is worth the price.,4,1
"American Baby Company 100% Organic Cotton Interlock Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, Natural","We are using our graco pack and play bassinet daily, and this is a must have addition. It is so soft, much more comfortable for the baby to sleep on, and is way easier to clean after spit-ups & accidents than the mattress itself. It fit the mattress perfectly - wasn't loose or have any major wrinkles when tucking it under. We also use it withAmerican Baby Company Organic Waterproof Pack N Play Mattress Pad cover, can use both together for ultimate comfort and cleanliness.",5,1
"American Baby Company 100% Organic Cotton Interlock Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, Natural",This sheet is great. It is soft and comfy. It perfectly fits the new Dream On Me Pack N Play mattress I just bought. Both items fit perfectly into my Graco Pack N Play. We needed a thicker mattress for longer sleeping.,5,1
"American Baby Company 100% Organic Cotton Interlock Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, Natural",These sheets fit perfectly to my pack in play mattress pad. They are holding up to the many wash so far.,5,1
"American Baby Company 100% Organic Cotton Interlock Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, Natural","I bought this specifically for the 3&#34; Dream on Me pack and play mattress and it fits perfectly.

American Baby Company Organic Lap &amp; Burp Pad - 2 ct,"So soft and perfect sized for a newborn. (Now she is growing, we simply let her head hang off the top half so the bottom is still protected well.)These would NOT make good burb pads in my opinion. Liquid takes a tiny bit to soak in so spit-up would run off. We use these on the couch for changing pads and for in the middle of the night on the bed changing pads.I want to buy 2 more so we always have them!P.S. Far better than the Boppy brand of lap/burp/changing pad covers in my opinion -- those are the scratchy terry cloth top cover and cheap. These are cushioned and oh so soft.",5,1
Nojo Toddler Satin Pillow,"My daughter likes the soft satin but her head slips off of it when she sleeps.  Through the recommendation of someone else, I also purchased the Bucky Pillow Case and it's a perfect combination.",5,1
Nojo Toddler Satin Pillow,Perfect my toddler daughter! She loves it!  It washes well & still looks good.  I may buy another one for traveling!,5,1
"American Baby Company Organic Cotton Interlock Portable Fitted Crib Sheet, Natural",It's fine.  Goes well with mini foldaway crib for visits from grandchildren.  Perfect gor small spaces and hones or apts.,5,1
Keekaroo Comfort Cushion Set - Cherry,"It's so sturdy, untippable when baby is pulling herself/himself up.  Also very comfy/cozy. It was recommended and was the perfect choice for in baby's house and for grandmother's house.",5,1
"Kids Line Jungle 123 Lamp Base and Shade, Brown","I love this lamp, and it's a perfect complement to my daughter's safari-themed nursery. The shade and paint detail are very nice.  A great feature this lamp has I didn't realize I wanted before was the silent switch (very handy for not waking a sleeping babe).My only issue with this lamp is that the bulb sits high in relation to the shade, and unless you put it high in the room (and miss out on the beautiful animals) you'll get an eye-full of blinding light when you walk in for your 4am feedings... Sub-optimal.Easy solution: I constructed a foil ""hat"" for the top of the lamp. Yes it looks a tad silly, and I recommend against incandescent bulbs if you do this, but no more 4am blindings.",4,1
"Kids Line Jungle 123 High Pile Blanket, Brown","So soft and perfect size. Got three of these to give out, because my daughter and granddaughter loved it so much. Perfect for floor play even. Great colors and durable, great price would pay more, but glad I didn't have too, thank you Amazon.",5,1
Boutique Baby Teddy Bear 13PCS CRIB BEDDING SET By GEENNY Designs,"Good quality, fits the crib perfectly, lovely colors and pattern. Great buy for the price, higly recommend it!",5,1
Jolly Jumper Bath Tub Toy Bag,This bag is a great size and holds a lot more than I thought it would. It also stays stuck to the side of the tub. I pull it down and scoop up all of my son's toys and then put it back on the wall. All the water drains out and the toys dry out. Perfect!,5,1
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Hallway Security Gate, Black",I ordered this along with the 39&#34; extension to close off a 7ft wide doorway. It arrived undamaged; (first hurdle cleared) and was installed in a few minutes with only a screw driver as I recall. It's pretty sturdy and fits that odd sized doorway perfectly to keep my kids from slipping out into the rest of the house to wreak havok. Now all the damage is isolated to one room!,5,1
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Hallway Security Gate, Black","I bought this gate because I needed something to separate my dog from a crawling 6 month old and it is perfect!  The quality is excellent and the style fits in with any decor.  It is easy to assemble but you must make sure that you have the correct extensions to fit properly as it does not expand.  It only expands as far as the springs which isn't very much.  I had to re-order another extension to fit the area I needed for the gate.  Once I had that in place, it has been perfect. I use the gate when the baby is on the floor and remove it when it is not needed.  It is light weight but sturdy and stores easily.  I looked at so many other gates and barriers and finally chose this one and I couldn't be happier with it!",5,1
Shi Shu Baby Handwoven Snuggle Blanket - Celedon,"Perfect size, very soft, my son finds it very comforting. At 8 months old, he's not become attached to any toys or blankets we've given him before this one. Now we take it everywhere and it really helps him to calm himself when he gets upset.I hand wash it and air dry it so that it doesn't get thread-pulls. The texture (one of the things my son loves about it) lends itself to easy un-raveling.My only complaint would be that it has two large sewn-in tags on it that really seem to take up a lot of space in the otherwise soft blanket area. Doesn't bother the baby yet, but seems like tag overkill to me.",5,1
"Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag, Black Dot","I was looking for a fairly large bag to carry all of the stuff that goes along with having a toddler and an infant.  This bag definitely fits the bill!  It's the perfect size!  I love all the pockets and the fact that it has four pockets for bottles (two inside and two outside).  The stroller attachments are a plus, too.  I highly recommend this bag, especially if you have more than one child!",5,1
"Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag, Black Dot","I have 4 year old, 2 year old and 9 month old boys...and I have tried every bag there is to try! I have been in the search for the perfect bag...stylish, useful pockets, large inside... I am not sure I would have thought to buy this bag as you are never sure about the quality when shopping online. I received the indigo dot as a gift and the quality is amazing! It looks like a designer bag, has the the most useful pockets of any bag I have tried and has enough space for me to carry around all 3 boys' things. I love it so much I empty it of baby gear and take it with me even when out by myself. I will definitely keep using this after my boys are past the baby stage. This is a very good gift idea!!",5,1
"Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag, Black Dot","I love it. My 3 kids are 7 and above, so obviously well past diapers, BUT, it is still the perfect bag for a busy working mom. I use it as my handbag/laptop tote during the day, and after work, take out my laptop sleeve, and use the bag as my handbag. Between my work schedule, and the kids' extra-curricular activities - little league, playdates, martial arts, etc - There is always something that 'mom' has to carry - whether it be glasses, baseball hat, extra sweater, waters, snacks, and yes, wipes. The organization is unbelievable, and the quality of the materials used is fantastic. They even use YKK zippers on this, which is phenomenal. Love it. Will be getting more colors, because at this price point, you sooooooo get your money's worth.",5,1
"Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag, Black Dot","I spent hours and hours and I mean hours looking for a good diaper bag! I looked everywhere from Etsy, Ebay, Babies R Us, you name it! I read blogs, and articles and Amazon Reviews for days to find something that worked for me. I found it in this bag!What I was looking for was something that didn't look like a diaper bag, one that didn't cost $200, one that would not show wear and not look dirty. I use cloth diapers and this bag is plenty big for me without being too bulky. This bag was for my 3rd child so I am not new to the diaper bag world. I just wished they would have made this bag when I had my first. So here is what I like about this bag.I like to have a lot of compartments for things like bottles, keys pacifiers etc. On the outside front it has a perfect pocket for my cell phone. It zips and unzips so smoothly that I can do it with one hand while holding an infant car seat. Below that pocket is a really wide pocket that works well for my keys, again zips and unzips with ease. On the outside sides, there are insulated pockets where on one side I keep a water bottle for me and on the other a bottle for baby. Above these pockets on either side are stroller clips. I kept reading about that before and I had no idea what they were but now they are my God send! They have a nice strap that wraps around the handles of a stroller or shopping cart or whatever and then clips inside the bag so I don't have to take up space in the stroller or in the shopping carts, and I have everything I need right in front of me without digging around looking for things. Now rotate around to the back is 2 pockets that do not have zippers and is a great place for me to put a book, magazine, Ipad, or wallet. I call these the &#34;me&#34; pockets.Ok now lets dig inside. On one side you have 3 open pockets with no closures. These are great for extra little things like socks, snacks etc. There are 3 of these! On the other side you have one huge pocket that zips closed. This is my pocket for my lotion, tampons, touch up makeup etc. On the sides of the inside there are 2 little pockets that for me are perfect for pacifiers!The inside in lined with a very easy to clean liner that so far has had no wear. The top of the bag has a sturdy zip enclosure. The zippers and straps all are really well made and I have had no problems with them.I honestly spent a ridiculous amount of time looking for a perfect diaper bag and I am so happy I did because I am thrilled with my purchase.",5,1
"Maclaren Triumph Stroller, Coffee and Silver",Awesome great maneuverability. Great lightweight perfect price. Maclaren really makes quality. Idk how long it will last bc I just got mines but it seems good,5,1
"Maclaren Quest Sport Stroller, Charcoal","I love this stroller for my baby girl!  I purchased it because my Chicco 3 in 1 stroller takes up WAY too much space in my car trunk.  This Maclaren Quest Sport is much more compact and doesn't take up much space.  It is also about 13 lbs which makes it easy for me to transport.  It is very easy to set up and take down in just seconds.  The only thing that I miss, which my bigger Chicco stroller has, is a cup holder.  Other than that, it's perfect!  Oh, one final note...  On this charcoal stroller pictured..... I thought I was getting a neutral color with the charcoal and red (in case we have another child that is a boy).  Upon arrival and opening it, I discovered that it is not red, it is a raspberry color and looks girly.  It is not a neutral color and would not be a real good stroller for a boy.",5,1
Skip Hop Swipe Baby Wipes Case,"I do not know why I am obsessed with wipes containers. It's a sickness, I know. Anyhow, I scoured the internet to find the perfect wipes container because I was sure that it was out there...and this one, though riddled with problems, is the closest that I have come to the perfect wipes container.The pros:1) I love the design. It looks modern, contemporary and cute.2) The strap it contains to hang it on your stroller is awesome! It prevents me from having to dig for wipes in the bottom of my diaper bag constantly when I just need to quickly grab a wipe to clean the baby's hands.3) This case holds a lot of wipes, is made of strong, thick plastic and is easy to clean. I hate the thin and poorly made travel Huggies wipes cases that I have used before, which are made from flimsy cheap plastic because you can barely fit any wipes in them. In contrast, the Skip Hop wipes container allows you to store a good amount of wipes in it and its plastic case is very sturdy.The cons:1) The red button that closes the Skip Hop wipes container is CONSTANTLY popping off! And as soon as it pops off the baby will inevitably grab the red button and throw it in a fountain or in some bushes or in some other crazy location which means that I have to hunt around for 10 minutes to find that button.2) When it does stay on, the red button sticks and is hard to slide from open to closed, and vice versa. So, when you are sitting there trying to change the wiggling baby with one hand and trying to open or close this wipes container with the other hand, you can just forget about it. There is no easily accessing the wipes in this container without tugging on the container and causing the red button to pop off into oblivion!3) Wipes tend to dry out if left in this case. The red button closure doesn't seem to seal the wipes in the case in an airtight fashion so if you leave the wipes in the case, you can go to grab them a week later during a messy diaper change and be stuck with a bone dry wipe. Not fun!My message to Skip Hop is this: Listen, this could be a GREAT case. You just have to work on increasing the functionality of that troublesome red button and you will have an almost perfect product.To those considering buying this case, call me crazy, but I would still definitely buy it again! Even with some quirks, it is still the best case out there in my opinion. No other case is as stylish as the Skip Hop case, or holds as many wipes with the added bonus of clipping onto the stroller like the Skip Hop case. I just recommend being vigilant about making sure to not lose the red closing button and I recommend adding a bit of extra water to your wipes if you leave them in the case for several days as they may dry out a bit. Follow those tips and voila, you have a fabulous wipes case.",4,1
Boutique Brand New GEENNY Lavender Butterfly 13PCS Baby Nursery CRIB BEDDING SET,"I wasn't going to get this after reading some of the reviews, but the price convinced me. This is a great product. I shop at high end stores, and this product would be equal to that. The bumper pad is thick, everything is plush, the colors are beautiful. A lot of ppl complained about the gold color in it. It is so minimal, and I think it is a beautiful touch. I was so excited when I took this out of the bag. It is perfect and exceeded my expectations. I'll definitly purchase this brand again :)",5,1

Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker,"Anyone who thinks preparing your own baby food is difficult or time-consuming should try this out.  It's so easy.  The baby cooker steams and purees perfectly.  It's easy to clean.  It's pretty effortless.  Just get a baby food cookbook and you can raise your little one to become an adventurous eater.  If you cook at home for yourself, there is no reason to not cook for your baby too- I only wish my meals were as easy to prepare as my babies'!",5,1
Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker,Better than the baby bullet - if for no other reason than it has a steamer which perfectly cooks annoying vegetables like peas.,5,1
Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker,"As with most things, this might not work for everyone. For us it's perfection. I like to make my son's food as fresh as possible because i believe in cooking in-season and local and i am not interested in making months worth of frozen stuff. I usually make 3 batches in a row and portion them out, which gives me about 3 days worth of food.If i do zucchini and carrots it takes 25 minutes from start to finish and most of that time, it's steaming and i don't have to pay attention. Initally i made everything special, but now i add things we already have and simply puree them. Tonight we are having mix veggies, brown rice and slow cooked pork. I put a spoon of each, blended and voila!Yes i could take out a pot, steam, then take out a blender and have a mountain of dishes. Instead i just wash this...it is perfection!I must say i find the price steep. You can easily find a used one and that's the way to go.",5,1
Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker,"This product is simply amazing. Steams fruits and veggies perfectly and the food processor is phenomenal. Very easy to use and even easier to clean. I truly enjoy making my baby's food. One tip I have found is to remove the water left after steaming into a glass cup and slowly add it back to the bowl while processing. The lid must be on to blend the food, so it will take you a few times to remove the lid to add the water; however, you can control the consistency of the food this way. Mommy and baby are really happy with this purchase. :)",5,1
Jolly Jumper Stroller Clip 2 Pack,"I use it with my bumbleride indie stroller. It fits perfectly and was easy to install. I usually clip on my diaper bags, or handbag, most of my bags have either hooks or loops or a metal hook by the strap. It can be a little hard to undo it, but i dont mind, because there s no way my bag will get accidentally un-clipped. I like them and they are perfect for what I bought them for",5,1
"Boutique Brand New GEENNY Safari, Jungle Animals 13PCS CRIB BEDDING SET","I had been looking around for the perfect nursery set and I found it!!! We are adopting in May and are expecting a boy. I had wanted to do a safari/jungle theme that was going to be neutral and AFFORDABLE!!! There are many sets out there but you only get 4pcs for up to $200 not including purchasing the extras. Only upset is that there is only one sheet. I will have to purchase a few extra sheets that can match the set, but for starting out this is the one I would recommend to friends.",5,1
American Red Cross Automatic Night Light,"I had this in my son's room soon after he was born for almost two years now. Love it! It turns on/off automatically, so I don't need to touch it at all. It has soft light, perfect when the baby sleeps at night - not too disturbing and enough for me to check on the baby. It's flatter than other nightlights I got and feels more secure on the wall. My son has never run into it or tried to pull it out.I plan to get another one for my second baby.",5,1
Disney Winnie the Pooh Sequined Diaper Bag by Dolly,I love this bag. I don't use it as a diaper bag. I carry toys and coloring books etc with me when we go places like the doctors office and you need to keep the kids occupied while you wait. Perfect size for that.,5,1

Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub,"i have purchased this bath tub about a month ago when my 6mo old son was not fitting in his infant tub anymore. i can say I am very pleased with this bath tub. Since I inflated it a month ago it did not loose any air. My son loves it, there is a lot of room to splash :), I love the drain, no problems with that at all. Fits perfectly  in my big bath tub. This tub is for babies who are sitting on their own, not for infants who can't sit yet. I loved the price too, i am going to get another one for our upcoming trip to Europe.",5,1
Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub,From the first time we put her in it our daughter has loved this tub. The nice cushiony bottom and soft sides allow her to lay back or sit up and takes the worry from us away that she might bump her head or hurt herself in the regular tub. My baby is is 6 months old and this seems to be the perfect transition from the infant tub to the big tub. We also plan on taking it on an upcoming cruise because they dont have tubs on board and this is so easy to inflate/deflate and travel with.... definitely recommended!,5,1
Boutique Brand New GEENNY All-Star Sports Boy 13PCS CRIB BEDDING SET,"I just received this bedding set today. I was a little nervous because the price was so low that it wasn't going to be the best of quality. When I opened the package and started pulling out the pieces I was amazed at how intricate the set was! There are many different types of materials (corderoy, suede etc.) used for the squares and sports balls giving it so much depth and detail! The stitching is perfect, as are the colors, and even all the extra wall hangings and decorative pillows are made so nicely. I am so pleased with this purchase!",5,1

Natura Classic Crib Mattress Pad,"This mattress pad has been perfect!  I liked it so much, that I purchased a second one to rotate when I'm washing the other one.  I was looking for a pad that didn't contain any smelly waterproof plastics.  I had initially purchased a pad from a popular kid's store, but the smell was almost nauseating.  I couldn't imagine laying my baby to sleep on something that smelled so terrible.  This pad did have a natural wool smell when I first received it, but after washing a couple times the smell is completely gone.  They fit on the mattress well and wash well too.  I line dry them, and haven't had any issues with shrinking or wrinkling of the pad.  My son has had a few leaks, but the pad has done it's job and kept anything from leaking onto the mattress.",5,1

"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Walk-Thru, Neutral finish",We have been very happy with this gate so far!! fits perfect for us and would recommend it to anyone who needs a gate for a large space,5,1
"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Walk-Thru, Neutral finish",I know that many people would subtract a star for the fact that it does not automatically close.  After extensive research we could not find a gate this size that did so it doesn't feel right to knock a star off for something that other similar products don't do. It is actually nice to be able to leave the gate open during bedtime and nap time.Our Son is a 1 year old tank - 32lbs+ and 33+ inches and the gate hardly moves when he pulls himself up on it or attacks it.Installation was relatively simple (we went into wood door jams over a 6ft span).  Required a little work to line everything up and the gate can be somewhat unwieldy so a helper is a good idea.The screws do extend on either side to help make the gate easily adjustable to fit perfectly.  I know some people complained about this but it isn't really an issue (aesthetically or safety-wise) and makes installation easier. Our 1 year old has found spinning the little nut that holds the screw from loosening to be a lot of fun.  Doesn't seem to affect the overall stability of the gate so no biggie.We were hoping/led to believe this gate is white.  It is actually closer to a bisque.  This annoys my wife but I can't see how being off white hinders the gate's ability to function properly so I'm not subtracting stars for that either - just note that it is not stark white.There are not a lot of these sized gates out there and this one is great.,5,1

Summer Infant Complete Coverage Color Video Monitor Set with 7&quot; LCD Screen and 1.8&quot; Handheld Unit,We purchased this for our third child and wish they had them around for our first two! I love how portable it is. The picture and sound quality is great. Perfect for any parent!,5,1
Summer Infant Complete Coverage Color Video Monitor Set with 7&quot; LCD Screen and 1.8&quot; Handheld Unit,"We bought this monitor set when we were expecting our baby girl (who is about to turn 3) and although I'm sure there are better more high-tech models on the market now, for us this has been perfect (and we still use it to check in on our little girl). Having the big monitor next to our beds made it so much less stressful to put our daughter in her own room when she was 6 weeks, and having the handheld connected to our downstairs TV made checking in on her periodically a snap. Some things to note: 1. you will only see the beautiful color picture when it is light in the room, as most babys sleep in the dark,what you will always see is the infrared (?) version, 2. if you have the handheld monitor hooked up to your TV and you accidentally bump it, you run the risk of losing your signal and will have to mess around with it until you have a good picture again, 3. Unlike many other monitors, the sound never shuts off, if you turn the volume on it will always be on, which can be distracting when you are trying to sleep.This has truly made two incredibly worried parents able to relax a bit, plus you get a front row seat to all of their practice sessions, I bet most parents don't get to watch their babies practice sitting up and standing and all of the other wonderful things that they do while they are ""sleeping"" :)",5,1
"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Extra Tall Walk-Thru, Bronze","Gate works perfect bought to contain/separate 3 large dogs.

Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Crib Mattress,"Was worried about changing her mattress after having the same one for two years. She didn't seem to notice the difference. Her naptime lasts a little longer now, not 100% sure if it's the mattress or not, but that is the only change made to her naptime routine. Transition her again to a toddler bed and it fits perfectly.",5,1
Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Crib Mattress,"We ordered this for our DaVinci Kalani crib.  It fits perfectly. It is very firm on one side and a little softer on the other which will be nice for when our little one gets older.  There was no stinky-chemical smell at all.  It was lightweight and easy to pick up.  We have not used it because our baby has not arrived, yet.",5,1

"BabyKicks 3 Pack Joey-Bunz, Small","My son just turned 1 year old, and is a heavy wetter since birth.  He wet through his fuzzibunz diapers over night, even with both stuffers in at the same time.  We switched to disposables at night, but he soon began soaking through those as well!  I searched online to find an answer, and decided to try the joey-bunz.These work perfectly.  To avoid the many, many washes recommended at the outset, I washed them by hand using dishwashing liquid.  I find this works well when diapers need stripping, too.  I just follow them up with lots of rinsing, and a normal wash cycle with rockin' green detergent.I add one joey bunz to the cotton stuffer that I use in my fuzzibunz, and we have no more nighttime leaks, and even better - no more waking up at night due to a wet diaper/pajamas/sheet.They did shrink a bit and do fit in my fuzzibunz onesize.  I think they are listed as not fitting those diapers specifically, and I'm sure they wouldn't fit if the diapers were on the newborn or very small sizes.  But at one year, we're on elastic setting 1, and they fit with a bit of room to spare.",5,1
"BabyKicks Natural &amp; Organic 10 Pack Baby Wipes, Blue","i just received these wipes in pink, i purchased 2 of the packs based on user reviews. i do intend to use these as both wipes and washcloths. the size is perfect, any bigger and they would get in the way, all over the place. the size is perfect to wipe the bum a few times..or to use for sponge baths and first sink baths. a lot of ppl seemed to mind the tag, and when i ordered them, i assumed they would be huge, whereas in fact they are not too cumbersome at all. they are about 1/2 inch wide on each wipe. mine had a tag on each wipe. they are located on the bottom of the long end, so u can easily work around it. and once the child is about 2 months old, they arent so sensitive and wont even be bothered if the soft tag brushes against their toosh. all in all, i would definatly recommend these. one side is rougher, im guessing it makes it easier to wipe up mess from #2, whereas the soft side iss just for a wipedown. i use my own wipe/bath solution using cetaphil, baby oil, and water. just a squirt of  the first 2 and fill the rest of the squirt bottle with water. after openning the diaper, just squirt a few times, and wipe. easy. i gave this 4 stars only because i sort of wished the company would make a slightly darker color...perhaps a khaki or brown. just a bit more appealing with the pink or blue sttitching. also they shrink very slightly in the wash, so that was another point lost for these wipes. but i still would buy again if needed to.oh! one more thing, these arent perfect circles, they are elongated...which is better than what i expected! gives u more surface area to use when wiping!***UPDATE***I've been using these wipes for about a month and a half and found them useful for EVERYTHING!!! I use some as wipes, some as washcloths, and a few are designated as cloth diaper liners to use during rash time, or jjust to make cloth diaper clean up easier! cheapest cloth diaper liner u can find!",4,1
"BabyKicks 3 Pack Joey-Bunz Premium, Small","My son is an EXTREMELY heavy wetter. I use these with the gDiapers liners for everyday use. They don't fit perfectly in, but I'm able to fold it down without too much bulk added.I also use these as a doublers for the Fuzzibunz one-size.A few things to note: 1) You should really pre-boil these about 10-20 minutes to help let the natural hemp oils out. Otherwise, they won't be very absorbant... ask me how I know. :P 2)the thread holding these together can be snipped to turn 3 liners into 6 AWESOME! 3) a few people have complained about drying time, since I've snipped the thread that holds the two sides together, I've not experienced this unless I'm extremely sleep deprived and forget to empty the lint trap. Which is a saftey hazard and can cause your house to burn down if you don't clean it out.",5,1

"Baby Trend Expedition Double Jogging Stroller, Skylar","So I did a lot of research before finally settling on this stroller, but I'm so glad that I finally did! I have the single jogger of this stroller and have been VERY happy with it, but I wanted to make sure that I was making the right choice by picking the double. It is awesome and for under $200 you really can't go wrong.No, it won't fit through a normal doorway, but it's a double stroller, what do you really expect.The front wheel can either swivel or be locked into place- great feature! People had complained about the front wheel in the swivel setting being loose, well, tighten the bolt! In the assembly instructions it tells you that if it feels too loose to tighten the bolt on top of the wheel- problem solved!The back wheels lock easily into place and can be easily and quickly removed if needed- and no, they won't just fall off if they are clicked into place.The sun shade is great and can be pulled to protect from the sun no matter where it is coming from.People had complaints about the under carriage basket for things like a diaper bag was too small because it is divided into 2 sections, but if it was just one section, I think things would just drag on the ground- this provides a little more support.It is a great size for my 7 month old and my 2 year old- and has lots of growing room as well! It seems like it will fit both of them for a long time!The parent tray/cup holders are great- perfect for a water bottle and the cell phone and keys!I didn't get the one with the MP3 hookup, but it could easily carry your iPod and portable speakers (or just your headphones!).Overall, this is an excellent product! I've never owned a BOB or one of the more expensive strollers, but I can tell you that if you're looking for a stroller that works and is awesome, than look no further than this one. To me, there's no sense in purchasing the more expensive stroller because ultimately, they do the same thing!This  was very easy to assemble and took me just a few minutes- without the help of my husband!Great stroller!!",5,1
"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green","I purchased this seat for my daughter around 4 months old because she was showing signs that she wanted to be seated upright, but lacked the strength to do so on her own.  I was considering the Bumbo when I stumbled across this seat.  I liked the idea of the tray and later use as a booster seat.  Once I received it, I found it very easy to put together.  The tray slides nicely and my (rather large) baby fit in it perfectly.  The reason for the 4 stars however, is that I noticed the underside of the tray has some ridges on it that I felt could scratch my baby's toes if she were to get excited and kick hard.  I solved this by simply putting socks on her feet and never had a problem.  Also, it was a bit difficult to carry this seat one-handed with the tray attached while holding my baby in my other arm.  If I tried to pick it up by the tray, it would fall off and grabbing the orange part does not work either because that part is removable.  So I had to try to slide my fingers under the green part, which was heavy and awkward to carry in that manner.  I do feel that this seat may have helped her with sitting as she was sitting almost unassisted by 5 months.  All in all a good product, easy to keep clean.  I would recommend.",4,1
"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green","We call this ""The Enterprise,"" because it looks like the baby is in his own little space ship!I originally bought this for my son when he was around 12 weeks old.He had excellent neck control, and he alway wanted us to sit him up, so I thoughtthis would be perfect for him.He really liked sitting up in the chair from the start- But,  I felt his abdominalmuscles were not strong enough for the chair at this age.After a few minutes of sitting in the chair, he would slouch down and kind of bob hishead a bit. I tried putting a rolled up blanket behind his back, but I was worried it was not good for his back.I ended up putting it away for a few weeks.At about 4 months, when he started getting really bored with his activity play mat,I put him back in the chair. This time he was sitting up better and fit the chair a lot better.He is almost 5 months now, and we use it every day, He really loves playing with the toys now.I also have the rainforest jumparoo, and he honestly prefers this little chair.My only complaint is the tray. As some of the other reviews mentioned, the tray is a bit trickyto get in. I find it a bit frustrating, but I don't mind because my son loves the chair,and it frees me up for 20-30 minutes.I think for the price, this was a really worthwhile purchase!",4,1
American Red Cross Door Finger Guard - 2 Pack,"These are great because they stop fingers from getting caught at both ends of the door. We all think about the latch side, but it's easy to forget that little hands can get smashed in the hinge side, too. This is the perfect solution. We have been using ours for over a year, and they still work great. Some of them have been cracked from an adult trying to close the door, but they still work fine. They just get a crack at the top. I recommend these to everyone I know with toddlers in their life.",5,1
Kimberly Grant Spa Baby Musical Mobile,"I purchased this mobile as an accessory to the Dwell Studio Owl bedding.  The colors match perfectly!  I wasn't crazy over the green arm cover so I decided not to put that on the mobile and left the cream exposed.  There are tags on each square that I had to cut off which was kind of annoying.  Overall, the colors match perfectly to the bedding so I am satisfied.",5,1
"Dorothy Jane Unique personalized Darling Baby, keepsake birthstone leather gift,Babys 1st christmas","I'm soon to be a new dad, with a little baby girl due about a week before Christmas.  I was looking for the perfect gift for a little girl:  what else but shoes?  I found the Darling Baby shoe people through Amazon and ordered a pair of these Dorothy Janes, customized with our daughter's name on the sole of one shoe and ""First Christmas"" on the other.First, let me talk about the customer service, which was simply incredible in this day and age.  How about a personal email within a couple hours, letting me know the order had been received?  Then, another personal email within a couple days, letting me know the shoes were en route (they were early!).  When the shoes arrived, they came in a beautiful box, which contained a blue velvet bag containing the shoes and a congratulations card for the pending birth of our daughter.The shoes are just as advertised:  incredibly cute; just perfect for a little girl.  The customization was just right.  The craftmanship is evident in every stitch.  Eric (a third-generation shoemaker, according to the high-quality business card enclosed with the order) obviously knows what he's doing.I hardly ever take the time to review a product I purchase on Amazon, unless it's really dreadful or, alternatively, really great.I'm happy to report this is one of the latter.  Can't recommend this enough.  If you have a baby coming, or know someone who does, this is the PERFECT gift.  And if you're a guy and do this on your own, be prepared to receive major kudos from your wife.",5,1
"The Baby Bunch Cupcakes Box of Two - Yellow, 0-6 Months",I bought this as a gift as well as others like it with the same theme and everyone at the sprinkle party loved t. It's definitely a creative idea and fit the baby perfectly.,5,1
Angel Dear White Lamb Lovie Blanket,I have been looking for this for several years. This is the perfect baby shower gift. Our children loved these (there is a variety of animals available). Easy to travel with and washes well.,5,1
Under The Nile Organic Cotton Baby Wipes - 6 Pack,"We use these as diaper wipes and they are the perfect size.  Big enough to do the job, but not so large as to drag through the mess.  Have been using from birth to 12+ months and still work great.",5,1
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Bassinet Mini Plush Sheet, Natural",This sheet perfectly fits the co-cleeper mini.  It is way more cozy than the regular sheet that comes with the co-sleeper.  I washed and dried this in the machine with no shrinkage issues.,5,1
"JJ Cole Mode Diaper Tote Bag, Cocoa Tree","This tote style diaper bag is perfect! First of all, I am extremely picky about the setup of my purse. In my purde now it is very organized and when I take something out, it goes right back in where it was. This diaper bag has multiple pockets inside and out so everything has a place and the structured form of the bag makes it very easy to keep everything in place. There are 6 exterior pockets and 6 interior pockets, the material is easy to clean and comes with a wipeable, matching changing mat.Also, I love the style. All the designs are very modern and there seems to be enough variety that everyone will find the one they like best. I preferred the lemon posy because it is bright and cheerful. I also will be getting the matching pacifier pod and travel wipes case. The ability to get additional items in matching print is a bonus I am happy about!Lastly, I also like the simplicity of the bag. This bag being structured and modern is perfect size for any new mom. However, I do hesitate to say it would be perfect for a mom with multiple babies. You can fit doubles of everything, but it would be a very tight squeeze. I would recommend possibly a second diaper bag or maybe just a larger bag.I hope this was helpful!",5,1
"JJ Cole Mode Diaper Tote Bag, Cocoa Tree",This bag fits well when hung from a stroller.  I like the size a lot.  It can be a little small when I try to put my inflatable ""mybrestfriend"" pillow in it but I think for most people it would be the perfect size.  I've been complimented on the color/pattern (gray and yellow flowers) a lot.  Good price and great bag.  Not too girly for my son but very nice looking.  Good quality.  I like the stroller hanger straps that it came with.,5,1
"Boppy Cottony Cute Slipcover, Emily's Garden","The Boppy Cottony slip cover was just that, &#34;Perfect and Comfy.&#34;  I liked the color  too, and the shape was most helpful for my sore hip.",5,1
"Boppy Cottony Cute Slipcover, Emily's Garden",This cover is cute.  I've washed it a few times and it hasn't changed shape.  It's soft and matches my jungle theme perfectly.,5,1
"Boppy Cottony Cute Slipcover, Emily's Garden","I ordered 2 of these to cover a couple of boppy pillows I borrowed from a friend for the arrival of my twins. They are adorable and fit perfect. The only reason I gave them 4 out of 5 stars is because the fabric is not very soft, it is a little stiff. It did soften up slightly when I washed it, so I hope after multiple washes it continues to soften.",4,1
"Munchkin Mighty Grip BPA-Free Glass Bottles 3-Pack, 8 oz,Colors Vary",exacly what I thought ! perfect glass .. perfect size..looks better in person ..nice and shiny and carefully packaged.,5,1
"Boppy Noggin Nest Head Support, Brown Wheels","I bought this for my 5 month old daughter who has had some flat head syndrome since about 1 1/2 months old.  I only wish I would have known about this sooner.  It fits great into my graco snug ride carseat and she goes right to sleep in it.  The fit of it would have been perfect when she was a newborn too, as they all seem to flop around a little in their carseats on the ride home from the hospital.  It is very padded and soft.  Definitely recommend this product.",5,1
"Boppy Noggin Nest Head Support, Brown Wheels","I wish I had heard of this product before my son was born.  It is a perfect solution to the ""flat head"" syndrome that so many babies now suffer from.  It is the perfect size so it easily fits in his swiong, bouncy seat, boppy lounger pillow, etc.  Will def. use from the start with our next child.",4,1
"Boppy Noggin Nest Head Support, Brown Wheels",My son started to develop a flat spot. Well by the time I found this product he was already moving his head around....so he didnt like laying on this too much. BUT I know if I had started to use this from day one he would have a perfectly rounded head.,5,1
Eddie Bauer Infant Travel Bed the On-the-go Sleep and Play Solution,"We traveled with my 10week old son and I didn't want to get a crib for him since I've heard such bad things about hotel cribs and this was perfect.  small, lightweight.  We put a towel under it since some people said the bottom wasn't very thick and he did fine sleeping in it",5,1
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","Of course, there were good and bad reviews for this gate but I thought I would give it a try and I am not sorry.  It arrived well packed and was easily assembled as the instructions were clearly written.  The gate actually comes in 2 main pieces.  The main section and an extension for wider doorways.  I did not use the extension.The instructions said to mount the gate 3 inches off the floor but I didn't want it that high so I used the flat side of a 2 by 4 to rest it on while installing it, making the height about 1 1/2 inches off the floor.  It worked perfectly.  The gate is all metal except for a few small parts.  When the gate is open, I'm sure it is wide enough for anyone to get thru.  So, I give it 5 stars and would recommend this gate to anyone.",5,1
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",Used this as a pet gate and it works perfect! It is easy to open and very secure! Great purchase for the price! Doesn't look like a cheap baby gate!,5,1
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",We have an elderly dog that we need to keep in certain areas of the house and these are perfect.  Easy to put up and walk through when you need!,5,1
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",This gate is eaasy to install and the perfect height for our growing puppy who is still learning his bounderies. The loock & latch is easy for us to use but hard for him to figure out. The steel frame also helps in him not chewing it to pieces.,5,1
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","This gate works great however if you have smart babies like mine...  well...  they can figure it out (at 10mos old)...  I have to make sure that the red latch is snapped tight every time or my twins are everywhere they shouldn't be :) - otherwise, it is the perfect solution for our family!",4,1
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"Fits perfectly my deck and match the white color. Very practical with the little door, to block our dog from going smaching the flowers in the garden. Just what we needed!",5,1
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,perfect for dog.easy to installlooks good  -- not trashyfits very wide or small doorwaywe bought two for our dog,5,1
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,We got really tired of climbing over our standard expandable gate - this one is perfect. It is easy to operate one handed and is very convenient when guests come over.,4,1
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"My dog was tearing down traditional baby gates, climbing over them by using the small holes in the gate to propel herself over and running rampant through the house while I was at work. I needed a verticle bar (prison style :)) solution to prevent her from escaping. This swing gate is perfect, tall enough, and easy to install and use. If you follow the clearly written directions, you will have no problem with this gate.My only negative comment would be that the bottom rail can present a hazard for tripping. Once you get used to it being there, and step over it when walking through the opening, you won't have any problem. This is far outweighed by the convenience, and ease of operation installation! I highly recommend this gate for both toddlers and dogs.",5,1
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,This was a great product for the price but like some of the other posts the gate did not fit my doorway like it says it will. My doorway is in between 45-70 in. Luckily my husband just welded off one of the ends. Now it fits perfectly! So just beware if you buy this product it might not fit. It's a perfect gate for my kitchen doorway. I purchased it for my dogs & the door that opens works perfectly. Great for the price. Other gates run $80 and up.,4,1
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,This gate has taken a beating. We had to use stronger screws and fit it behind the door it was too large for our doorway. But other than that its perfect. keeps our two labs in there room. and our 18b month old out of the storage room,4,1
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,"Fits perfectly at both the top and bottom of our stairs.  Easy set up (did it myself without the husband in just a few minutes).  Haven't mounted it yet, but appears it will be very stable with the wall mounts.  Also does a good job of keeping my huge dog downstairs.",4,1
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,"I foster dogs and usually have four different dogs at one time (two resident dogs and two foster dogs).  It can take time to introduce new dogs the pack, and it can get to be a total mad house with 16 feet running all around the house when they are excited.  I had a large dog that needed to be kept separate from the smaller dogs, but we did so by keeping the pocket door shut.  This really  made the dog feel secluded, which she didn't deserve to feel.  I bought this gate and it fits in the pocket door grooves perfectly.  It allows the dogs to see each other, smell each other and feel more part of what is happening in the other room.  It is tall, which is exactly what I needed. I love the ease of the gate door and going in an out. It's become second nature and not a big deal at all. I think this gate would be fantastic with kids as well.  This gate indicates there is no need to drill holes in the wall, etc.  I do want to confirm that it is a pressure mounted gate. However, it does not perform as well when you are spreading the gate across too great of an area (meaning the pressure screws are screwed out a great deal). This weakens the stability of the gate.  It does come with four pieces you can screw into the wall for added stability.  While I have not used them yet, my experience with this gate for the past several months is that these items would likely work very, very well.  This gate feels strong and durable. My pitbull has been jumping against it for months.  It has kept her out.  It would definitely keep other dogs out, and toddlers.  I did have 8 week old husky puppies and one was able to shove herself between the bars of the gate. So, this gate would not keep out unwanted puppies, or other animals that small.  We loved this gate so much, we bought a second one.  I highly, highly recommend this gate.",5,1
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,"The gate is perfect for us, we do not use the extension in our doorway, but the gate is very tall and sturdy. Keeps our two crazy dogs at bay while we're at work.",5,1
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,This gate works very well keeping my dog in the kitchen.  Just perfect for the door opening.  I like it.,5,1
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,This gate is perfect for my needs. Well worth the money. Would definitely buy another one. Easy to setup and use.,5,1
"Chicco Cortina Keyfit 30 Travel System, Miro","We did A LOT of research to select what we thought was the safest car seat available. My husband, who has a 6 Sigma / technical background, insisted that we have the installation checked. When we asked the pros what they thought of the chicco car seat they said "" we aren't allowed to recommend one car seat over another, but we recently purchased a chicco for a expectant coworker."" That's all we needed to know.Now that I know what I'm doing, this car seat literally takes 30 seconds to install. The level on the side lets you know if the car seat is tilted correctly. Incredibly easy.We had one base installed using latch and one base installed using the seat belt.I wanted to comment on criticism that baby sweats in the car seat. This is true, but you'll find that with most infant car seats. I believe it's because of the material. Our baby has experienced numerous diaper blow-outs, and we were able to remove the cover and wash it (it drives much faster than I expected) without any stains or shrinkage.I've also heard people mention they can't imagine lugging a 30 pound baby around in a car seat. That's true. You probably wouldn't. However, it's really convenient if you're out and about and need a familiar place for baby to nap. I can't tell you the number of times we would put the baby in the car seat when at a friend's house so that she could take a nap. It gives you a little more freedom and flexibility, and it also keeps baby safe. Many of our friends have toddler-aged children who don't understand that you have to be careful around an infant. You'll probably also be thankful during winter because it's much easier to keep the baby warm (versus taking baby out of car seat and covering them up).As far as the stroller, I love it. The ride is very smooth and it handles really nicely. It is also the perfect size - not too big, not too small. Go to the store and ""test drive"" the other brands. Some seem like a good idea because they have lots of bells and whistles, but they are much bulkier (harder to maneuver if you're out and about - particularly if you're shopping in narrow aisles) and heavier. I find the chicco stroller easy to open/close. Keep in mind that it doesn't fold very compactly. If you have a very small trunk you may find that it takes up most of the space. If that's a problem, I highly recommend the City Elite with the adaptor bar.Some say the car seat and stroller are heavy, I say they're solid. They don't feel like they're going to fall apart. You wouldn't want your car seat to be made out of plastic, so why would you expect it to be as light as plastic?",5,1
"Chicco Liteway Stroller, Fuego","my son is 7 months old, fits perfect, reclines all the way back which was very important for me.it's a beautiful shade of red, comfy, stylish, easy to carry when closed, perfect for traveling.",4,1
"Chicco Liteway Stroller, Fuego","This is the perfect lightweight stroller!  I have a Phil and Ted's Vibe (which I love as well, regardless of the other reviews, it's been AWESOME!) as my main stroller, but we fly monthly and I wanted a lightweight stroller to maneuver airports and malls.My favorite features:Able to open and close with one hand (and a foot)The ""basket"" underneath can be removed and used as a backpackIt reclines ALL the way back, which is great for nap timeThere is a ""foot muff"" that comes up and wraps around an infant's feet and legs which was great for the crisp February Seattle weather when we were thereAnd the adjustable leg/foot rest is nice as well.The ONLY reason this didn't get a full five stars is I feel like the crotch strap is too short and needs to be adjustable.  I plan on using this well into toddler hood and I'm not sure the strap is going to work.  I may have to rip the seam and re-stich it in a different position.",4,1
"Chicco Liteway Stroller, Fuego","Short and to the point, we really like this and bought a 2nd.I'd say it's a good cheap alternative to the overpriced McLaren of similar (and better) design but it does the job.I see a lot of bad strollers out there and am thankful we have this one.  It's not perfect as other reviews will tell you but I have no major complains.  It is what it is, a simple, liteweight, umbrella stroller that is solid, not flimsy, and easy to fold and unfold.",5,1
"Thinkbaby Complete BPA Free Feeding Set, Orange, 6 Months","Tableware is of good quality, suitable for school-age children to use, Contains 5 pieces, which are very satisfied with the glass, stainless steel, plastic packaging, anti scald, afraid to fall,delivery speed, flawless and perfect goods packaging, worthy of trust and recommendation",5,1
"NoJo Jungle Tales Lenny the Lion, Gold",I ordered this as a decoration/gift for my niece for a baby shower that we are having for her. It is so cute and matches the new bedding perfectly!Very happy with the purchase,5,1
"Delta Canton 4-in-1 Convertible Crib, Dark Cherry","I absolutely love this crib! The cherry color is perfect! It still has a dark espresso color to it with a hint of red. It was super easy to put together and arrived in great shape! No scratches or dents of any kind! (We bought it on Walmart and had it shipped to store because I had read some reviews that said it was shipped poorly when shipped to home.)We also purchased the Delta Eclipse 6 Drawer Unit in Espresso Cherry to go with it. (I have included a link to it at the bottom of this review. The link goes to the Espresso drawer unit so be sure to select espresso cherry to match this crib.) I was worried that since it wasn't also called the ""Delta Canton"" version that the colors wouldn't match but they match perfectly! The dresser is of very high quality as well and I think it will last for many years!In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this product! The crib is beautiful and the price is outstanding! The crib looks just like the $500 cribs I have seen at stores but it only cost me $200! I would definitely recommend for any mother who wants something nice for their nursery without spending an outrageous amount of money!Delta Eclipse 6 Drawer Unit, Espresso",5,1
Graco Nasal Clear Nasal Aspirator,I wasn't to sure about this thing after reading some of the lower reviews but I was pleasantly surprised.  You definitely have to use this as the instructions say. Your little one needs to be in the upright position. My daughter hated the nose sucker and it was a constant battle. Now I can sit her on my lap and use this and she is perfectly still and calm!  I would also recommend using saline drops first to loosen up the mucous it seems to work even better this way!,4,1
Jolly Jumper Rocking Wooden Moses Stand - Cherry,"I almost skipped buying this stand, because of one review that said, that it is not campatible with Britax bassinet. So, I end up buying used one from a local ad, for almost the same price, because I wanted to make sure that it fits our bassinet and not to worry about returns. And it did fit perfectly. I think the customer didn't know that you can make a collapsible bassinet into a not collapsible.I didn't like the white plastic oval circle that holds bassinet from the sides, so I wrapped it with matching collor brown ribbon and it looked amazing. I want to mention that plastic part almost broke at the connection point while we were transportating home (you shouldn't carry the stand holding just the plastic part). However, it was not a problem, since my husband fixed it in 2 minutes and made it smaller and better fit for our bassinet.Our bed is low and the bassinet stand is just the right hight, which makes to reach the baby easy, almost like a coosleeper. Our baby is on the way, I hope she will like it.",4,1
Disney Cars Step Stool,"Adorable, lightweight, reasonably priced and perfect to assist my grandson to wash his own hands like a big boy!Will purchase again in a heart beat for another child.",5,1
Disney Cars Step Stool,"My son loves his &#34;vroom-vroom&#34; stool! :) we're working on potty training and this is perfect! he can climb on it himself and he moves it to the sink to brush his teeth or wash his hands, he feels like such a big boy now :)",5,1
"Pickles Nummy Animal Snuggly Banky, Blue Elephant, 16 X 16&quot;","My niece was going with an elephant theme for her baby boy so this was the perfect gift. That I could come up with.,The quality is good and it's cute but is smaller than I expected. I know the size is listed but the measurements seemed bigger in my brain when I read it. Guess most things are bigger in a guys brain. ;) Don't regret the purchase though.",4,1
"Pickles Nummy Animal Snuggly Banky, Blue Elephant, 16 X 16&quot;","My nieces both have had a Pickles animal since they were born so my sister got us one for my son when he was born. It is the best little nummy blankie out there in my opinion. Size is perfect- not too big not too small and the placement of the animal is perfect for holding and cuddling without excess material getting in the way. My baby loves to hold it, chew on it, and rub it by his face to fall asleep. It is so sweet!",5,1
JJ Cole Diaper and Wipes Pod - Black Dot,"My son is 19 months old now and I haven't used a diaper bag for him for a long time now; I just got tired of carrying a diaper bag with my purse.  This is perfect to hold a couple of diapers, some wipes, and a small changing pad.  The changing pad isn't big, granted, but I don't want a big one taking up all that space in my purse.  If you want a big, padded changing pad then carry a whole diaper bag!  This is just fine to put something under his bum while I'm changing him whether it's on the floor, a changing table, or in the back of the car.  The pod itself does have a small pocket on the back as well, which I find perfect for putting a few disposable bibs in for those times when we're out to eat and I haven't put a regular bib in my purse.  It works very well to keep everything together.  I'm also planning on using it as a diaper bag within a diaper bag when I have my second child in a few weeks.  The baby's stuff will be in the big bag, and my older son's stuff will be in this bag so that I can separate them easily when they are in different nurseries.  Overall, it's a great product and suits my needs.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it seems a little longer than it needs to be, but this may come in handy as his diapers get longer.  :)",4,1
Balboa Adjustable Sling Style in Dotted Daisy- Brown and White,"This sling is perfect! I wish I'd had it with my first child! I was torn between this sling and Hotslings, but after reading reviews and not wanting to deal with picking a sling size, I went with Balaboa. The strap is adjustable to make it as high or low as you want it to be. My son has loved it since he was a week old (22 inches, 8 pounds) and still loves it at 5 weeks. It is very comfortable to walk around in and I use it nearly everyday... to vacuum, do laundry, etc. We live in Japan, which is not stroller friendly, so this really has been a life saver. I've worn it nearly all day to the aquarium, park, grocery store, even to get my eyebrows waxed! Everyone I see raves about how cute and functional it is. Like the other review said, I've never worried about him falling out (and that's with me chasing after my toddler). We have a Baby Bjorn, which I used with my older son, but he never looked that comfortable in it.If you're having a baby, or know someone who is, this is the perfect purchase. Babies want to be held, but moms need their hands free! Lugging around a car seat or dealing with a big stroller isn't always practical or convenient. The price is a deal, too!",5,1
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Sleeping Bag, Star Light, Medium (Previous Model)","This is the second aden + anais sleep sac I have purchased for my son.  This is perfect for summertime sleeping.  The material is very soft and exactly what I would expect from aden + anais (I have several blankets of this fabric for my son as well).  It has withstood many a washing and continues to soften each time.  The lenth is also great for his size...no issues with binding his toes.  Only slightly disappointed in the zipper as it seems a little flimzy and cheap.  It would be great if they used a more robust zipper...especially for the price paid.  Otherwise, I love this sleep sac and plan to purchase another.",4,1
Playtex Baby Drop-Ins Premium Nurser Bottle Feeding Set,"I requested this product for one of my daughters because she told me she would be nursing after her son was born. I'm glad I did because she loved it, and I loved it, and it's the perfect thing for helping a new mom with nursing.First, the bottle nipples are similar to a mom's nipples. Although the baby will of course notice that it's not Mom, baby won't have a problem because these nipples are nice and small for a newborn's small mouth.Next, everything is disposable. You don't have to worry about getting home and having smelly bottles in the diaper bags. Just throw the inside liners away. The whole package is just super convenient for a new mom.My favorite thing was the little storage bottle you get. You can pump your milk and then put it in one of these containers until you're ready to use it. Makes it really easy when you're away from home and you want your baby to have breast milk.If you're a new mom, you'll definitely want this for your baby. It's a great starter set, and the bottles are top notch. If you know a mom who is nursing, and you want to give her a really great gift, I recommend this package. She will love it, and it will make feeding the baby easy when shen can't be there.",5,1

"Complete Deluxe Bi-fold Door Lock, 2 Pack","After trying to use sticky straps, hooks and eyes, and other child safety products to keep our bi-folds closed I finally broke down and ordered a set of these. I thought they would be flimsy and cheap but I was totally wrong. These are simple, awesome, perfect, easy....and awesome (again). Took about 10 seconds to install and we have had them on there for a good month now with no issues.",5,1
Safety 1st Lift Lock and Swing Gate,"The door is easily opened and closed with one hand, I installed with screws. My 9 month old baby boy is safe now from going to the laundry room. I need another door for top and bottom of the stairs but I am trying to avoid the use of screws on the walls. Still doing research, because I do not find this door stable for top of stairs, that is why I gave 4 stars, but if it is properly installed with screws it should work perfectly.",4,1

"Munchkin Mighty Grip Trainer Cup 2-Pack, 8 oz, Colors Vary","After damaging the spouts from vigorous cleanings with a bottle brush I realized the key to keeping this otherwise perfectly designed sippy cup from the trashcan is just to be gentle when you're cleaning it. Only use a soft sponge and do not force it too far up against the top of the spout. The spout works by having three slits in the silicon and if one of those fragile pieces tears, you will have leaks. Additionally, because there is no valve, if your child is accustomed to biting the spouts this design will cause more liquid to flow more easily which can be annoying to them or something fun to play with instead of drinking. For my daughter this was not an issue and she loves the soft feel of the top. They quickly became her favorite. I just wish they sold the soft tops separately so I could replace the ones I've damaged. Such is the cycle of production and consumption I suppose.",4,1
Bedtime Originals Hello Kitty and Puppy Fleece Blanket with Applique - Pink,"This was the perfect gift for our niece, a big Hello Kitty fan!  She loved it when she opened our gift and saw a nice, soft, blanket with the Hello Kitty logo on it!",5,1
Safety 1st Soft Spout Cover,"This spout cover is perfect! It does exactly what it needs to do: protects my toddler from bumping her head on the faucet, while being easy to clean without a lot of extra stuff (like a bubblebath dispenser) to get sticky.  And it is affordable so you can get one for the grandmothers too.",5,1
Safety 1st Soft Spout Cover,"Love this inexpensive item, perfect for covering our faucet head, lets the water come out without spraying all over the place like other covers we have purchased in the past. Buy this and you will not be disappointed!",5,1
Yookidoo Flow 'N Fill Spout Bath Toy (9m+),"I bought this toy for my 11-month old son. We don't bathe him in the ""big-boy"" tub yet, we use a plastic ""baby"" one - 1st-time mom, still a bit nervous about putting my little angel in a BIIIG tub : ).The Flow-n-Fill has 2 suction cups, doesn't fit perfectly in the plastic tub with slanted walls, but good enough to work.It sits a bit crooked, but that doesn't take anything away from the toy: My baby LOVES IT!!!! (I tried to see how it fits in a regular tub, and it fits perfectly!)He's excited every day about bath-time. He's 15 months now, and we've had NO PROBLEMS. He uses the little hoop to put other toys through it (balls & other bath toys). He stacks the little cups in every order he can think of - even if it doesn't fit properly - he enjoys it! At first, he was trying to grab the stream of water - so cute. He learned really fast how to turn the faucet on and off. He really loves it!My 5-year old nice wants to take a bath every time she visits, just to play with my son's bath toys. I'm buying one for her and her 2-yr old brother too.Great fun!!!Update 06/18/2012:My now 2 and a half year old son still plays with this toy every single night.A couple of suggestions:- clean the ""filter"", aka water intake area (the light blue part at the ""bottom"" of the toy, the part that has to be submerged in water for it to run) at least once every few months (6-9 months). Soap and other gunk from the tub water get in there, and really diminishes the water flow. It's pretty easy to do if you are handy with a small screwdriver.- change the batteries when the water starts coming our slower, or you get a ""thinner"" flow.- use with or without the cupsThis has truly been a toy that we've used every single day (evening) since we got it back in 2010. How many toys can you do that with???Back then I only paid about $15 for it. It was worth every penny and then some!",5,1
"Combi Cocorro Lightweight Convertible Car Seat, Cherry Pie","This seat is lovely for many reasons.  The cherry pie color is really beautiful and receives many compliments.  It fits perfectly behind the driver's seat in my teeny Subaru Impreza, even with my lanky husband at the wheel.  The seaming, etc. is well constructed - we have not had any wear and tear issues yet after three months of almost daily use.  Installation was not fun, but once we figured out the knack to tightening the strap we got it to fit perfectly with the LATCH system.  It also fits nicely in the fold-down backseat of my husband's Chevy Colorado, but I have to be driving because there is not enough room for him to move the seat back comfortably.  Since my son is so young, we are only rear facing at the moment - but I suspect the installation and fit will be just as good when we turn the seat around.My only big complaint has to do with the process of fastening the straps over the baby.  The buckle across the chest is no big deal.  However, there are two pieces of plastic that must fit together perfectly before you can clip them into the buckle between the legs.  The hand acrobatics required are not comfortable for me, and the pressure I have to put on baby's tummy sometimes is not comfortable for him either.  We have tried to loosen the straps, but the buckle is easy only when the straps are too loose.  Now that I am used to it, it's fine - but I spent the first few weeks of my son's life cursing at this car seat.  So if color, size, and quality are important to you, get this car seat for sure.  If you are not particularly endowed with manual dexterity, you may want to find something easier to operate.",4,1

Munchie Mug - Top Rated Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers. Ages 1 to 4 years. Made in AMERICA. - BPA and phthalate free. FDA compliant materials. - Blue Top,"I purchased this for our 11 month old. It took him a couple times using it to get it down, but now he loves that he can get his own cereal out of the container without it spilling all over. We bring it along to church and not only does it work great, it keeps him occupied for a few minutes which is a welcome break from the restlessness we deal with the rest of the time!Because it is a little loud when shaken with cereal in it, I put some cheap cotton fabric in it to line the sides and bottom of the container to muffle the cereal-shaking sound while in church. Now it is perfect, quiet for church, and very handy!",5,1
Munchie Mug - Top Rated Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers. Ages 1 to 4 years. Made in AMERICA. - BPA and phthalate free. FDA compliant materials. - Blue Top,We love the Muchie Mug! My son started using it when he was 11 months old and he loves it too. The wide handle is perfect for stumpy little fingers. We are also able to strap it on to the car seat and stroller using a Baby Buddy eliminating the need for us to play the pick up game. I have nothing but good things to say about this product!,5,1
Portable Mini Fridge,"My husband needed a small fridge to keep a couple of bottles of water cool in his room at work.This was the perfect solution for him.It has 2 separate plugs, 1-AC and 1-DC for use in home or in a vehicle.Great alternative to a big fridge is all you need it for is just a fewdrinks!",5,1
"Beansprout Hopper Frog Valance, Blue/Green","Matched perfectly, exactly as described! Fast shipping, easy ordering process. Would buy item over and over again if I needed more!",5,1
Milkies Milk-Saver Breast Milk Collector Storage BPA Free,"it is large, so that it can hold the amount of milk you're leaking. remove the removable hard plastic inner part to make it more soft and pliable. i definitely leaked more when i was in my second and third week. in fifth week now and i got a half an ounce yesterday but at least milk wasn't all over my clothes. PERFECT for when you will want to add some milk to cereal, or for mixing with meds. the ideal product would be a closed bag that you could lay in and it would suction somehow to your nipple, but that doesn't exist. someone out there patent it and give me a cut",5,1
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Sleeping bag, Butterflies, Large","I wish I could sleep in one of these! I'd love one of their blankets for me, as this fabric is so buttery soft! This sleep sack fits great on my baby, plenty of grow room at 13 months old. Perfect weight to keep baby comfy in the Summertime with just a onesie on underneath. And they just get softer with each wash. Love!",5,1

The Nesting Pillow - Organic Nursing Pillow with Washable Slip Cover,"This is my favorite baby item. I couldn't live without it for baby! Unlike the Boppy, it's filled with buckwheat, so it's very malleable and warm for baby. It has been the perfect nursing companion, as well as napping companion, for myself and baby. I can sit on the bed and put the pillow on my lap, and it's very comfortable for both of us to nurse (and has been for four months now). When baby fell asleep nursing when he was very little, it was easy to transfer him from pillow to crib. Now it's a great support while napping, and has been doubling as a laptop lap pad when I get to work from home. The slipcover comes off easily and washes easily, and it's all organic, so I feel good about baby spending lots of time on it. Love this pillow--worth the high price tag!",5,1
"Lansinoh Double Electric Breast Pump, BPA-free","I work full time (returned after 10 weeks) and needed a pump so i could keep feeding my baby.  This one has worked great.  I've never had a problem with it, no pain and my supply has been great.  I pump 2x's a day and have enough to feed my daughter the next day.  I like that its not bulky and heavy, its easy to use and i only have to wash a couple parts each time.  Any small top bottle screws on it, which is also a plus.  For my limited budget, this was perfect.  Also, I was told by my lactation consultant that its the same exact thing as an Ameda Purely Yours, just different marketing and branding, and cheaper.  She also said only to get a Medela, Ameda, or Lanisoh pump as all the other ones are made by formula companies and don't work as well on purpose.  Great product and would suggest to any friends.",5,1
"Lansinoh Double Electric Breast Pump, BPA-free","I am living in Germany because my husband is stationed here. I had my baby in a German hospital and after failing breastfeeding (he had jaundice and it was so much work he wouldn't latch because he would get so tired and frustrated) I began pumping because I wanted him to have breastmilk....however possible. It was awful, the hospital had the really fancy medela pumps and I would pump and nothing would come out! Literally I sat for 40 mins and I got 5 ml out of BOTH breasts. I was so frustrated and almost completely gave up. I had bought this pump so I could freeze extra breast milk, so my husband reassured me and brought the pump to the hospital. (Batteries work great I know because the outlets here are different) I used this pump and the milk was flowing out! I don't know what the difference was, but this pumped worked for me when the medela didn't. A perfect case where you don't always get what you pay for because the medela is soooo expensive compared to this product. Also, their breast milk storage bags are a MUST!!!",5,1
Cradle Mattress - Size 18 X 36,This item arrived earlier than promised and was perfect for the cradle that my husband made for our new grand daughter. Very pleased with the quality and the price was definitely good.,5,1
"Britax Advocate 65 CS Click &amp; Safe Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","If you have a small car forget it. We have a 04 Toyota Sienna and putting this seat rearward facing for our under 1 year baby, makes it so that we can't get in the van from the left side. I had originally set it up to be on the right - but we couldn't get in and out of the van. WOW. The seat has these cushy ""wings"" that stick out ( you can see them in picture) and provide some additional side impact protection.The chair is really impressive with the material and all the little things that really say "" I am a safe baby seat"".It is pretty easy to adjust, and can grow with your little ones - up to 65 lbs.It is not easy to install simply because of its sheer size, and the plate on the bottom is a bit hard to sit perfectly in the seat. If that makes sense. The latch system works great (as it does in other car seats).You just have to be prepared to loose a great deal of space and functionality of your automobile when you install this seat. If you have a small car - do not buy this car seat - it simply will block your entire view and it may not fit. If you have a small car and need to sit it up rear facing - forget it.I imagine we have moved into the range of where we place our kids into a small protective completely shielded airbag and we won't be able to see them until we reach our destination .... we have entered a car seat arms race!",5,1
bumGenius Elemental One-Size Diaper - White,"No leaks, no rash,  holds in the biggest messes. Never had a blowout.  So much better than microfiber!!! Very absorbent w/o bulk.  Totally worth every penny.  Take a long time to dry, a bit awkward on a newborn folding the inside but once in the medium rise setting the fit is really perfect.  They work for a newborn though for sure.  We sun if there is stain and they look new again. Highly recommend this diaper over the bg 4.0 I just sold all 18 of my 4.0 and bought more of these.  I was worried about wanting a stay dry fabric.  Now after CD for 7 mos that we only need stay dry fabric at night and you can lay a thin piece of fleece in them if desired. Cotton does not get stinky like microfiber and the convenience of not stuffing or unstuffing is really nice.  Love these over the new bg freetime as well I prefer the elemental the quality is so much better with organic cotton.",5,1
"North American Bear security baby cozies blanket (One size: 8 1/2&quot;, Cream &amp; Blue Puppy)","Our 3-year-old grandson is a rough and tumble type, but he loves carrying around a stuffed animal. Since those are not washable, I thought of this as an alternative. He picked out his favorites, the lion and the black and white dog, and I purchased both. He loves them, and now he can carry them with him everywhere, and his mom can always toss them in the washing machine after they have been around the house and outside a few times.These are so soft, too! They were smaller than I was expecting, but that turned out to be a good thing. They are easier for our grandson to tote around or toss in the air, and they are not so babyish that he might not want to be seen with them by his older brothers. They are as soft as a lovey, but look like toys. They are perfect! I almost want one for myself. :-)",5,1
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Mobile, Rock N Roll","Although my little great grandson has not arrived yet, I'm sure he will love it.  My granddaughter loves it and everything I bought for the crib matches perfect.  Everything met my expectations.",5,1
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,"This would be perfect if it was just a couple inches longer.  My changing table has the pad inset, so that a properly fit pad would take up the whole inset space.  Otherwise, I can't complain for the money and the quality.",4,1
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,This product works well. The curved design makes diaper changing much safer and more comfortable.  Fits changing table perfectly. Bought cover to go with it so I can just put it in washer.,5,1
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,"Great Quality, Great Style.  I haven't gotten to use this yet because I still have 7 days until my newborn but so far I love it.  It sets on my dresser perfectly and all the covers I've boughten for it fits great.",5,1
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,Great value!  Same quality as the $30 changing pad I purchased 4 years ago for half the price!  Changing pad covers fit perfectly.,5,1
"Safety 1st Deluxe Sit, Snack and Go Booster","This chair is perfect to take to the grandparents, picnic, camping... Although this is not good for a primary high chair for home by a long shot.  I read the other reviews and I was very surprised!  My 21 month old son who is average height and weight fits in just fine with plenty of room for growth.  I do understand the middle strap being poorly designed but I didn't find it to be that much of an issue.  As they grow, you can take the back and sides off and use it as a booster seat with no straps.  I also love that the tray is hard to get off because my son has figured out how to get the tray off on the one at home; which means food all over the floor and that will NOT fly at the grandparents.I used this all summer at bbqs, family reunion, camping...  I also bring this in with me at restaurants because I KNOW how clean it is.It folds up and down very easily and it's small enough that I don't even notice it in my trunk. It is also very lightweight so it's never a hassle.",5,1
Baby Einstein Bendy Ball,It's my little one first toy. I love how he can hold it easily and look at it with his big eyes. It was perfect for my baby. Great Christmas present.,5,1
Baby Einstein Bendy Ball,"My 5 month old loves this little toy, I highly recommend it!  It is smaller than I thought it was going to be from the picture, but it is the perfect size for tiny hands.  It is sort of a soft type of plastic, which is great for little ones who put everything in their mouths.  Also, it has a little ball that tumbles around inside, with a bell that tinkles inside of that.  I give it five stars.",5,1
"J.L. Childress Side Sling Stroller Cargo Net, Black",It works perfectly. Not too wide. I would get another if I needed to. Would recommend to anyone with a stroller.,5,1
Soothing Star Teether,I bought this for my nephew and he loved it. It is a great price and is perfect as far as durability is concerned. He chewed on this thing for a long time as it does help with the teething process as well as it being fun because of all the colors. I would reccomend this product to everyone.,5,1
Elevated Changing Station,"I purchased this changing pad not because it's elevated but because it's short and fits on my changing table.  Not everybody buys an actual changing table that fits the ""normal"" sized changing pads and this changing pad is perfect for smaller areas.  It's an additional benefit that it is elevated, but I am very happy with this product.  The only improvement I can think of would be adding straps to help keep baby safer during changings.  Other than that, it's a good product!",4,1
Dream On Me 88 Coil Inner Spring Crib and Toddler Mattress,My baby loves to sleep on this. He has a hard time sleeping anywhere else. It fit perfectly in the crib no gaps. He can sleep almost 12 hours at night on this mattress.,5,1

Ashley 24 Month Christening Gowns for Girls. Made in the USA,Just like other reviews I am glad I spent the extra money to buy this gown. It is beautiful. Very well made. I will say my 8 month old weighs about 20lb and is in the 100% for height and weight so the 18-24 month gown fit perfect.,5,1
Ashley 24 Month Christening Gowns for Girls. Made in the USA,"My daughter, 3 months old at the time of her christening, looked absolutely beautiful in it. The dress is perfect, exactly as pictured. It's very classic, simple and elegant. It is easily an heirloom gown that I will hold onto so that she may pass it on to her. It arrived fast, in excellent condition. I'm so happy with my purchase. You will not be sorry if you order this gown!",5,1

Puma Baby Solid Gripper Socks- 3 Pack(Infant to Baby) (12-24 months),"My 10 month old crawls, pulls-up and pulls on his socks all day long providing many opportunities to lose a sock or two.  So, I've been searching for a sock that can stay on my baby's feet throughout the day. These socks stay on all day.  Another surprising benefit of these Puma socks: they are easier to slip on as the fabric is not clingy and the elastic is not too tight. This is handy when he's kicking and squirming in the morning.  The grip is just enough that he climbs our wooden stairs and stands in place without slipping.  They have held their shape after several washings now.  I think I have found the perfect sock for my baby.",5,1
Versatile Play Pen - Large (16 pieces),"I ordered this for my in-home daycare. I care for 3 infants and realized as they each began to crawl, I would need something to help keep them safe and allow a place for them to crawl and play.  This play pen is PERFECT for our us! This is the BEST $300 I have ever spent! I have it set up right in our main living room.One of my daycare moms actually purchased one as well after seeing mine and how great it is for the babies. They have plenty of space and it is bright and colorful for them.I have nothing negative to say about this play pen, other than I wish I would have had one it when my 4 kids were little!",5,1
Svan Chair Cushion in Balloons Pink,"Fits the fabulous Svan chair perfectly of course, and fun and cute without being cutesie. The pattern means food spills won't show up as obviously as on a solid color cushion.We have a poop blowout the first time baby was in the chair, and had stains on both cushions. I stain-treated the spots, washed and hoped for the best, and the cushions are like new, no trace of a stain. What every mother would wish for!",5,1

"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","This bath spout cover is probably the cutest one that I have found out there.  It works great but pay attention to your spout.  Ours is in the front and the ""blow hole"" on this product is on top so it doesn't fit our spout exactly.  It still works and I am going to keep it, but it is a little annoying that I have to maneuver under it to hit the spout.  Overall it's a great product if it fit perfectly.",4,1
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby",Goes on easy. Fits perfect. It's cute and it makes bathtime safer. What more can I say. It's a great product.,5,1
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","Great for the tub!  Keeps baby safe and fits on spout perfectly.  Easy to take on and off, pretty cute too!",5,1
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","Giving baths to the little ones can sometimes be stressful, especially when they try to throw their little sensitive noggins at the metal spout. This cover not only makes that way safer, but the kids like to play with it. It makes it fun to see the water come out.It fits perfectly on our spout too, which is great.",5,1
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby",I love the tight fit of this spout cover.  The little duck wings pull out from the sides to tighten the cover onto the faucet.  This protects well from bumps from the front of the faucet but I'm not sure how much coverage it provides from my baby banging her head on the bottom of the faucet from underneath.  Obviously the water needs to come through somewhere though!  It is cute and matches our ducky rubber bath mat perfectly.,5,1
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","I read so many reviews on so many of these things.  This one had the most 5 star ratings, and the least 1 star ratings so I ordered it.  Very happy I trusted the ratings.  The tub faucet we have has the nob to pull up for the shower and is one that has the wide mouth and kind of curves in.  Not a standard tub faucet and this fit on there perfectly.  The nob can still be pulled up easily and it is secure on the facet as well.  Very glad I went with this one!",5,1
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby",I've used this since my daughter was born. First we used it on the spout of the sink when she was an infant and we gave her baths in the sink. This will only work on certain types of sink faucets and it isn't totally secure but protects baby and at that age she wasn't grabbing at it any way. Now that my daughter is older we use this in the bath where it is originally intended for. The cover is a soft bending plastic that is easy to fit over the spout. The whale fins help secure the cover onto the spout. Keeps baby from hurting themselves and the tail is the perfect size to hang over the safety handle on the side of the tub. This is a GREAT price for this product. Other whale covers at the store are made of hard plastic and cost more.,5,1
"NUK 2 Pack Classic Silicone BPA Free Fashion Pacifier, Size 2, Colors May Vary",Perfect like always! I am a returning customer.... I have bought about 40 of these things. My daughter goes through them a lot. She is sick and tends to chew this when her stress levels are high. So new on is brought out every other day or so.,5,1
Rainbow (5 Colors) Interlocking foam Wonder Mats: 36 Pieces at 12&quot; X 12&quot; X ~9/16&quot; Extra Thick,"I purchased 36sqft (36 of the 1'x1' tiles) and this created the perfect space for my daughter when paired with the North State play yard (with 2-piece extender). As a parent, I was able to give my child her own space to crawl, explore and yes, fall down, without worrying about injury. My daughter's first steps were taken on this mat and I can't tell you how many times she has fallen on this mat while learning to walk or play. She has never cried from the falls and I can attest that the foam is very comfortable and protective.It is also important to point out that these tiles DON'T SMELL! Many cheaper quality foam mats have a horrid smell (usually from volatile chemicals off-gassing). Brand new, these tiles had a faint smell from the plastic packaging but it went away after a couple of days. When compared to tiles from other expensive stores (Buy Buy Baby or Pottery Barn Kids), those tiles made me want to heave after being exposed to their odor.Cleanup is pretty easy on the tiles. If there are too many juice/milk spills, gather up the tiles and wipe down with mild soap or all-purpose cleaners and let air dry. At one point, my daughter had spilled so much juice on these tiles it essentially glued the tiles to my hardwood floor. After a few minutes of carefully 'tearing' the tiles and floor apart, I was surprised that the tiles didn't sustain any damage from this process! A quick trip to the sink with hot water and dish soap later and they were back in action.How satisfied am I with these tiles? I just purchased another 48sqft of tiles to create another play area for my second child. There is no better tile on the market.",5,1
"Little Bamboo Viscose Swaddling Muslin Wrap, 3 Pack","These muslin wraps and soft and large, perfect for baby. They get softer with each wash.  I used them with my summer baby into the fall, when he decided he no longer liked to be swaddled, but continued to use them in his bassinet in crib as a light weight cover by tucking in a the sides and foot of the crib until he started to move to much.  I would purchase again.",5,1
"Trend Lab CribWrap Fleece Rail Cover for Long Rail, Brown, Wide",Keeps baby and crib safe! The color is perfect because it blends in with the crib. It's soft and easy to put on - although there are a lot of little ties :) but I suppose he would get it off if there wasn't!,5,1
"Trend Lab CribWrap Fleece Rail Cover for Long Rail, Brown, Wide","These fit our sleigh crib perfectly and we love them! They have protected my daughter's crib from scratches and bite marks.

"Trend Lab Fleece CribWrap Rail Covers for Crib Sides (Set of 2), Brown, Wide","We have a sleigh crib and this fit it perfectly and kept my daughter from ruining the wood of her crib.

These are a must have!",5,1
"Trend Lab Fleece CribWrap Rail Covers for Crib Sides (Set of 2), Pink, Wide","As soon as my daughter started to gnaw on her crib rails, I started the search for crib rail guards.  I was torn between these and the rubberized kind.  After reading other reviews I went with these, and am so glad that I did! They fit the crib perfectly and are so soft!  Now my daughter nuzzles her face on them rather than trying to chew the rails!! The one downside is that there is a lot of tying involved to get them on...but not worth a bad review!",4,1
Trend Lab Versailles Pink and White Window Valance,Arrived on time and in great condition.  The color is perfect and I love how it looks in the room.  It was exactly like the online picture and the color ""PINK"" I have been looking for.  I would recommend this to my friends. I am VERY happy with my purchase!,5,1

I also bought a set of Gerber prefolds which are not NEARLY as soft.",5,1
Boppy Happy Place Playard,"We registered for this to use as a bassinet in our room, as well as a playard. I love the bassinet incline for reflux, and the matress was the best I found in any playard. We haven't used the music yet, or the changer but most likely will when we travel. It is adorable and very well made! Very modern/stylish looking. Not your typical baby prints. We also purchased the boppy swing which matches perfectly! I have recieved many compliments on this set! The directions were very clear, and set up is a cinch. We also did not have a problem finding sheets that fit. I had read reviews on another site stating that a few people had an issue with that, so we had a Babies R Us store associate help us find several sheets(Like the Koala Baby 2 Pack Portable Crib Sheets.) that were the right size. Overall we love this!",5,1

"Graco Lauren Classic Crib, Espresso","We ordered this crib along with the matching Changing table after talking a look at this crib @ a store. I was lil' concerned about the height of mattress as i'm only 5.2'. But, this one looks comfortable for lifting the baby. yet to try with the baby though.. :-) (I've seen reviews where people've told this is good for petite moms).The items arrived in just 3 days since we placed the order since I've enrolled in Amazon Mom (Enrolling in Amazon mom gives you few months of Amazon Prime's shipping features... chk out the site for more details). Eeverything was so perfect in the package. We had ordered Walnut color to match with our bed room furniture and the crib color matched as we expected. It's almost a brown colored one...Assembling this is so simple.My husband did that in 30-40 minutes by himself... One thing to note is that package is so heavy and not easy to lift by one person. We are staying in 3rd floor of an Apt and we had tough time carrying it to our Apt from the Apartment Office. Would've been easier if one of us had stayed home to receive this or having a truck would've helped...I'm giving 4 ratings because I've not started using the crib yet... I hope I've time to revisit this and update the review once I start using this one for my LO... :-)",4,1
"Graco Lauren Classic Crib, Espresso","I researched tons of cribs before I decided what to get.  We ordered a DaVinci crib for our house for my older son when he was born in 2010 and got this one for my mom to have at her house for him because it seemed perfect and was half the price.  We've been very happy with both cribs... in fact we're having another baby next month and ordered the Lauren crib for our house for this baby.  It just seemed like a better deal then spending $300 on another crib.  The only disappointing thing when comparing the two is that this crib doesn't have as many height adjustments so the highest level is still somewhat low.  Not a big deal, since when you drop it all the way down it's still very safe... but it was nice to have a really high mattress for those first few months so that I didn't have to bend over so far.  It's a little thing and not worth an extra $150 for me.",5,1
"Graco Lauren Classic Crib, Espresso",The crib was a purchase for my 10 month old granddaughter who had outgrown her mini crib. The crib is sturdy and my daughter had it assembled in about 20 minutes. The crib came a day earlier then we expected. It is a wonderful crib and the price was perfect.,5,1
"Graco Lauren Classic Crib, Espresso",I ordered this crib for my son. I LOVE LOVE this crib. It is perfect. Well built & very nice. Looks great in the nursery. Would recommend!,5,1
A Pair And A Spare Chenille Pink Elephant Security Blanket,"We had this given as a gift for our daughter, and it works great. She has used it to put herself to sleep since she was a couple months old. She is 3 now and we finally decided to replace the set. with new ones.(they are still fine but a bit faded.)Having 3 is perfect for us, we keep 1 at her daycare and 1 at home, and 1 spare. The actual blankets are soft and are great for little hands.We loved this so much we bought a green triceratops one for our son. Good buy.",5,1
Dolce Mia Firefighter Birthday Party Invitations Party Pack - 8 cards,"No complaints, came on time, good quality - perfect for my son's fireman birthday party. I would recommend it to others.",5,1
"Nursery Parade Picture Frame, Silver","Beautiful frame, perfect shower gift, to help fill a gift bag for an expecting mom, which is one of the reasons I bought this along with a few other items. Its just so pretty, and there were no problems at all with packaging.",5,1
"Carter's Pink Elephant Diaper Stacker, Pink/Choc, 26 X 12.5&quot;","I bought the whole set, love the design, the color and the quality. it matches perfectly the rest of the nursery.Would definitely recommend it.",5,1
"Carter's Green Elephant Canvas Wall Art-1 Piece 12&quot; X 21&quot;, Green/Choc, 12 X 12&quot;","Although I was hoping to find a wall piece that was much bigger, this canvas wall decor is the perfect accent to the Carter's Green/Chocolate Elephant crib set. The brown on the canvas seems easy to rub off if scratched, so be careful when opening. Other than that, I love it.",4,1
Norwall LW79151 WallBorder,I got this product in the mail in no time and it was as described and in perfect condition! no holes and wasn't torn. its super cute and easy to apply. overall a great buy,5,1
"Kalencom Ozz Iridescent New Flap Bag, Red","I have to say I LOVE LOVE LOVE this bag... so adorn, just love it.  So girly and perfect.  I'm half Korean and some of the art actually reminds me of a game my mom and grandfather would play.. I think its called &#34;hauto.&#34;  Anyway, its even got asian characters on there which I didnt notice in the picture, so it's definitely asian-inspired and i just love love love love love it!  like that it comes with the extra lil pouch too for lotions and whatnot.",5,1
"Maclaren Universal Organizer, Twin- Black","I don't have a maclaren I have a graco and it works great. At first I was scared to purchase because my stroller is slightly wider than the maclarens, but it fit great. It keeps my drink and the kids drinks upright. The side cup holders are a little small so they won't hold a large cup but they hold the kids cups and water bottles just perfect. Plus the middle part will hold bigger cups or additional cups and so far it has kept those upright also. I keep my cell and devotional there along with snacks. Then I still have room in the mesh part. Although I don't use the mesh part as much. That part has a Velcro closure on it. Overall great product!!",5,1
"Nuby Paci Cradle Pacifier Box, Colors may vary","Handle is split in such a way you can place it over a handle (say that to your infant carrier or stroller), my baby uses Soothies gel pacifiers and placed in correctly, each case will fit two of them (perfect for when she inevitably drops onto the dirty ground and I'm not near a place to wash it, I have a back up without the worry of having it floating around in the diaper bag, wife's purse, etc. where it would also get dirty)",5,1
"Nuby 2 Pack Embossed Section Plate, Colors May Vary","Almost perfect - love everything about these plates, however they don't stack. That is the only downside - otherwise they are durable (not only do they stand up to baby throwing them on the floor! also seems to be doing just fine going through the dishwasher on the top rack). I had gotten some other toddler plates on Amazon and the plate shattered when baby threw it on the floor the first time :(  These plates here are much more durable.  Also, I like that these plates are colorful.",4,1
WubbaNub Brown Bear,"These are the PERFECT baby shower add on gift.  My son is by no means fussy but this little buddy is his favorite car seat companion for the traffic ridden commute to daycare.  The nook is attached to the little animal making it easy for the lil ones to grab hold in the early days when the fine, hand to nook skills are a little lacking.  And if that wasn't enough reason, they are washing machine safe.  Highly recommend!",5,1
WubbaNub Brown Bear,"I was expecting a slightly larger animal, however considering it is for an infant it is the perfect size. Basically this was for a baby shower gift. I took it out of the original packaging and repackaged it because I didn't like the original labeling. Lame I know, but as a designer I wanted it to look more original and cool. But, that doesn't affect the wubbanub item. As I said, it wasn't for me, but for some one else, therefore I can't comment on the effectiveness of the item.",4,1
"Baby Cubes 2 Oz. Baby Food Storage Contains no Phthalates, Bisphenol-A, PVC (2 Pack)","These containers have worked out perfectly for my baby's homemade organic food.  They stack well, wash well and the tops close tight.  Ordered the 2 oz originally and then went online again to order the 4 oz containers as well!  A great buy in my opinion.",5,1
"Baby Cubes Baby Food Storage Contains no Phthalates, Bisphenol-A, PVC 2 Pack","I tried ice cube trays and nursing tubes.  I found this to be one of the best ways to store and reheat baby food.  It snaps tightly, stacks perfectly and stores neatly in my freezer.  I set it in the fridge the night before and microwave the food directly in the container, with the list open for ventilation.",5,1
"Baby Cubes 1 Oz. Baby Food Storage Contains no Phthalates, Bisphenol-A, PVC (2 Pack) 20 Cubes","This is a PBA AND PVC free plastic which is a must and the perfect size and good quality and dishwasher safe.  My only tip is that it has a fill line your not supposed to fill past.  I know now since I didn't listen that when the food freezes it expands so if you go past the fill line the lid will pop open.  So, don't fill past the line and these containers rock!",5,1
Contours Classique 3-in-1 Bassinet,"My parents purchased the Bassinet for us as a baby gift off our registry.  When we first unpacked it I was a bit skeptic as there seemed to be a lot of plastic parts and I was unsure who well they would hold up once everything was all put together.  As my husband was putting it together he kept making comments on how easy it was and how much he loved it!  It's now sitting in the baby's nursery waiting to be used.  We just love the convenience of it and the ability to easily switch it to a changing table.  The colors are perfect and match the other decor we have.  The baskets are also very convenient to have as extra little storage.  The only thing I would have to complain about is the mattress pad. We definitely had to purchase a seperate one as the one that was provided was a bit flimsy.  Mattress pads are pretty cheap though, so this was not a problem for us.",4,1
GEENNY Musical Mobile For Pink Brown Star &amp; Moon CRIB BEDDING SET,The mobile is so adorable!! It matches everything perfectly and is so cute and girly!! I absolutely love itso much!!!,5,1
Geenny CF-2031-L Butterfly Lamp Shade,I have this lamp with Geenny Musical Mobile For Boutique Lavender Butterfly CRIB BEDDING SET and the Baby Nursery Set. The lamp is cute and it matches everything perfectly.,5,1
Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray - Orange,"The Beaba tray is great so far! I made cherry puree and froze it in the tray. When they were ready, they easily slid out of the tray. The cover is nice because it protects the food from other freezer smells and other things that might fall on your purees. The color is really stylish - - if that's something that's important to you. And, the size of each capsule is just about perfect for a meal or a day's worth of meals if your little one is very little.",5,1
Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray - Orange,I have two.  I like this product for a few reasons and dislike it for only one reason.  This is a good product because it gives you perfect 2oz portions.  It is easy to clean and store and fit in the freezer.  The only down side is that the plastic scent is a bit strong and sometimes the food scent stays on it even after I wash it in the dishwasher.  Maybe it is because I do not take them out once they freeze and place them in ziplock bags.  I just leave the food in and take 1 or 2 out at a time.  I still make and store my little one her apple sauce even though she is a finger food baby and not a puree baby anymore.  I still use this product and recommend it.,4,1
Satsuma Designs Jersey Swaddling Blanket - Natural,I love this blanket both for my son and as a gift.  It's super soft and perfect for swaddling baby and later as a cover up.  Highly recommend!,5,1
Delta Play Time Jungle Rocking Bassinet,"This bassinet with the versatile jungle print is very durable and the jungle print is veratile.  It was used for my grandson, a family friend's daughter, and is still in perfect condition awaiting my daughter's second child.",5,1
NoJo Emily Wall Decals,"So we purchased the bedding set for our daughter, and felt like the wall could use a few decorations.  These are a nice more than matte finish.  They look very nice, however when we applied them to our satin painted wall they did not stick very well.  After we purchased some wall paper paste they worked perfectly...  Very happy with them, but just an F.Y.I. you might need some roll on wall paper paste.",4,1
Green Camo Fitted Crib Sheet for Baby and Toddler Bedding Sets by Sweet Jojo Designs - Camo Print,Just a perfect fit and great to touch and washes just fine. No issuesnas far as gadding like some have mentioned,5,1
Funky Zebra Window Treatment Panels by Sweet Jojo Designs - Set of 2,Happy with our purchase these are better quality than expected. The color is a bright pink and perfect addition to daughter's room.,5,1
WubbaNub Tabby Kitten,These are so adorable I've purchased many in the past. They are sturdy and if they get dirty I just hand wash them and them they dry fast.  Ive even thrown in the dryer with cloths and no dryer sheets for a couple of minutes and its perfect. I always rinse the binkie part again just to be sure it's ok. The pacifier is a soothie one just like the one you get in the hospital I love it and I always give these to friends as a gift with regular soothie pacifiers.,5,1
WubbaNub Tabby Kitten,"I guess I should say my baby son loved WubbaNubs, lol. These are truly genius!!! Perfect for little babies that loose their pacifiers all the time; these are easy to find for you and them. My son really liked holding onto the animal too as a comfort thing! I highly recommend these!",5,1
Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier - Monkey,Got this one as a present for my sister in law but my son had them when he was tiny.  They are the perfect size to fit in their hands and hold in their mouth and adorable.  I only wish you could replace the pacifier - we had a dog who liked to chew them!,5,1
Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier - Monkey,"My 4 month old loves her little monkey. She doesn't use it as a pacifier very often, but she loves the monkey. The monkey is the perfect size for her hand and she likes to swing it around. Later when she needs a little soothing, she will grab it by the head and put the the pacifier part in her own mouth. It gives her independence.It is also easy to clean. I simply use a bottle brush to wash the nipple and then pop it into our sterilizer. I then leave it on the bottle rack for 30 minutes and it's dry.",4,1
"Gerber Brand 3 Pack Knit Burpcloth, Neutral 2009","I have four kids and just discovered these burp cloths. My baby is 2 months old and she is my second ""spitter.""  I had a favorite before these, but these are so much better.  They are soft on baby's skin, lightweight so I don't feel like I""m wearing a diaper on my shoulder, and most importantly, absorbent.  Since my baby spits up so much, I don't expect to use one burp cloth for the whole day.  It lasts 2-3 feedings and then launders perfectly.  Some burp cloths are easy to maneuver on the shoulder, but only last one feeding.  Others are actually huge diapers and would last all day, but be totally gross and stinky.  This one is a perfect middle ground.",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Gentle Waves Musical Mobile,I really enjoy the ocean music and classical music. They help my baby sleep.  It matches the nursery perfect. Great price,4,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Kick and Play Piano,"My Princess loves kicking! When I received it I opened it immediately. The batteries that was there were drained...no biggie. When she kicked it and saw the lights and music playing, she went on a kicking spree. She was so amused! She kicked herself to sleep. The music is not loud which is perfect for me. It is loud enough for her to hear and the room she is in. Noise makers drives me crazy so I was concerned. But this is perfect. If you are looking for so loud that your baby does not fall asleep then this toy is not for you.",5,1
Boutique Brand New GEENNY Baby Boy Artist 13PCS CRIB BEDDING SET,The colors are perfect and my sister loved it for her baby boy. Its a great buy for a boy or girl.,5,1
"Gerber 4 in 1 Diaper Bag, Brown","I've been using the diaper bag for 7 month now and is recomendable since it fits everything I need, and the accesories come in handy, specially the changer.The pockets on the sides are perfect for baby bottles, and the compartments have been very useful for different things a baby needs.",4,1
"Carter's Forest Friends Throw Pillow, Tan/Choc, 12&quot; X 12&quot; X 3&quot;",This pillow was just what we needed to bring our nursery together I love the cute owl and the soft fabrics used. It sits on the glider and is perfect for placing behind your back and offers great support.,5,1
"Carter's Forest Friends Throw Pillow, Tan/Choc, 12&quot; X 12&quot; X 3&quot;",I decorated my 6yr old daughters room with owls and I love this pillow! It is a perfect throw pillow for her bed.,5,1
"Nuby 2 Pack Ortho Softflex Pacifier, 6 Months, Colors May Vary","We used Nuk orthodontic solid piece silicone pacifiers until he outgrew them around 5-6 months. I loved that they were one piece (easier to clean), silicone, and orthodontic. I went on a pacifier hunt for several months until I finally found these! These are the almost-perfect replacements. All other pacifiers in our house have been tossed.Here's what we like:- The nipple has an orthodontic shape that my son doesn't spit out (which to me means it's a good fit). It also has a bit of give so the nipple can be sucked in a little harder if wanted; occasionally my son will play with that feature. I assume it simulates the flex of mom's nipple. Also, the narrow part of the nipple (between the lips/gums) is slightly textured. This also helps the pacifier stay in baby's mouth.- Although these pacifiers are not one solid piece, the silicone part is very wide and covers the whole mouth area. If you've ever used a pacifier where the mouthpiece connects directly to the plastic shield, you've likely seen just how nasty they can get at the connecting area- where you can't clean it!- The solid vertical 'bar' on the shield is great. It doesn't stick out so far that it gets knocked out, yet it's easy for my son to grab it to pull it out and put it back in. You can also use a pacifier holder there (like the BooginHead PaciGrip).- The mouth shield has just enough dip under the nose and curve to the cheeks to fit nicely without digging in anywhere. My son has big cheeks and some pacifiers dig in on the sides; this one doesn't.Ultimately any pacifier that stays in and can be thoroughly cleaned is a huge WIN! in my book. My son is 12 months and the 6+ months size is still great for him. It probably would've been a little too big right at the 6 month mark but babies grow fast.The negative reviews here are due to the ""colors may vary"" lack of color choice- not due to the pacifier itself. Yes I wish amazon let us choose- but sometimes you just don't have that option, and you as a consumer take a chance that you may not love the colors. Deal with it!! We've bought 5 packs over a couple of months and received: 3 red/blue, 1 green/teal, and 1 pink/purple. I'll likely save the pink/purple for a gift- or in case or pacifier emergency!",5,1
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","Beautiful colors, soft and super easy to use. Really comfortable and perfect for big breast! It's a must have for new moms. I was really surprise..the fabric of this bra is excellent quality,I haven't seen any better than this one.",5,1
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I have the Medela Freestyle Pump which came with it's own hands-free system; however, whether by poor design or my ignorance, I couldn't get it to hold tight and would leak milk. I started looking for solutions and came across the Medela hands-free bra. I read a lot of reviews for it and came across one that said it did okay but the Simple Wishes one was awesome. I started reading the reviews on the SW one and decided to take a chance on it. I LOVE IT!!! Like many other mom's, I was unsure of the size to get. I am probably a 38C/D and though I was skeptical of the suggested size, I got the XS-MED. It fits perfectly. The Velcro allowed me to fit it right the first time and I haven't had to adjust it since. I didn't really see a use for the zipper extension in the front so I took it out. I don't use the shoulder straps either.I have used this bra 2-3 times a day for the last six months and it works as beautifully now as the day I got it! Fortunately, I have a desk job with my own office, so I am able to attach the pump and continue working!I wanted to comment on the individuals who left negative reviews and said, ""the only reason people are leaving good reviews is because the company will send them a coupon for 50% off another bra."" This is exactly why I am leaving a review. Why would I leave a review for a product I didn't like? Especially if my reward was for a discount on another one? So, by leaving this review, I am going to save on a 2nd bra and help other mothers in their quest for a great hands-free bra!",5,1
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I am a new mom a of twins and keeping up with pumping and feeding is quite a chore.  The hands free Breast Pump Bra is such a time saver as I can still get other things done while I pump. It fits really well and holds the shields in place.  I usually wear a size 34C bra, and the small is perfect.  The other nice feature is there are straps that come with and an insert for the front to quickly adjust the size.  The back has velcro for adjusting the size as well.I would definitely recommend this product for any mother pumping!",5,1
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L",This bra is great! I am a 34B and the XS to M fits perfectly. Allows you to use your hands while pumping giving busy moms the ability to mulitask! Would highly recommend. I plan in getting another on to keep at work.,5,1
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I was skeptical, thinking that it would leak a little bit, but it's an absolute perfect fit. This bra is essential for pumping. Now I can do anything while I pump, including writing this review!",5,1
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","The product was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. I love not having to hold on to the bottles while pumping and would definitely order this product again. It is so convenient that I am thinking of ordering another for when this one is in the wash. A must have for busy moms, I am pumping while I write this review!!",5,1
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I have been extremely pleased with this product. It fits perfectly if you dedicate the time to wash first then adjust it to your size. Also, it takes practice to wear this bra. Another important thing is I feel comfortable while wearing it and that's very important since pumping is not the most fun thing to do in my opinion. It holds up well after washes. The only cons I can think of is the price.",5,1
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I purchased another brands bra with a notable name and was disappointed because the sizing didn't fit my ever changing bust. I bought this and was happily surprised to learn that the wrap around is adjustable with Velcro! This is great because I was able to make the size fit perfectly and I could change it depending on how I was feeling that day. Definitely give this a try and save yourself from buying the wrong size. Also, these are easy to wash!",5,1
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","This bra cut my pumping time in half! And that's a lot when I work full time and want to keep my baby on breastmilk only. I love it! It stays in place, holds the shields where they need to stay and firmly, and is super easy to get on and off. It really is perfect!",5,1
The First Years Manual Breast Pump BPA Free,"This is perfect and easy. It takes longer to pump with the manual pump but that was expected. I just wanted one I could use at home so I don't have to haul my double electric pump home every weekend, especially since I have forgotten to bring it back on Mondays twice. I found the instructions for this to be very clear and concise on how to clean and use it. Everything is cleanable if you read the directions it tells you how to disassemble and re-assemble it very clearly. And it works great. I discovered that I can even use it while I am a passenger in the car with a blanket for privacy of coarse. It is much easier to use than the electric one, less to set up and put away. The only concern that I have is the caps for the bottles are the kind that leak but, I have allot of the kind of caps that don't leak. The caps that have &#34;first years&#34; within a circle, fit tight. The caps that have&#34; first years with the first years logo of people&#34; leak.",5,1
"Athena Nadia Baby Changing Table, White","I got this for a friend. Its the perfect changing table. I got white in case she wanted to personalize it. Great craftsmanship, would buy again. Good price.",4,1
The Wean Machine Portable Baby Food Maker,"I purchased this at a store (for more than what it's being sold for here at Amazon!  Should've checked here first!!!) and it's such a simple, yet ingenious gadget!  It's seriously like an oversized garlic press, which is GREAT for cutting up food for babies who are just beginning to eat solids!  It comes with a spoon that fits into its own little space, an extra hole-thingy that's slightly larger for when the baby can eat larger chunks, and a convenient cover that once you use, protects residual food from getting out and making a mess.  This gadget is perfect for taking to restaurants and then throwing it back in your diaper bag when you're done (then you can wash it when you get home.)  It's lightweight and well designed.  I've used it to cut up tofu, fish, noodles, and soft fruit so far.  It's so much easier and faster than trying to chop up the food with a spoon or cut it up with a scissor.  I need to be quick because once my boy sees the food, he wants it ASAP.  hahaha!The only thing I don't really like about this is that because the ""hole-thingy"" that basically acts as the blade to cut up the food isn't flush against the bottom when you pull it down, there's always some food that doesn't get cut up.  I guess that's inevitable.  I looked at my garlic press and it's designed the same way as well, so I'm assuming there must be a reason for it.  ALSO, the fact that the ""hole-thingy"" is made of plastic makes me wonder if it's going to able to cut up harder foods.  I haven't tried harder foods yet, but I'm hoping that I won't be disappointed.I was really excited when I bought this gadget and I'm not disappointed.  It's great to keep in my diaper bag when I go out to restaurants and for quick cutting.  I definitely don't think it's intended to be used to prepare a bunch of food to be stored.  I use my Beaba Babycook for that!  But I love that I can go out to eat and give my baby some of the (appropriate) foods that I'm eating.",4,1
"Stork Craft Child's Glider, Oak",Great Chair. My kid likes to rock to sleep and this chair is the perfect for him to wind down.,5,1
,"My son is now 2 years old, we bought this when he was about 7 months, it's so handy and fits perfectly for our needs. Ice pack keeps cool for pretty much the whole day, and the packs fit perfeclty in its pouches. Totally recommend.",5,1
,"My MIL keeps my daughter during the day and this bag is perfect for transporting 15 oz of frozen BM (in bags) and 1 small 5oz Medela bottle. It keeps them nice and cool for a short trip, and when I get the empty bag back at the end of the day the ice is still kinda cold! The little pouch on the front isn't really great for storing much, though.",4,1
"Stork Craft Tuscany 4 in 1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, White","I really was looking for a certain color crib and I was worried about purchasing online without seeing it first, but this crib looks exactly like the picture.  I got the oak color and am not sure what the difference is between that and cognac, but this one is perfect.  Our baby isn't born yet so I don't know how it will hold up.  However, the screw things that hold the base in place were very difficult to get in without stripping them.  These are the ones that will be used to lower the base and so we will need to try to get replacement ones.",4,1
"Stork Craft Tuscany 4 in 1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, White","We are very happy with this crib.  Our baby loves being in it, and we get lots of compliments from our friends that it looks like 'real' furniture not some baby 'toy'.  We got it in dark chocolate to match the color scheme of our home, and it looks fantastic.  It was relatively easy to assemble and it is very sturdy.  The mattress we bought was 'Simmons Kids Pampering Sleep Supreme 234 Coil Baby Crib and Toddler Mattress', and it is a perfect fit.  I've read some other reviews, and though I agree that you could leave a dent in the wood if you try, I wouldn't say it dents any easier than any other furniture we've got.  Also, I don't find that the bolts are too noticeable.  Ours are dark to match the wood and they blend in nicely.  And because they are open, you've got easy access to them, which means easier to assemble.  Overall I'm extremely happy with this purchase and would buy this crib again if I had to.",5,1
Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack,"I looked at a ton of drying racks before settling on this one, and I am so glad that I ended up choosing it over all of the other ones.  It has a ton of great features- such as the cup in the middle for straws, spoons, or even to dry the little nipple brushes after I use them to clean out the bottles.  I find it plenty big enough- I was able to fit 6 plastic Dr. Brown bottles and all of their corresponding components on there with some room to spare.  I found the 6 slots perfect for standing up the travel discs that come with the bottles, so that they don't get lost or slide off in the shuffle.  I also really appreciate that it drains into itself, so I don't have to keep it next to the sink and worry about it getting splashed with dirty water.  It is really easy to clean and it rotates so all areas of the rack are easily accessible.  It isn't super huge, so if you are planning on bottle feeding exclusively and having to clean a lot of bottles all at once- this might not be the rack for you.  But, it is the perfect size for me, and I love the fact that it doesn't look like a typical drying rack.  I highly recommend it!!!",5,1
Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack,"It takes up a lot of room, but this is a great drying rack for bottles.  I use the Medela bottles right now, and it's the perfect size for my day or two's worth I wash.",5,1
"Delta Universal 6 Drawer Dresser, Black Cherry",I had to write a review for this because this dresser exceeded my expectations. For the price it looks like a higher end dresser. The  size is perfect and exactly as listed. There was one little scratch when it arrived but it is barely noticeable. Would definitely recommend to anyone.,5,1
"Delta Universal 6 Drawer Dresser, Black Cherry","This dresser is nice quality, looks great and was easy to assemble. It matched the existing furniture perfectly and we have had no problems with it so far!",5,1
"Delta Universal 6 Drawer Dresser, Black Cherry","Bought this in black for our sons nursery. Wasn't too sure about how it would look once put together, but it's great! It's a perfect size so that he'll be able to use it for years. We love the nice shine that it has too. Great buy!",5,1
"Delta Eclipse Changing Table, Black Cherry","I love this changing table. Very cute and goes perfectly with our nursery. Although when we received it and started putting it together, some of the holes where slots are supposed to go in were off...They were not in the correct spot so we had to drill two new holes in order for it to fit together. Very frustrating when something that simple could have been avoided. Other then that we love it and it is a great quality and very affordable.",4,1
"Delta Eclipse Changing Table, Black Cherry","Package came not heavy to move and i am 7mo pregnant. Easy assembly, solid wood, beautiful color, extremely shiny, goes with our dark cherry nursery perfectly.  I highly recommend it.",5,1
"Growing Up Green Potty Seat, Natural",I did't buy this product for the ""green"" factor.  I bought it because I wanted a seat that I could clean that didn't have any plastic parts that secretly keep urine around.  All those seats that you get at stores end up smelling up my bathroom after a few months of use.  This seat so far is perfect. I can wash it and it is a nice solid piece that is actually nice looking. It looks like you spent a lot of money on it.  The only thing that could be a problem is I am using this seat for a girl but I don't think I would have been able to use this for my son when he was younger.  It doesn't have that pee guard that boys really need.... I could be wrong.,5,1
SheetWorld Fitted Pack N Play (Graco) Sheet - White Quilted - Made In USA,I bought this mattress pad for the Dream on Me 3 inch  mattress. It washes nicely and fits the mattress perfectly.,5,1
Baby Jogger City Micro Double Stroller - Black,"We looked everywhere for a stroller that would fit our needs; we have two kids 15 months apart.  The side-by-side seemed more maneuverable than the tandem models, and after seeing some at the stores, it felt like the side-by-side would make talking to the kids much easier.  Having used the stroller for a month or so, we couldn't be happier.  This stroller folds down more easily than our single did, and is really light.  The width is perfect: fits through doors and turn-styles (another inch or two wider, and it wouldn't).  Our only change would be easier access to the storage netting beneath the seats.Great option, and better value than the more expensive strollers.",4,1
"Carter's Forest Friends Lamp Base And Shade, Tan/Choc, 5.5 X 12&quot;",This lamp goes perfectly in my nephews room. All the animals are adorable and it is a unique and CUTE lamp!,5,1
"P'Kolino Little Sofa Lounge, Red",I love it!  It's perfect.  The size is a bit smaller than I expected but overall the quality is very nice.  There is even some pouch on the side to put some little stuff...many year of use to come.,4,1
"WhodaThought Mrs. Smith's Diaper Bag, Pink Polka Dot","I absolutely LOVE this bag.  I cloth diaper (using mostly pocket diapers) and because of the added bulk I was using 2 ""regular"" bags every time I left the house - then I discovered Mrs Smith's bag and my life changed!  It fits EVERYTHING I need (and more)!  I could never go back to a regular diaper bag.One of my absolutely favorite features of this bag is the drawer.  It makes the bag SO versatile!  For long day trips, I remove the drawer and use the bottom compartment to store extra diapers, it's nice and roomy and I can fit 4-6 diapers plus a wet bag!  When I need to transport breastmilk, I put diapers in the top compartment and I leave the insulated drawer in the bottom (where I add an ice pack and store the bags of milk).  It works out perfectly!I love that there are pockets for all of my things, as well.  There's a place for my wallet, a place for my sunglasses, keys, water bottle, etc.  There is also lots of extra room for my older son to store his video games and books when we're out.  My one year old loves to snuggle and cuddle the bag because of it's plush fabric (one of the reasons I picked the exotic bag).  This is truly the best diaper bag ever,  thank you Mrs Smith!",5,1
"NoJo - Jungle Tales Luxury Plush Throw, Brown",This is such a nice blanket!! It's soft and warm and washes really well. Its perfect for either a boy or a girl and the animals and colors are super cute!! Would definitely purchase again!,5,1
Crib / Toddler Baby Pillow - Made In USA,perfect sign for the 6 month old for her new pink camo room. as described on this product. liked it,4,1
Custom Cradle Mattress - size: 12x28x2,"We purchased this mattress for a cradle that my husband had built for our first granddaughter. In the wood magazine, where we got the pattern for the cradle, they had this listed and i was glad to find it on amazon! I must say that besides for the mattress being perfectly fit for the cradle, we received great customer service as well! I frantically called that the baby was due in 1 week, and they had it shipped within 2 days! I will definitely order from ababy again.",5,1
Cloth Diaper Sprayer--styles may vary,"Perfect for cloth diapering. Installs easily and the price is great. Handles the water pressure well. We've had it for a few months now and there's been no leaking or problems yet. The hose is quite durable and rigid, so the holder included (only sticky-back tape, but you could screw it to the wall with the screws included) didn't quit cope with it.Works great.",5,1
Tiny Love Musical Nature Stroll Toy Bar,"This item arrived with a dead battery.  It works perfectly now that replacement has arrived. Fits on diaper changer table, bassinet, car seat, high chair and baby adores this toy.",4,1
Tiny Love Tiny Princess Mobile,"I was hesitant to buy this at first, since it was brand new and there were no reviews out on it yet.  But, let me tell you - it was worth every penny!  This mobile is made by the same company as the popular 'symphony in motion' mobile, so the quality and durability is there.  For us, we loved the princess theme of the mobile and of course the cute pink colors.  Just like the symphony in motion mobile, the top part of the mobile can be detached from the music box base part.  There is a night lite option as well, and you can select either loud music or soft.  The classical songs that this mobile plays are perfect for soothing a tired baby or just as background music.  Another perk for us is the included remote control.  We hang it near our bed, so that we can operate it from across the room (baby's crib is in our bedroom).  If you are considering this mobile for your baby girl, we highly recommend it.",5,1
Tiny Love Tiny Princess Mobile,"This mobile is so perfect for a baby girls room.  I was a bit reluctant since the colors in picture seem so bright however, they are not. They are more muted and a perfect compliment for any pink baby decor.  This is such a great idea over the standard mobiles that match the baby bed sets; it has a light on the crib part, plays 5 different songs and has a handy s remote, you can take the mobile piece off when the child get older and just use for the light and music and it's actually cheaper than most of the ones for the matching sets. I just love it!  Haven't actually used it with my baby yet as she has not yet arrived but my 2 1/2 year old son is really excited about it, we had a great time trying it out!",5,1
"Prince Lionheart pottyPOD, Blue",My two year old boy is tall for his age and this seat was perfect for him.  I love how comfortable it seems to him and how easy it is for me to clean.  Great seat!,5,1
Sesame Street Construction Zone 4 Piece Toddler Set,I ordered this bedding set for my 2 year old little boy because he just loves Elmo. He still sleeps in a crib and I just love how it fits so perfectly! The colors are bright and the fabric is a soft micro fiber material. My son loves it and is excited to sleep in his ""Elmo bed"". A neat feature is that the fitted sheet has elastic and is gathered at the end so that he can't pull it up and it makes making the bed quicker too. I live in Hawaii and the shipping was super fast and it was free! So a great deal all around!,5,1
"Carter's Green Elephant Hamper, Green/Choc, 17  X 16 X 27&quot;","This hamper matches the room perfectly.  It is cute as can be. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem very sturdy.  I may have my husband, who happens to be very handy, rework the frame.",4,1
CoCaLo Turtle Reef Lamp Base and Shade,I was actually given this lamp as a gift. I love it! There are three light settings to it: 1) the light under the lampshade- which is perfect for reading; 2) the light inside the turtle shell- perfect as a night light or for night time activities in the nursery when you don't want too much light; and 3) both lights are on.,5,1
Novelty Mini Shopping Cart,"I was shocked at how cute this shopping cart turned out to be!  It's made exactly like a real shopping cart.  The cage under the seat lifts up and the seat closes like a real shopping cart.  It's the perfect size for Barbie dolls, if that gives you an idea.  I'm pretty sure this thing is indestructible, too.  All of the kids in our family fight over this thing, I need to buy 8 more of them.  Quite a deal for such a great price!",5,1
"Sugar Booger Kiddie Play Back Pack, Prehistoric Pals","I waffled a bit over buying this backpack, having read about the issue of size from other reviewers, and having measured it out on paper beforehand and realizing that it is, in fact, exactly the size of a piece of notebook paper and thus, would likely not be able to hold an actual notebook-sized object.The deciding factor was the pattern. Skip Hop's Owl Pack is adorable -- and a little larger -- but my little girl only likes owls, while she LOVES monsters. And no doubt, this monster pattern is absolutely adorable. My daughter lit up when the package arrived today, and promptly put her backpack on. She is three and the pack looks so sweet and perfect on her. Even sweeter was the fact that she wore the pack ALL DAY long, while playing in the sandbox, filled with her Playmobil dinos for a trip to the grocery store where she insisted on walking and showing off the whole time (which ellicited many an admiring stare from onlookers, much to her pleasure). So, all in all, I've no doubt this will be a well-loved, well-used little item.But we had another motive. We were hoping this would be a pack that she could wear to 3K next year, in spite of the size. And I'm not sure it's ideal for that. It *will* actually hold a notebook of standard size or a full-size coloring book, a few of them actually, but they don't go in easily enough for my daughter to pack them up herself I don't believe, and the flap is somewhat resistant to velcroing closed when this sort of large object is placed inside. I can't help but wonder why the dimensions couldn't have been ever-so-slightly larger, or even if this pack were offered in a closer-to-standard backpack size for older kids? It's darn-near impossible to find a backpack that doesn't have PVC or some other nasty material, and that has kid-appeal too. I love the thick, cotton canvas of this. It's absolutely ideal -- and I think it'll survive washing too, though I may do it on delicate out of an abundance of caution. We'll soon find out as it does have a slightly chemical odor inside, perhaps from the finishing process, and I will probably wash it in the next few days.Overall, I'm pretty pleased with this little pack, and even if it doesn't pan out as a 3K backpack, I think it will see plenty of use as a convenient tote for toys, small books, and art supplies for outings. Or just, apparently, as a fun accessory to wear around everywhere.",4,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","My 19 month old daughter loves this backpack.  Or as she calls it, her ""cackcack.""  It is perfectly sized for her (she's small for her age, 22 lbs) and she can wear it on her back easily.  It is small as others have noted, so I expect her to outgrow it by 3 yrs old or so.  It has a cool little canvas nametag inside and a big zipper pouch on front.  So cute.",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog",Great for my daughter! It's perfect for preschoolers. Made very well. I plan on buying one for my son when he starts school.,5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","My daughter received this the day before they left on a plane trip.  She wanted something for her little 3 year old just to put her snacks and toys in for the plane ride.  When she opened it, my granddaughter had her put it on her and wouldn't take it off!  She had to hide it to get her into bed that night!  Today, she packed it and it is just adorable!  My little granddaughter immediately noticed the little mice zipper pulls.  Vibrant colors and just a fun design.  Good mesh of form and function and the absolute perfect size for a pre-schooler!  Bought the ladybug backpack for her little (baby) sister for future use and it is equally as cute.",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","Super cute backpack for my son. He started kindergarten and it was the perfect size for him, not too big. Well made and priced. I'm glad I found this backpack.",5,1

"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","Bought this backpack for my toddler to go to mothers day out one day a week.  It is the perfect size to fit diapers, a change of clothes, and his stuffed animal.  The side pouch is really useful for a sippy cup.  Great quality and very cute.",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","we LOVE the skip hop zoo pack!! my son got it from us for his 2nd birthday. he absolutely LOVES carrying it around, putting things in to it, taking things out of it, and playing with it when he's not wearing it.it's the perfect size for munchkins; has enough space for travel wipes, a few diapers, and a couple toys. not too big, so it's easier to make sure that the load is appropriate for what your child can handle to carry.straps have plenty of &#34;growing room&#34; in them, so i expect i'll get a good few years out of it.there is a place inside to write your child's name, and it's decent sized (his name has 12 letters in it, i was able to write it with a standard sharpie).the zippers have larger sized pulls on them, which makes it easy for tiny hands to open and close the pockets.there is a special place for a sippy cup, however, we've noticed that putting a cup there throws our guy a little off-balance. i'm not sure that there is a way to fix that (aside from putting a sippy cup on the other side too) so, since i have no solution, i did not take any marks off. i'm sure that as he gets bigger, we will be able to use this.we get A LOT of compliments on it, as well!! this company DEFINITELY had toddlers in mind!",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","My boys love this colorful dog backpack. Its perfect for sunday school or daycare. Has lots of room for there diapers, toys, and cup.",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","Cute bag, very well made. Not huge, but perfect size for my 2 1/2 year old toddlers for our airplane ride. (One each). Enough room for toddler jacket, blanket, and baby (can't leave home without your baby) in the main compartment and some small books/toys/crayons in the front smaller zippered pouch. Also great little water bottle net/mesh holder on one side, loved that! Overall great product, well made, very cute and would recommend.",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","This bookbag is adorable in person! It's the perfect size for my 2 year old, who is 35 inches tall & 30lbs (for reference). It's very roomy. Perfect for a change of clothes, a couple pull ups & wipes, and some small toys. My little monkey is excited to have a monkey bookbag!",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog",My daughter just loves this. She just comes out of her room wearing and it fits perfectly. Plus it is super cute!,5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","My niece loves this adorable little backpack.  We got it for her for Christmas and she uses it to carry her toys to daycare.  It's the perfect size for a toddler and allows children to practice carrying their own toys and belongings, and remembering to pack them up at the end of the day to go home.  I believe the zipper has a nice sized pull tab, which is also ideal for little hands.  If you are looking for something big enough to carry home papers from school without bending, this will be too small, but it is perfect for little ones that just want to practice a little independence, plus the design is just too cute!",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","Very cute backpack that I bought for my 1 year old grandson. This is not a big bag, but perfect from coming over to grandma's house.",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","My son LOVES his backpack!  It is the perfect size for him.  He is 2 years old, so he still has room to grow into it, but we are able to fit an outfit in it, a blanket, a sippy cup, a book or two and a few diapers!  It is just as adorable as in the pictures, we get many compliments on it and my son does not like to go anywhere without his backpack!  Will be buying another one for our little girl!",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Penguin","This was a perfect size for my preschooler, and I'm very happy with the quality.  It would NOT be big enough for a full size folder, but fits his stuffed animal, blanket, sippy cup, and papers.  We got the matching lunchbox and have gotten lots of compliments on the set.  Love this box and backpack.",5,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bath Center,I bought this when my baby was 4 months old and it fits perfectly in our farm house sink and we don't need to use the legs. The strange this is the legs are not attached and it comes loose with 2 screws. Nice thick plastic seems sturdy. The temperature gauge is what makes this a great little tub.,4,1
Trend Lab Blooming Bouquet Bib Set Max,"I actually love these!!  These are perfect size and very absorbent.  My daughter has acid reflux, so she lived in a bib till she was 7 months old.  These definitely did the trick, plus they were super cute to match her outfits.  I bought most of the prints b/c I was so happy",5,1
Trend Lab Willow Teal Set of 4 Burps,"I LOVE these burp cloths! Some other reviews complained of the cloth's small size, but in my opinion the size is great. It fits perfectly on my shoulder, covering it entirely, and the terry cloth on the other side is super-absorbant. I have never had burp cloths that can handle the mess of spit-up so well. One review said that the cloths somewhat shrunk in the dryer, but I didn't have that problem at all. I have been using them for almost 3 months and they still look new, even drying them in high heat. I like these burp cloths so much that I am buying some for a friend on mine.",5,1
"Cardinal Gates Auto-Lock Gate, Black","This product fit our narrow hallway perfectly. We live in a 1930s house and have a steep staircase to the upstairs and a curved bottom step. Couldn't figure out how to get a baby gate to fit without removing the baseboards. Because we could install the handle for this underneath the railing, it worked great. Our son is now able to do the stairs just fine, so we removed the pin and took the gates out. Left the bracket on one side in the event we have another one and need to have the gate access.",5,1
"Cardinal Gates Auto-Lock Gate, Black",This is a good quality gate and I like the one-hand operation of the locking mechanism. It takes some time to install and get the adjustment fine-tuned but it works perfect once adjusted.,5,1
"Cardinal Gates 21.75&quot; Extension for Stairway Special Gate and Auto Lock Gate, White","This was perfect to extend our gate. Even though the original gate was purchased 7 years ago, I was pleased to see the quality and craftsmanship has not changed. We had no issues installing it and it does the job well.",5,1
Cloud b Gentle Giraffe On The Go Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds,"We got one of these for our son and the sounds are perfect. He loves them and so do we.  When he was smaller we could hang the giraffe in his crib but now that he's bigger he just plays with it instead of sleeping, so we just hang it where he can't see it and it does it's magic.  We got one for our new cousin too and she loved it right away. =)",5,1
"Redmon For Kids, Kids Folding Camp Chair, Red","kid loves to climb in and out of this thing, will be great for the summer and camping. perfect size for growing",5,1
"Redmon For Kids, Kids Folding Camp Chair, Red",This is one of the best investments.  Needed to find a chair for my 2 and 4 year old to sit on when watching TV.  They like to sit near to the TV and I got tired of watching them sit on the floor.  My 4 year old fits perfectly.  My 2 year old actually need a foot rest to be comfortable.  We use them at home and when we go to the Zoo or Beach.  My sister loved them and decided to get some for her kids.,5,1
"Graco Sarah Classic Convertible Crib, White",This crib is absolutely gorgeous! My husband put it together very easily and it seems to be made very well. The cinnamon color isn't too reddish or orange. It's just perfect!,5,1
"Graco Sarah Classic Convertible Crib, White","I absolutely love this crib. I was nervous when I saw the price thinking it might be poor-quality, but it's beautiful and such a great deal. It came in perfect condition and I would definitely recommend this crib. I spent 3x as much money with my 1st son's crib and I'm just as happy with this one.",5,1
"Baby Aspen Big Dreamzzz Baby Camo Layette Set with Gift Box, Tan, 0-6 Months","I hope this outfit is as cute as the photo of it.  I thought it a perfect gift for the little newborn son, born to a Marine.  Bet he will look adorable in it!",5,1
"BabyLegs for Moby Wrap Leg Warmers, Fade to Pink","I bought these babylegs for my daughter to go with her fuscia moby wrap. They match perfectly and look great! Babylegs are great for cloth diapering, too! No need for pants to cover up your cute prints, and diaper changes are a breeze! I'll be getting more of other colors soon!",5,1
"The Safe Sippy 2 2-in-1 Sippy to Straw Bottle, Pink",Love the safe sippy! My lo loves it too. I am wary of plastics so this item is perfect and durable in stainless steel. My breastfed baby took to this cup right away after we had tried a few others without success. We now have 3 of these. Easy to clean and well-made!,5,1
Princess : 6 Princess Lunch Box (Pink),"This lunchbox works great for my two year old daughter.  The handles are easy to grab and it has enough space to hold the Easy Lunchbox containters perfectly.  The plastic inside is easy to wipe down and keep clean.  The fabric outside (all but the plastic coated cover) seems to pick up dirt more than the rest of the box, but it is easy enough to clean up as needed. I wish the long shoulder strap was removable, but it doesn't get in the way when my daughter chooses to use the shorter hand strap.  Overall- good product!",5,1
Stokke Sleepi System Mattress Set,"We got these to go with our Stokke crib/bassinet, and have had no problems with themSome of the other reviews gave poor ratings for the bassinet mattress being so thin. While it is true the bassinet mattress is very thin, and you or I would not want to sleep on it, it's fine for a little baby (or big baby, like we have). Although it's thin, it's thick/sturdy enough that our son doesn't leave an imprint on it (i.e. I don't think he feels the wood base below the mattress). The other thing to consider is by the time your child is big enough to need more cushion, you'll have transitioned to the crib/bigger & thicker mattress!The sheets that are made for this mattress set will cost you an arm and a leg- we got around this by using the Aden + Anais changing pad cover for the bassinet mattress, and the Aden + Anais crib sheet for the regular crib mattress. They both don't have very defined corners (basically they both have a circle of elastic), so they fit the mattresses perfectly. And at a fraction of the cost!",4,1
"Infantino Twist and Fold Activity Gym, Vintage Boy","For the price this gym is great. I looked at tons of these things online before finally settling on this one. I wanted something gender neutral that wasn't themed (animal, ocean, etc...) I love the pattern and the toys that came with it are perfect. My son loves the mirror that came with it. And it's great that it folds up for easy storage and travel. It also does not take up a whole lot of room when out (something I was worried about because right now we live in a fairly small condo). Overall I am really pleased with this!",5,1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Polypropylene Bottle, Opaque, 4 Ounce, 2 Pack",The size is perfect. I'm a new mother and I think that this bottle is very easy to keep in your hand when your baby is eating. You can wash very easy,5,1
"Munchkin 5 Multi Plate, Colors May Vary","I love these, love the colors and the perfect size for what a kid eats! The will last as long as i need them",5,1
"Fantasy Furniture Comfy Chair, Flowers","My son got this for Christmas- he was 20 months old at the time.  It is the perfect size for him, and will continue to work for him for a while yet, I am thinking.  The pattern and colors are so cute.  I noticed no smell or anything from the product, and the colors have not bled onto anything.  It is pretty easy to clean up- a wet washcloth usually does the job.  It is pretty light weight- my son pushes it around the living room sometimes.  We will definitely keep these chairs in mind if we ever need another one!  It is pretty solidly made, and you cannot beat the price.",5,1
"Organic Bodysuit - Orange, 0-3 months","Beautiful, soft lil organic onesies, they were perfect in price and the mom of the baby loved them, I got her 3 of them and they were all adorable. GREAT PURCHASE, GREAT PRODUCT!",5,1
"green sprouts Silicone Freezer Tray, Green",This made making homemade purees for our baby simple.  Thawing a cube or two at a time was the perfect amount and saved us from wasting food.  I had a minor issue removing a cube from the tray once and the silicone ripped.  But we liked it so much we just bought another tray.,4,1
"green sprouts Silicone Freezer Tray, Green","These trays are far superior to others I've tried- they are much easier than most to get the cubes out of once they're frozen.  They clean up easily as well.  The frozen cubes fit perfectly in these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YQQQJW/ref=oss_product) for thawing and feeding.  I just pop the cubes into those containers, thaw them in the fridge, then heat them in a bottle heater- super simple.  I'd definitely recommend these trays to anyone planning to make their own purees for their baby!",5,1
"Neat Solutions Neat-Ware Table Topper, 60-Count","This is great for going out to restaurants so that my little one can eat from the table with us. She's 10 months old and loves her puffs, so this has been great to keep her occupied while we are eating our dinner. At first she kept trying to eat the edge of the table, which is gross, so we started overlapping the edge of the placemat around the table. Since it's sticky, this works perfect. The adhesive is firm, yet easy to peel off when we are leaving the restaurant. I don't know what we would do without these. We just keep a bag of these in her diaper bag at all times and are surprised at how often we end up using them. Would recommend to anyone who eats out even on an inconsistent basis like we do.",5,1
"Redmon For Kids Pre-Teen Beach Chair with Multiple Colored Umbrella, Purple","The chair is sturdy, umbrella works well and it's the perfect size for my 7yo daughter (with some room to grow).",5,1
"Redmon For Kids Pre-Teen Beach Chair with Multiple Colored Umbrella, Purple","This item is perfect, on windy days I wouldn't suggest putting the umbrella up because unless your sitting in it, or have it weighed down, it will blow away. This chair is very comfortable, I often sit in it if the kids are up and about, it is low to the ground, but that doesn't matter to us, I just extend my legs, and they just fit in it perfectly. I recommend this chair to anyone looking for an awesome beach chair with a little bit of attached shade, the umbrella adjusts in any direction or way you see fit and stays there after you've simply tightened it. There is also a velcro strap attached to the back of the chair so that the umbrella can remain securely attached and stored without worry. There is also a pocket on the back that the kids love to shove things into, I am truly amazed with how perfect this chair fit our needs, I couldn't have made a better choice!",5,1
Dreambaby Super Toy Hammock and Toy Chain,My youngest daughter loves stuffed animal more than any kid I've ever seen so this was perfect for keeping them up off the floor!,5,1
"CoCaLo Jacana Canvas Art, Orchid/Yellow/Lavender/Brown, 3 Piece",This was as expected. We started a jungle theme for our baby's play room and this is the perfect touch!,4,1
"Mud Pie Initial Baby Personalized Melamine Feeding Set with Pink Polka Dots, Letter J","This feeding set is adorable! It's colorful and bright, the only con is that the lid in the cup is not very secure and my daughter got a bit wet the first couple of times she used it. Perfect as a gift set!",4,1
Carter's Child of Mine Mommy's Sweetheart Pink Bear Security Lovey Blanket,I bought this for my daughter when she was 7 weeks old because she was pulling her covers over her head. This was the perfect solution. She got her snuggles and I didn't worry about her suffocating.,5,1
"JJ Cole Hamper, Blue Stripe",perfect little hamper...i'm using it in our beach themed guest room.very pretty and great pricing for a quality item.,5,1
"Dream On Me, 3 in 1 Portable Convertible Crib, Cherry","This crib is exactly what we wanted. We have limited space, so I wanted something smaller than a standard sized crib (which I feel are ridiculously big anyway) and we will be using it as a cosleeper, so I wanted a convertible crib where I could remove the front panel. The mattress that is included isn't great quality and we will not be using it, but I suppose it would work in a pinch. We purchased this mattress:Dream On Me 3"" Portable Crib Mattressto go with it and it is a perfect fit.",5,1
RiNGLEY Natural Teething Toy (Straight),I loved the natural wood teether and fabric concept of this.  My 8 month old loves to bite on wood so I thought this would be perfect.  Easy to take along and clip to things.,5,1
"Carters Snuggle Me Elephant Boa Blanket, Green",This blanket is the perfect thing to cuddle up with my son. It keeps him warm on these cold North Dakota days and I love the feel of it.,5,1
Kidco Mesh Window Guard,"We hated the bar looking window covers but knew we needed SOMETHING since we were moving to a second floor apartment.  This was perfect!  Easy to install, easy to open, totally worth it.  Highly recommend for peace of mind!",5,1
"Philips AVENT Range BPA-Free Front Teeth Teether, Classic","This teether is awesome. It is the perfect weight and size for little hands. We call this one squeeker since it makes a cool squeekey noise when it rubs over our babies gums.  The shape of this teether is also great, our daughter chews on the ""nose"" part and the wider ""face"" part is great for holding. The material is soft plastic, obviously different than water filled teethers. HIGHLY recommend!FYI- the directions recommend that you do not sterilize this item, just wash with warm water. We usually serilize everything so its a break from the norm for us... but still AWESOME",5,1
"Philips AVENT Range BPA-Free Front Teeth Teether, Classic","This teether is very simple.  It's the perfect size and shape for small hands, and it doesn't include any extraneous parts that could get in the way of its main purpose.  My brother's baby loves this toy and seems to prefer gumming it over his other, more complicated and flashy teethers.  I like that its phthalate-free and BPA-free.Avent categorizes its teethers into three groups:  Stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3.  This is a stage 1 teether, which Avent describes as ""Front teeth:  Massages gums and suitable for sterilization.""  Stage 2 is for middle teeth, and stage 3 is for back teeth.  Basically, stage 1 is for the earliest stage and is appropriate for small babies.  All in all, a good product from a reputable company.",5,1
"Philips AVENT Range BPA-Free Front Teeth Teether, Classic",My 6 month old's favorite teether. It is easy for him to hold and manipulate. The nub it perfect for front teeth chewing. I highly recommend.,5,1
"Trend Lab Storage Caddy, Ultrasuede Brown/Pink",Every mommy needs this! This is by far my favorite baby item! It is perfect for toting around the house. Keeping everything organized....and easy diaper changes! I store all gas drops and baby meds in the pockets. This is great for diapers and wipes...ideal for the first few weeks of bringing baby home when you need to move fast (esp for little boys),5,1

"Trend Lab Storage Caddy, Ultrasuede Brown/Pink","This was perfect to organize diapers, wipes and whatever else we need to move from room to room to change the baby.",5,1
"Trend Lab Storage Caddy, Ultrasuede Brown/Pink","Of all the diaper caddy's I have used over the last 15 years, this is my very favorite!  It's so organized!  3 large sections in the middle and pockets all around!  Sections in the middle are optional:  they are buttoned in, so you can remove if needed.  Very sturdy!  Stands on it's own, but when stuff is inside, even better!  Very well made.  I'm getting another one for downstairs.  Right now, I'm using it for TWINS and with 2 different sized diapers, this works perfectly!  Favorite Baby Wipes from Costco fit perfectly!  I put one pkg on the bottom and one on top, then I never run out.  Fits perfect!  LOVE THIS!!!  My excitement comes from many years of searching for the perfect caddy!  AND THE PRICE IS AMAZING!  Great Job Trend Lab!",5,1

Puma Baby All White Gripper Socks- 3 Pack(Infant to Baby) (12-24 months),"I was able to find lots of brands that had 6-12mo socks with grippers for my son (before he could walk, so the grippers were wasted) but once he started walking I could not find them anywhere in 12-24mo size. These were the only white 12-24mo sicks with grippers I could find anywhere and I love them. They are perfect for new walkers.  Also, the red you see in the picture is of the sticker that holds the pairs together.",5,1
"Lifefactory Silicone Nipples Stage 1, 2 Pack, Clear","These are great nipples, our exclusively breastfed baby has taken to them and had no trouble.  I do wish that Lifefactory would find a way to clearly mark the different stage nipples, it would make life much easier, but other than that I have no complaints.  I love our lifefactory bottles!Edit: baby is now 10months, we have put away the stage 1 nipples now, did that at 9 months, an was amazed at how well these nipples have held up through 6 months of constant use!  Top rack dishwasher every other day and they are still in perfect shape!  And word on the street is that these are now labeled with stage 1 on them, perfect!!!!",5,1

SoHo Pink with Black &amp; White Zebra Chenille Crib Nursery Bedding 10 pcs Set,"I'm not quite sure what others were talking about when it came to this product being negative. The colors were exactly as shown in the picture, the quality is great, and the set is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo adorable! It goes absolutley perfectly with the theme I was going with. You honestly can't beat this price, and the product was probably worth quite a bit more. Fast shipping to canada, would defiantly buy from again, and recommend! The only negative thing I noticed was the bed sheet was a little bit lower in quality, but really, it's a bed sheet it's 10 dollars at walmart and you'll need lots anyways. Set has been washed and placed in crib, awaiting our little arrival.Thanks again you guys, fantastic company!",5,1
"Dreambaby Banister Gate Adaptors, Silver",This works perfectly on my Munchkin (not Dreambaby brand) bottom of stair gate and has allowed me to avoid drilling into the bannister or purchasing expensive adapters.  It just screws into the existing holes that are otherwise filled with the pressure mounts.,5,1
Cotton Tale Designs Heaven Sent Girl Standard Lamp and Shade,"This lamp is a real beauty and it's just the perfect size. When it is lit up the shade looks like it is just glowing, really nice. I just don't understand why they call it a cottontale design, it is a floral design, but it is really pretty, worth the buy!!",5,1
MAYA WRAP Lightly Padded Baby Ring Sling Carrier (MEDIUM - BRIGHT STRIPE),"The Maya Wrap has been nothing but a lifesaver.I bought this wrap when my daughter was just six weeks old, and nearly a year later, I can still say that is is the best money I ever spent on her (aside from diapers, formula and food of course).At a year old, she is nearly 30 lbs, and when she wants to be carried the wrap is the only way to do it (otherwise, I can only handle her for a few minutes).It has especially been a lifesaver during plane trips (particularly when it was just us two), countless church services, and most recently... Disney World. She hated being in the stroller and as soon as my husband would pick her up, she would want to be put down to walk, but as soon as I put her in my wrap, she would relax and take her much needed nap while we continued to enjoy the shows without being tied to the stroller (since everything at Disney requires the stroller be left behind).Some additional notes, it's perfect to use as a nursing cover when the baby is smaller and the rings are great for clipping toys and tethers to keep baby entertained.I definitely definitely recommend this product.",5,1
The Shrunks Wheeled Travel Bag,"My husband thought I was silly to buy this blow up bed...,  Until he had to set it up one night when I was gone. In about 30 secounds or less... a twin size bed for our grandchildren!  Mommy & Daddy  ask to borrow it all the time.  It is just perfect.  Our grandson is 2 1/2 yrs. 42&#34; tall... plenty of room!Every home with children need this for sleep overs... camping... travel.  You can place it under the sheets of any bed and the child has protective sides so child does not fall out of bed!  Quality plastic, soft suede center cover.  We got the carrying/ storage bag with wheels too.",5,1
Sassy Crib and Floor Mirror,"My 3 month old son hated tummy time and would not lift his head when laying on his tummy. Once we put this in front of him, he lifted his head and reached out for the leaves, which make a crunchy noise. It would perfectly for what I expected it to do, which was to make tummy time productive. I plan to use it later on in his crib.Only drawback is that the mirror collapses easily and can fall on him if not on a hard flat surface, but the mirror is light enough not to hurt him even if it falls on his head.",5,1
Sassy Crib and Floor Mirror,"I saw some reviews saying that this mirror wouldn't stand up and it didn't reflect properly, but I ordered it anyway. It stands up perfectly fine, even on a textured carpet. Of course, because it is not real mirrored glass, it is a bit distorted if you are far away. If you are closer to it, it's not a problem. I put this on the floor near my daughter's play mat and she loves to look and smile at herself. I think it's a good toy to have around! Yes, I'd recommend it.",4,1
"Sassy Go Go Bugs, Styles May Vary","My baby absolutely loves these Go Bugs. These were the first toys he noticed when his eyes where developing.  We kept them by his changing station until his eyes developed enough to see them on his stroller.  Now he is completely memorized by these every time we take the stroller out.  They are so simple, but the color contrast is perfect for little developing eyes and the sounds are completely different. (His favorite is the black and white bug)",5,1
Simmons Kids Pampering Sleep Supreme 234 Coil Baby Crib and Toddler Mattress,This is a perfect combination for an infant and then a toddler. It is a great price as well! At first when looking at mattresses for my baby I thought I needed the expensive ones. But after reading a book with baby bargains in them I realized that the expensive ones are a waste of money and that a mattress like this is all we will need for the next few years. Would definitely buy again!,5,1
"GEENNY Boutique Crib Bedding Set, Beautiful Black White Flower and Dot, 13 Piece","I recently received this, bought it off of Amazon, I had fallen in love with it when I found it online at walmart but it was to expensive and when I checked Amazon I immediately ordered it, when I put everything together, it was beautiful, I LOVE THE PRINT AND THE FABRIC and everything about it! Love that singe of the prints are embroiderd, took me forever to find something as pretty as this, i'm having a baby girl and for some reason I don't like baby stuff like Dora pooh and animations on my Babys stuff i'm more of a cute classic stuff for my daughter and this bedding set was perfect! I also bought the mobile it was so easy to set up everything looks beautiful!!!! Especially on a white crib! :)",5,1

Athena Allie 3-in-1 Convertible Crib (Cherry),"I've had this crib since October 2012 (baby was due end of Dec/beginning of Jan).  This crib was purchased for my at my request (but in the espresso color) because I'm very short and liked the dip in the front.  It arrived in perfect condition and was super easy to put together, although it did take some time and with the help of my husband.  My son is now over a year old and still loving his bed!!  Every once an a while (only twice now since having it and in two different places), I've had to re-tighten the screws, but only because he likes to shake the front or back and it just gets a little loose.  Not a flaw on the crib, just my aggressive son.  :)  Also, the wood does chip easily if bitten or banged on by anything that has a hard surface (i.e. - a stuffed animal with plastic eyes).  I have read that all cribs do that, and I simply bought crib rail wraps (by Trend Lab) and problem solved!I'm now pregnant with my second and looking to buy the exact same one!!",5,1
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Brontosaurus","Using this as a night light for my little one and it works great.  She loves staring at it and seeing the colors change.

"HALO SleepSack Plush Dot Velboa Wearable Blanket, Cream, Medium",I love rocking my little one to sleep in this minky fabric.  It is so so soft and cuddly which is perfect for these cold nights.  I still don't feel comfortable putting blankets on him so this keeps him warm and sets my mind at ease. I wish I had bought this one earlier.,5,1
"HALO SleepSack Plush Dot Velboa Swaddle, Cream, Newborn","The Halo SleepSack has very soft fabric, and is perfect for babies that want to have arms in or arms down. The zipper is a nice feature for quick changes",5,1
"HALO SleepSack Plush Dot Velboa Swaddle, Chocolate, Newborn","I received an identical blanket at a baby shower and loved the soft, cozy material so I knew this sleep sack would be perfect.  It's roomy enough for my little guy to grow with.",5,1
"Manhattan Toy Pull-A-Long Friend, Puppy","This was a gift for my 21-month-old daughter.  She loves dogs, and she loves this toy.  I love that the paint and finish are non-toxic.  The wheels roll smoothly, and my daughter likes that the dog's head goes back and forth when she pulls it along.  I think it's the perfect size for a pull toy.  The rope is a bit short, but I just tied a piece of ribbon to make it slightly longer.",5,1
"Spasilk 10 pack Soft Terry Washcloth, Blue",These are the perfect baby wash cloths - small and thin. Not sure why people are faulting them for being small and thin. I like that they're thin because then they're great to use for things like wiping baby's face and eyes.,4,1
Lamaze After-Pregnancy Perineal Healing Spray,"i had a 3rd degree tear with my first daughter and used a spray that was medicated that the hospital gave me, this time around i wasn't going to a hospital so i knew i would need to by something and turns out i had a 2nd degree tear this time so i did need it....this is what i chose and it helped a great deal....only down fall it that it is hard to get it to spray when you hold it upside down which is the easiest way to spray it where you need to...i didn't even use a half a bottle and used it for 4 weeks :) so i think a smaller size with a differnt pump and it would be perfect",4,1
Vibrant Butterflies Nursery/Kids' Room Wall Sticker Decals (Glow in the dark),"Got these for my 3 year olds room, they are perfect.  You can actually remove and replace without having to worry about taking paint off of the wall.  Just wish that there were more then one sheet of the butterflies.  that would have made it even better.",5,1
"ShadyBaby Sock Monkey Stroller Parasol, SPF 50+ Stroller Umbrella - 24&quot; Diameter","I saw this on the Shadybaby website for $35 but got it for $20 here.  Perfect condition.  you just clamp onto any bar on the stroller, tighten and open the parasol.  It has a small bendy party that allows you to angle the parasol.  It's perfect for our walks and the sock monkey is a cute design!We use it everyday, literally.",5,1
Kinderville Little Bites Cups Set of Four,"We got these cups for our two toddler boys and for us, they were the perfect size. Yes, sometimes we refilled them a lot, but if we'd given them anymore, they would have picked up the whole thing and spilled it. We always prefer to err on the side of less food and less mess and possible seconds (or thirds).Lovely to have something that isn't going to break when dropped. For me, these didn't smell like plastic (well, they Aren't plastic) - there was no bothersome scent to me.And the boys loved picked a color to drink from (wearing a green shirt? get the green cup). I do wish the ""blue"" was a little more blue.Our biggest problem with these is they are nice and squishy. This was fine for our older child (I think he was 2.5 when we got these?) but our younger son is a mess lover and food scientist and would sometimes squish the cup sides together when full, causing a spill.We were willing to live with this occasional mess for the benefits though. We did finally trade them out for some Duralex Picardie glasses in the 7.5oz size to match my husband and I's bigger glassware. Yes, they are glass, but very break resistant and the boys have yet to break one of theirs, though nothing is magic of course.These glasses live on in the bathtub however, as a favorite bathtoy. I love that it's something non-plastic that won't mold in the tub and the boys love stacking and pouring and all kinds of things with them. And the new baby loves to teethe on them. In fact, I was reminded to write a review as I was adding them to our wishlist.",4,1
"Dream On Me 2 Position Baby Bather Bath Tub, Yellow",we are using this every day and we love it. it fits perfectly to our tub and the kids love taking baths in it.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I love this little rocker.  It is very lightweight and portable and the incline is perfect for my reflux cursed newborn.  The rocking component is very basic and simple, but once he is asleep, no need for rocking.I like the seat belt feature as it will make this purchase last a little longer than a few months.He likes to sit in it as well as it gives him a better view than flat on his backThe reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 are these....1. I find it a little cumbersome to collapse (though maybe should be a pro for safety reasons, but I am thinking of my use)2. I do wish it had a vibration feature of some automatic rocking button (but the simplicity I am sure keeps the price low)All in all, I am happy with this purchase, but would not say it is a must have.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I have never reviewed anything before. This little bed was SO GREAT I felt compelled to. Bought this for my third baby. Really wish I had it for the first 2. He slept so well from day 1 in this bed. Also, it was the perfect height and portable enough to keep bedside or take camping with us. Would highly recommend this. You will not regret this purchase!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow",i purchased this for my baby girl London and she loves it! of chorus with plenty of tummy time during the day this bassinet was perfect for my baby girl. especially on the nights that she had to be close to mommy and daddy without being in our bed :),5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","When Our newborn was born, he had acid reflux, and this was the perfect solution -  he loved to sleep in this.  I did read other reviews on this so i was aware that the back of it is hard, i slid a blanked under the material (there is a slot where you can do this) so it is softer and my baby hasn't developed a flat head, however the doctor did notice at his 2 month check up that he always turns his head to the right and struggles to turn to the left.  The doctor says this is because the angled sleeper causes my baby to sleep with his head turned to one side because of the shape of the sleeper, and i should turn his head to the left when he sleeps.  I moved my baby into the crib for long naps and sleeps when he was 2 months, he is now 3 months and i just use this as somewhere for him to sit when we are having dinner or if we need to put him down somewhere (other than his activity mat) for a short period of time. His neck is much better now",4,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I went ahead and bought this sleeper and I am so glad I did!  After my c-section I had trouble climbing into the bed so I put the sleeper next to the couch.  Later on, we were able to easily move it to the bedroom.  My son loved to be rocked in it and the angle enabled him to see me when I put him down into it.It's lightweight and portable, so it was perfect when the in-laws came to visit and decided to stay in a hotel almost 2 hours away or when I took my son to the babysitter's house while we were having work done at our house.  I think this would be wonderful for grandparents/other people the baby frequently visits to have handy at their house as well because it folds and can be put away.  It easily fit into the trunk of my car.The yellow one comes with a little rabbit with a square of fabric attached and it rattles a little.  My son (now 8 months) loves this little toy and it's the perfect size for him to hold.I did read the warnings about the babies developing flat heads or their heads tilting to one side so I bought a Snuzzler to go with the sleeper.  Problem solved.  When our son was a newborn, we put the entire Snuzzler in with him and we were still able to buckle him in.  When he got older, we just used the part that went under his head.  It helped keep him snug and on his back.Overall this is a wonderful item, especially for those with limited space available, babies with reflux (a problem we thankfully didn't have), or for overnight stays with the baby.  It's affordable too, so I would also give this at a baby shower.",5,1
Mommy's Helper Slide-Lok Bi-Fold Door Lock,I was so worried my 2 and 1 year old would get there fingers caught in the bi-fold doors as their mommy has done it a few times and it was not pretty. These were the perfect solution and they don't break when you forget they are there. My husband and I would often forget they were even there and force the doors open with all our might and they would pop off but it required quite a bit of strength and the boys could never seem to get them to open so these were pretty amazing and if we live in another home with those annoying doors I will definitely be purchasing these again.,5,1
Mommy's Helper Slide-Lok Bi-Fold Door Lock,"We have a very small living place, so we use a bi-fold door as a bedroom door to save on space. These child proof slinging locks work perfectly to keep our kitty from being able to open our door and get in our room. We use two/door: one facing inside our bedroom and one facing outside. A neat alternative to a traditional door with a knob!",4,1
"Carter's Fashion Tote, Tonal Dot","I just love this Bag!! It has the perfect size, it is easy to clean and it has enough pokets!! You wont regreat!",5,1
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count",They are so soft. Perfect for new moms who are breast feeding. Easy to wash and dry. Good for multiple uses,5,1
Allison Diaper Bag in Black (As Shown),"This bag is AMAZING, and buying on amazon on sale saved me $90! I love this bag and I spent 3 weeks researching diaper bags of the regular and designer variety to find the perfect one that fits my style and looks like a purse as well as works like a diaper bag. It's well worth the money and the quality is excellent.",5,1
"Battery for Summer Baby Touch 02000, 02004, Slim &amp; Secure 02800, 02804, 02805, Best View 28030, 28034, 28035, SecureSight 02040, 02044, Universal Extra Battery",This is a perfect replacement for the older model Summer Baby video monitors.  Our battery was having trouble keeping a charge and would die after only a few minutes unplugged.  This battery resolved that problem for use and has extended the life of our video monitor.,5,1
"Think King Mighty Buggy Hook for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker, 2 Pack",I love our BabyJogger City Mini but the one thing that was a nuisance was that due to the handle design I didn't have a place to hang a small bag.  These are perfect for that purpose and now I love our stroller even more.Something I was originally concerned about was whether or not the hooks would stay in place (I thought perhaps they might slide down the handle once there was something hanging from them).  I'm happy to report that has not been the case! They have stayed exactly where I put them.I have purchased these for friends and recommend them to anyone who has a single handle stroller.,5,1
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Sleeping Bag, Oh Boy, Small","Not sure why this only had ok reviews. We've used it nightly for more than two months and it's holding up great. It has so much kicking room and is perfect for the warm months. I'll probably use it during the cooler months too with a heavier onesie underneath. I like that the zipper top is covered so it doesn't have the metal zipper top against his neck. This is my favorite of all the sleep sacks we've tried, and they run bigger than the sizes suggest, so it will get plenty of use to justify the price.",5,1
Bi-Fold Door Lock &quot;Slide-Lok&quot; from Mommy's Helper -- 2 PACK,"I did  not install these myself, but I will say that they work perfectly without much of an eyesore. However, when we have our shorter friends over, they are not able to reach the top of the bifold doors as easily.",4,1
"ERGObaby Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Natural",This insert worked perfectly for my first baby and we used it almost daily for walks or even to be close while doing chores around the house. It washes and dries well - holds it s shape. The only complaint I have is that I could never figure out how to make the adjustable closure stay synched after I snapped it in place.,5,1
"Disney 4 Piece Toddler Bedding Set, Taking The Race","When I was 4 I had a Rainbow Bright comforter that was made of like 100% plastic and kept losing all of its stitching.I don't know what fabric this is, but it's extremely comfortable. It fits his crib mattress perfectly.  The blanket is a little on the thin and light side, but right now it's warm so I approve. In the winter I can add in a fleece blanket, which I'd probably do anyway.What an adorable set, that has held up to months of washing frequently without fading or falling apart.  A really great purchase!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Precious Planet Wood Wall Plaque, Orange",I have been looking all over for the wall plaque and now that I have it am so glad I found it!  Its a good size and fits perfectly between the coordinating wall hangings!,5,1
"Recaro Vivo High Back Booster, Carbon","We did a ton of research before purchasing this seat.  It was really the only one in its price range with a nice amount of padding and comfort and it got great safety ratings and reviews.  If you have a smaller car and multiple passengers, it doesn't take up much room which is great.  It fits snug and perfectly into the back seat of our Nissan Cube.  It looks very cool with its race car engineering as well.However, my soon to be 8 year old son is tall and his shoulders barely fit under the side impact head protection.  He is very slim but feels crowded. We ordered it online so we could not see how he fit in it prior to purchasing.  We thought we could separate it into a bottom only unit, but it turns out that you cannot...I think for most people the seat would be a fantastic purchase aside from the height issue that we encountered.",4,1
Ladybug Lullabye High Chair Pad,"We have a 6 year old Evenflo high chair from our older daughter and the cover needed replacing.  This fit pretty well, not perfectly. But it's cute and does the job. Evenflo had no replacement options. But keep in mind it is WHITE and will need to be washed frequently even though you wipe it down after every meal. I did see there is a green one which may not show as much dirt.",4,1
"Clek 2010 Oobr Booster Car Seat, Paul Frank Zoom Julius","I recently bought this seat in solid black (rather than the Paul Frank version), for $[...]. I must say I am very impressed by this brand new seat (I think it was released in late 2008). Can be used in a variety of configurations: full back mode (33-100lbs, height 38-57in, at least 3yrs old; backless mode: 40-100lbs, height 40-57in, at least 4yrs. Comes in various colors (pink, brown, black, plus the scurvy and colorful stripy one). Conforms to Federal Motor Standards. Not certified for airline use (because airplane seats don't have shoulder belts).Here is a list of features you will not find in the Graco popular booster seat:1. To my mind, the biggest and most important (though not necessarily obvious to parents looking to upgrade from a convertible seat) advantage of all Clek seats: LATCH. Meaning that this seat, along with your child on it, is securely planted on the back seat and cannot move around. I remain unconvinced by seats held in place only by the seat belt and the weight of a child. Both the backless Clek booster and this one with the back (Oobr) have LATCH. Oobr in particular features an ingenious extendable LATCH that will pull out to firmly grab the deepest and most inaccessible LATCH bars.2. Magnesium back frame to better protect the torso during a side impact and vehicle intrusion; enough said!3. Back seat is not only removable (the lower part of the seat can be used independently, like a regular Clek seat), it also *reclines* up to 12o. Perfect for snoozing!4. Structural headrest with deep side wings that support the head during naps, and yet do not obscure side views. The headrest connects to the magnesium frame of the back using steel rods to reduce twisting movements and improve head protection in a collision. The headrest is also height-adjustable: it has a button and several adjustment spots and can be pulled up a good 20 cm, meaning it will grow with your child. This is so well designed it looks like a regular car seat headdress in a high end vehicle.5. Energy-absorbing foam layer to absorb energy of a side impact.6. Nicely designed and easy to use belt guides facilitating a snug fit of the seat belt on the child's shoulders7. Nicely padded bottom and back that doesn't cut circulation, especially e.g. under legs.8. Performance 'Crypton' fabric: stain, moisture and bacteria- resistant. Easy to clean.9. Plastic parts, including cup holder, are high quality. In fact, 100% North American derived content! No flimsy or suspect materials here.10. Feels lightweight despite the sturdiness.Other pros:1. Ease of use- took me 3 mins to install the seat, another 1 min to buckle my son in.2. All black version looks great, with its red contrasting parts (not too sure about the Paul Frank designs, seem overstylized to me; who wants to be driving this stripy crazy thing around for the next 5 years?).3. Comes with a detailed instructions booklet that can be stored in a special place under the seat.Cons:-Price: but safety features and excellent design justify the sacrifice.-Side contour in conjunction with armrest position reported to be somewhat restricting by my son. But maybe that's the point (to keep the child from moving around).Overall would highly recommend!",5,1
"Clek Oobr Booster Car Seat, Blue Moon","Was looking for the next-step seat to replace the Britax Roundabout.  Loved the Roundabout & Britax products so I went searching through their lineup but was unhappy with the installation of the Frontier and all the mixed reviews it had received.  The Clek Oobr is just what I was looking for - the highest safety rating possible with a simple installation that will likely be the last seat we need (as it converts to a backless booster for children up to 57"" and 100 lbs).  This seat is definitely the most sturdy booster I have looked at and makes the Graco booster (leftover from my first child) feel like a toy. The reclining feature is a bonus for a booster seat, but we have yet to use this feature for snoozing yet as most of our car trips are under 15 min.  You do use the recline to install the seat when using the ridged latch.  I had never seen a ridged latch prior to this seat and it was one of the reasons I was unsure about ordering it.  For all of you out there like me, I'll do my best to describe it.  Instead of the latch hooks hanging on the end of an adjustable belt that loops through the back of the seat (as in the case of the Roundabout), the ""ridged latch"" hooks are built into the base of the seat.  To install this seat, you pull the recline handle and the base of the seat towards you.  This action extends the two latch ""arms"" from the back of the seat, which you then line up with your seat latch eyes (not sure if thats the right term?) and click into place.  You can then adjust the seat to your preferred recline.  It is very easy and (I feel) even more secure than the latches on the adjustable belt because there is never any ""slack"" to worry about.  We used this seat recently in a vehicle without the latch system for the first time and although it is not as obviously not as stationary as when it is used with latch, I felt it fit much more snug than the other boosters I have experienced.  At 35 lbs and 39"" my child is at the very bottom of what is recommended for this seat, but the seat does a perfect job of keeping the belts in the correct position even on her small frame.  Only had the seat a month, but the fabric appears to be durable so I am optimistic - only time will tell.  Amazon had the best price I could find, and although it isn't cheap I feel the price is justified by the quality of the seat and the length of time we will be using it.  Definitely would recommend to others.  As always, quick shipping from Amazon!",5,1
"DaVinci Piedmont Changer Chest, Espresso","My husband and I love this changer/dresser. We were looking for something that could grow with our child but also be used as a changing table without the typical changing table top. We also wanted it to match our DaVinci Espresso crib, which this does perfectly. This piece is very solid and not too difficult to put together. The only thing I wish was different was that the changer/dresser was a little longer. All in all we are extremely pleased and would recommend this product.",4,1
"DaVinci Piedmont Changer Chest, Espresso",This was given as a gift and they loved it.  It matched the baby bed perfect.Took about an hour to put together.,5,1
"FuzziBunz Perfect Size Cloth Diaper, Cotton Candy, Large 25-40+ lbs","I love these diapers. When I first started using cloth diapers I bought a pack of Kushies and one fuzzi bunz diaper. The fuzzi bunz are a lot more money so I wanted to try both. I quickly found out why they cost more. Simply put, they rock. No leaks, the mess is an easy clean up if you use the Kushies disposable liners. When there is poop, just flush the liner and it leaves a relatively clean diaper. There might be a little poop on the corner where the liner isn't covering, but that is only with a softer stool.The only complaint I could have is when I bought the first Fuzzi bunz diaper (it came with a liner that fit inside perfect). When I just recently purchased my last five Fuzzi bunz diapers from amazon (the liners are smaller, almost like they were made for a smaller fuzzi bunz diaper).  They still work fine because I change very often. I have 11 diapers and I would like to have about 5 more so I can get away with washing every other day.Also... side note... I don't use these at night because I did it for one night and my son had a little diaper rash and he never has had any problems with diaper rash. So disposable at night and cloth during the day works great for me.",5,1
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","First off, let me say these are the cutest mainstream diapers.  Fuzzibunz has the best solid colors out there.  They are all very bright and vibrant.  I do love that.  These are the diapers you want to put on your baby if you want to ""show off"" cloth diapers.  Like I said, they're cute.  They are also the trimmest pockets I've yet to see.  They work really well also which is the main thing.  My son has never had a leak in these.The downside?  They're really quite small for OS diapers.  I honestly have a hard time believing they'll fit up to 35lbs.  The other con is the adjustable elastic is a pain.  I have a 2 year old and an almost 4 month old, both in diapers and I can't easily switch between the two with these diapers like I can with other OS, it would just take way too long.  So I just designated these for my youngest.  I have to admit though in general I'm not crazy about adjustable elastic instead of rise snaps.  I found it annoying in Charlie Banana diapers as well.  I do appreciate that they give you spare elastic and two inserts though.I have four of these and because of the size issue, I don't think I'll be investing in more because I fear he'll grow out of them too soon.  It's a shame because they really are great diapers.  Overall I think Fuzzibunz perfect size diapers are a better grab.  I have 8 Mediums that fit both my boys and I know at the very least they'll last through potty training for my toddler.",4,1
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","I was hesitant at first to switch to cloth diapers.  However, my son is almost 2 years old now and I wish we had started cloth diapering earlier!  The One Size fits him perfectly.  We have had zero problems with leaks or blow outs.  I was really nervous that they wouldn't fit him well, but so far, so good.  I haven't had to adjust the elastic yet, but it looks pretty simple.  My husband and I experimented with the right snap formation for the first few days, but now we have it down to a science!  They also wash up great.  There are no stains and no smell.  Also?  They are super cute!  I also think they're extremely easy to use, so I'd recommend them to any first time cloth diaper users.",5,1
"FuzziBunz 3 Pack Microfiber Inserts, Small","These are the perfect size and thickness for the one size pocket diapers. I used these in the bum genius, fuzzibunz, oh katy and happy heinys.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink","I care for my 5 month old granddaughter during the work week.  I needed a high chair that did not take up a lot of space (like a stand alone chair) and one that I can easily remove from a dining room chair when necessary.  This high chair works perfect!  Baby is still quite young so I haven't used the tray or booster part yet, but the chair itself, with cover, restraints, and position options works very well.  I have used the high chair to place Baby next to me when I'm using the computer.  She is happy chewing on toys while watching me work.  If she falls asleep for a short nap, I recline the seat for her.  Having Baby a little higher up from the floor sometimes (versus boppy pillow, bouncy seat, or jumparoo) gives her a little different view of her surroundings.  The mocha cover with butterflies is a fabulous color scheme.  I am a big butterfly fan and have butterflies on kitchen walls for accents.  I highly recommend this space saver high chair.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink",Ideal high chair. Perfect if you don!t have a lot of space. Would highly recommend this  for both genders .,5,1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink",I bought this for my sisters baby and it is so cute.  She is in the military and travels a lot so this seat is perfect for her to bring with her.,5,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,"This bouncer is perfect for babies and mommies alike! The toys are at the level of even a very young baby and it bounces easily so when baby moves it bounces a bit--not to mention you can easily bounce it with a foot from the couch to help soothe a little one! Plus, love that the toy bar removes so easily since I also use that often times to feed my little man in--it sits at a good angle so that the feeding time is easier when you start baby foods. Only minor thing is that the 'headrest' flap is upside down on ours--not sure if that's how they all are? It doesn't really matter it just makes it look silly when its unoccupied and the monkey is just hanging out upside down!",5,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,"I did alot of research looking for the perfect bouncer for my 2 and half month old son. I chose this one based on the very good reviews. It is sooo cute and good quality material. Material has good cushion, design and colors are super cute and toys are entertaining and the vibrating thing works perfect, not too much nor too little. I like the cushion bar because I can add other toys, seating is perfect. You will not be disappointed.",5,1
"Carters Super Soft Printed Changing Pad Cover, Blue",So soft and plush with very subtle polka dots. It is a very light blue and the picture is the perfect representation of the color. I love it!,5,1
"Carters Super Soft Printed Changing Pad Cover, Blue",This product was delivered promptly and was exactly the same as shown in the advertisement.  It will be perfect for my first grandchilds room.,5,1
"Winnie the Pooh &quot;Pooh Circles&quot; Small Diaper Bag - colors as shown, one size",Perfect size for what I need.  I wish the shoulder strap was longer but that is the only complaint I have.,4,1
Clay Handprint &amp; Footprint Keepsake Photo Wall Frame - Black,"So easy to do, and perfect memorable gift! Comes with even a carver, got for husbamds first fathers day gift!!! And I'll have to say it is my favorite photo frame! Going to get one for myself",5,1
"Trend Lab Dr. Seuss 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set, ABC",Great quality. Very soft and washes well.  I highly recomend this.  The colors are perfect for our sons nursery.  We love the ABC Dr.Seuss motif since it will grow well with our son from infant to toddler.,5,1
"Trend Lab Dr Seuss Diaper Stacker, ABC","I love that this matches my bedding perfectly. BUT, I use cloth diapers and the flimsy cardboard in the top section bent under the weight of only 12 diapers. I am replacing the cardboard with a piece of metal in order to keep my cute stacker, but I wish there was a piece of wood in there instead of cardboard.",4,1
Handmade Welcome Baby Ornament by Wendell August Forge,"I bought this as a present to my cousin as they got a baby girl on 27th of December-she was supposed to arrive on 15th:-). It is a really nice, unique present for the First Christmas. We really like it. As he has all baby stuff that they need, as he has 2 older boys, it was a perfect present.",5,1
BABYBJORN Smart Potty - Red,"This little potty is perfect for small spaces. It doesn't take up much room at all. It's just the right size. Very easy to clean. Stable and won't tip over. I would recommend this for anyone. It might be a little short if your child is very tall, but otherwise perfect.",5,1
"Trend Lab Dr Seuss ABC Toddler Bedding Set, 4 Piece","I bought this for my two year olds bedroom. I wanted something that could grow with him and not have to be replaced every year as he grew in and out of favorite characters.This set is perfect!! The colors are rich and vibrant and the comforter is really soft. The middle panel does pull in a bit when you wash it - this is NOT because of fabric shrinkage but because of the embrodiery. Embrodiery thread tends to shrink a it when it gets wet but if you tug gently at all four sides of the panel and then hang the comforter up to dry you will get rid of the bunching. Overall I'm THRILLED with our purchase, I will try to post a photo with the review later.",5,1
"Sassy Rattlin Rings, Blue/Black",We bought the Infantino Twist and Fold Activity Gym so we could do tummy time with our foster son and I decided to add a few toys. This works well and the colors are perfect for a baby that is only a couple weeks old.,5,1
"Sassy Rattlin Rings, Blue/Black","He LOVES looking, gripping and listening to this rattle!  The small beads make it the perfect sound.  The black and white contrast get his attention everytime.  He usually falls asleep with it around his arm.  LOVE this!!",5,1
"Sassy Ring and Phone Rattle, Blue",I bought this for my baby daughter for stocking stuffers. She was only 2 mo old and once she started hanging on to toys she really loved these! The colors are bright and contrastive. The handles are but perfect for even the tiniest of hands!,5,1
PlayTray for the Stokke Tripp Trapp  - Transparent,"I was very impressed when I received the play tray in the mail as it was much heavier, very sturdy and thicker then I antcipated.I have the original Tripp Trapp high chair with the European style infant seat attached and it fit perfectly over the infant insert.  This play tray also has a rectangular metal bar attched underneath and comes with a black strap so you can anchor the play tray to the high chair without the infant seat attched and the strap will go between the childs leggs to keep them from sliding out.I have been using my play tray for a month now with my 9 month old in the infant insert and love it.  I can let him make a mess while eating the simply slide the play tray off and throw the food in the bin and wash the tray properly and slide it back on.For more information this is the website of the company that makes the play tray:[....]",5,1
"Trend Lab Dr. Seuss Storage Bin, ABC, Medium",This was perfect for storing stuff in my Dr. Seuss Nursery. Great neutral theme and this was a wonderful addition.,5,1
"Carter's Snuggle Me Pink with Polka Dots 2-pack of Loveys, Security Blankets","My daughter was given these for her shower.  Honestly, I thought they were very strange since they're about the size of a burp cloth.  When I gave them to my daughter at about 3 months to go to bed with, she loved them!  They're the perfect size and very soft.  We needed more since it became a must have for bedtime.",5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","Perfect for teething and training toothbrush!  No worries about baby choking or gagging on it.  Saw one similar at local retail store, but glad I purchased this one instead!",5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","he's been using this banana since he's 3 months, perfect for his little hands, doesn't choke, perfect for his gums.",5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","My baby is almost 4 months and is just starting the teething process (no tooth buds yet, just getting &#34;chewy&#34;, drooly, and fussy).  He can grab things, but he's certainly not that coordinated yet, so the teething rings that require you to grab 2 sides and bring a middle section to your mouth or something don't really work for him yet.  He really just likes to grasp his fists together and bring them to his mouth.  So this thing is PERFECT!!  It is small and light enough for an early teether to manage and the grasps are close together so he can hold it while using his instinct to just bring both hands to his mouth.  He really likes the feeling of the rubber bristles on his gums and just chomps away on it.  It is also an easy transition because the shape is reminiscent of a pacifier.  In fact he will suck on it too when he just wants a comfort instead of rubbing his gums.  Totally a must have!!",5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",Bought this for my 3-month-old... it's perfect for establishing good habits before their teeth have come in!  She loves brushing time.,5,1
Bloom Alma Mattress Protector Natural Wheat,"I love Bloom products- and to protect your investment, you must buy this mattress pad. Thankfully, it works perfectly, is eco-friendly and I'd use it on her regular crib - if they made them in that size. :)",5,1
"Label Itz Bandette Cup and Bottle Labels, Zoo Animals",I needed something to mark which bottles were my 8mo daughters when I took her to nursery.  These work perfectly and are so affordable!!  We use with Born Free bottles.,5,1
"Dreambaby Retractable Gate, White",This gate has been perfect for our hard to fit stairway.  We have had it for over a year now and it has stood up well.  I especially like that it is out of the way when we do not need it.  I would buy this product again in a heartbeat.,5,1
"Dreambaby Retractable Gate, White",My In-laws have wide doorways and we needed a way to keep the kids away from the stairs. Neither kid can get it open but its not hard for grown ups. It withstands a lot of abuse from the kids. We looked for a long time and this was the perfect solution.,5,1
"Mommy's Helper Step Up Non-Slip Stepstool Froggie Collection, Green","Nice bright color, perfect for a 2 year old. The price was also very decent, I know my daughter (who loves to climb on things) will love this. Seems sturdy enough.",5,1
"Mommy's Helper Step Up Non-Slip Stepstool Froggie Collection, Green",It is the perfect size for him to carry around and safely stand on!  I would recommend this product to anyone.,5,1
"Luvable Friends Thanksgiving Drooler Bib, Thanksgiving",Very cute and the smaller size is perfect for a newborn!  It also has a decent thickness to it and the price is right!,4,1
"North American Bear Company Smushy Bear, Pink, Large","I was looking for the perfect bear to take weekly pictures with my daughter showing how much she has grown in her first year. This bear is PERFECT! It's big enough, while not being too big. It's also very soft and will be a great keepsake as she grows up. If I have any more children, I will buy this same bear for them too. Highly recommended for any parents who want a photographic record of their baby's growth.",5,1
"Nuby 2 Pack Nurtur Care Infa Feeder Set, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary",I looked for these in every store and finally found them on here after I was told they dont even make them anymore. They got here sooner than anticipated.  They were in perfect condition. They cost more than I expected them to but they were so worth it.,5,1
"Badger Basket Lightweight Three Drawer Hamper/Storage Unit, Brown Dot","got this for mudroom to hold gloves, hats, sunscreen, etc.  Not super sturdy, as you may expect, but perfect for what I needed it for.  Very easy to put together.  I got the light blue, color looks as shown.  Just what I was looking for.  It looks so much better than those carts with plastic drawers!",4,1
"Badger Basket Lightweight Three Drawer Hamper/Storage Unit, Brown Dot","i dont have any dressers because i hang up most of my stuff or put it on shelves, so i just needed something small to hold my socks and undies, and this was perfect for that. it's easy to assemble. one of the parts malfunctioned (the hole where the screw goes into came out in the bottom front horizontal bar; i still put the thing together) but its very easy to order replacement parts from the manufacturers website. it not super sturdy, but im not putting it through any type of rugged usage, so its durable enough for me. probably the most disappointing thing is the baby blue color. in amazon's pic it is bright and looks fun, but in real life the baby blue is sort of dull and boring. and if youre a grown man like me, people may make fun of you and say ""thats for a baby!"" whatever.",4,1
NoJo 2 Pack Dot Changing Table Cover - Ivory withSnow Dots,"It's nice to have a bunch of changing pad covers on hand, and they certainly don't have to be great quality...  These are not impressive quality.  Pretty cheaply made, but they function perfectly well.  They won't last you forever, but they're cost-effective and cute enough.  They're poop catchers.  You don't need fancy.",4,1
NoJo 2 Pack Dot Changing Table Cover - Ivory withSnow Dots,I was so pleased with these covers for the value of two for the price of one! Every store I went to the pad covers cost at least $12.99 or more for only one cover and most of those were plain looking. I even had trouble just finding them at some stores. The Nojo covers fit my pad perfectly and washing them was a snap! I would recommend these to anyone who enjoys style for a great value!,5,1
"American Baby Company Full Size  30&quot; X  40&quot; - 100% Cotton Thermal Blanket, Blue","This blanket is soft, stretchy, and warm but lightweight. I love the color and it is actually great for swaddling! It was perfect for my newborn, but seems a bit small for her now. Great price, great purchase!!",5,1
Dreambaby Toy Chain,"This isn't really a TOY to speak of; it's a hanger for stuffed animals.  It's perfect because it comes with the hook to hang it, a really long chain so no matter how tall your ceilings are it should work fine, AND there were lots of clips for the animals.  I bought three; one for my daughter who is expecting, and two for our Thrift Shop so that we could hang up all the stuffed animals that are for sale.  It takes up so little room yet allows you to see everything at a glance.  GREAT for cleaning up baby's room or decluttering your teenager's place!",5,1
"Serena &amp; Lily Deluxe Peacock Diaper Tote, Army Green","It would take me too long to describe how much I like this bag.  I have been on the road for almost 6months with my toddler and baby, and it has gone everywhere with me!  It is fashionable and practical in equal measure.  Yet it is not flashy, (no one will tell how much you have paid for it), and here in South America, I find that a great advantage!!  Before buying it I looked all over for pictures of the inside, couldn't find them!! But it has all the pockets I need, even a little protecting pouch for the buckle once you are ready to toss the bag in the washer!!, two perfectly sized for diapers, two for bottles, one for clean clothes, two more for extras.  I just love it.  The color is a beautiful military green that goes with (almost) everything, esp. well with our Eddie Bauer stroller.  I was worried about it not having a zipper closure, and even thought I might want to have one put on, but so far it hasn't been an issue, not once have I dropped a single bib/sock/toy in it.  Trust me it is worth every penny!!!  Thanks Serena & Lily for crafting such high quality product!!",5,1
"L A Baby Cocoon Organic Changing Pad, Gold, 32&quot;","I always read the reviews of products before I purchase an item. I read the reviews for this product which stated the following problems: torn seam, bunched up inner cotton batting, odd chemical smell, unable to find size appropriate covers and fabric not as shown on amazon (which also included a pic of what the fabric did look like). I then found this item for a discounted price ($20.15 due to open box...most likely a returned product) and because I liked the jaquard pattern and color another customer photo had shown (matches our nursery theme perfectly) decided I was willing to chance the problems. I placed the order on June 20 and received it on June 22. That was the free super saver shipping and NOT two day shipping so I was highly impressed that I received it so quickly. Upon opening the product I did indeed find that the inner cotton batting was bunched up at one end of the mat under the jaquard cover (which was as the cutomer photo had depicted). I also noted that there was a small opening about an inch long in the seam at the bottom corner of one end (this was not a tear but simply where the thread was unravelling). I used this to my advantage and picked out the threading along the entire end. I was then able to reach under the jaquard cover and straighten out the quilted cotton batting and then resewed the end securely. This entire process took me about 1/2 an hour. If I had not been able to repair the problem myself in such a short period of time it would not have been worth it, but any novice seamstress will find that this problem is easily fixed. It is a really nice changing pad both visually and functionally. This is a larger pad but I wanted a larger one so that it could be used for a longer duration. You can find covers to fit it using most any search engine including the length in your search. However, the product already has a cover on it (the jaquard fabric). It is not washable, but you only need to purchase waterproof pads which are much cheaper than a cover anyways. Finally, I did not notice any sort of odd chemical smell coming from this product. That was actually the first thing I checked for as such a thing would have caused me to immediately return it. Overall, given that I was able to fix the minor problems with this product, purchased it at a reduced price and received it so quickly I gave it 4 stars. I would not recommend this product to someone who has no sewing skills or does not know someone who could do the repairs for them as given the other reviews it is likely that the product will need some alterations.",4,1
"Dandelion Organic Plush Toy, Bear","Just the cutest little addition to the nursery. Finding organic plush toys aren't always easy, and when you do they often look very &#34;earthy&#34; if you know what I mean. He's on the smaller side for a teddy bear (I don't think I really noted the dimensions when I ordered) but perfect for little hands.",5,1
"Prince Lionheart Corner Guards, Chocolate Brown","These corners were perfect for the sharp edges on my platform bed.  Also, my husband was concerned that they would damage the finish but the adhesive is by 3M and it says to just use vegetable oil to take it off of wood, so it sounds pretty easy.",5,1

"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Brick Red","This stroller is perfect for a family on the go. Folds easily. comfy seat. great tray. rides over grass and pavement great. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is that the cupholder tray by the handle is not deep enough. If you hit a slight bump, the sippy cup/bottle will fall out.",4,1

"Baby Banz Hearing Protector Earmuffs, Blue","This item works perfect. I've even put them on and tried them myself. Keeps noise out, great for plane rides. The baby doesn't seem bothered by wearing them, so I feel they are comfortable enough for her. I would recommend these earmuffs if you are trying to reduce noise for your baby",5,1
"Baby Banz Hearing Protector Earmuffs, Blue","My girls use these while drumming with daddy.  They fit and work perfectly for our girls ages 4, 6, 8, and 11.",5,1
"Peg-Perego Primo Viaggio Infant Car Seat, Java",We are repeat customers of Peg Perego because their quality and safety is exceptional. We LOVE this seat! Love that it's made of extremely high quality materials from Italy (NOT CHINA). My baby fit perfectly into this seat without any unsafe additions even when she was 6 lbs at birth. This is our second Peg Perego infant seat because we love them so much.,5,1
"Disney Baby Fairy Tale Dreams Cuddle Plush Blanket, Pink/White",these are so plushy and so cute perfect for baby girls.....1 left on stock and gladly made it.....baby lilah on it[...],5,1
"Peg-Perego Aria Twin Stroller, Java","I was so excited to get the stroller in the mail. The overall look of coarse is nice, I even received a compliment the very first day. it is easier to push around than my baby trend snap and go, being that my twins are 9months now and about 20lbs. The problem that I noticed immediately after putting the twins inside was the straps. These pop off from the back harness so easily. Now it does allow for them to move freely, but the babies were all over each other. Ever time I would attach the back harness strap, it would detach as soon as they leaned forward. I do like that the seats recline up and down, love the java color, and the sun protectors for babies. I know there is no perfect stroller but I just wish the straps would stay put when I want to secure my littles from each other. Maybe it will get better as they get older:) hope this is helpful..",4,1
Anastasia 4 in 1&nbsp; Convertible Crib,"Just recieved this crib today, was kinda worried from some of the other reviews about scratches, dents, etc. But it came in perfect condition, was packed very well, took about 2 hrs to put together, and is very sturdy and well worth the money, if you follow the instructions you shouldn't have any problems. But overall, it is gorgeous and I definetely recommend this crib. :-))",5,1
"Davinci Jenny Lind 3-in-1 Convertible Crib, Cherry","I had been searching for months for a vintage style crib that would suit both a boy or a girl since we were having a delivery surprise.  We purchased a Davinci Kalani crib and dresser for my son 4 years ago and the qualtiy is fantastic.  When I came across the Jenny Lind crib for such an incredible price, I knew I found the perfect crib.  It is super sturdy.  The paint job is fantastic and it took us hardly any time to put it together.  It is the focal point of the nursery and I could not be happier with our purchase.  I highly recommend this crib.",5,1
PumpEase Classic Collection hands-free pumping bra - Verry Cherry - M,"I just purchased the PumpEase bra and received it within 2 days thanks to Amazon Prime! Used it for the first time this morning and it is comfortable, easy to put on, and hands-free through the entire pumping session. I have larger breasts so I was skeptical that it could hold the flanges and bottles that are full of milk by the end. Another added bonus - I got about 25% more milk than I normally get. This may be a fluke but it is probably because the flanges are perfectly positioned using the PumpEase, and do not move throughout the pumping process like they would if I was holding them. I followed the size chart and it fits true to size.",5,1
"Trend Lab 2 Piece Dr. Seuss Frame Set, ABC","one picture frame was perfect, the other one had some blue paint on the white part and some blue paint  on the green stripes. Other than that they are great. I dont think anyone will notice the paint on the one frame unless they really look at it up close.",4,1
"Trend Lab 2 Piece Dr. Seuss Frame Set, ABC","These picture frames are super cute on the website, but they look even better in person!  The colors are so bright, and the quality is excellent!  Also, they are much bigger than I expected (I probably just failed to notice the dimensions online before I bought them), and they'll actually each hold a standard 4x6 photo!  These are going to look PERFECT in my son's room!",5,1
Boba 2G Baby Carrier - Chestnut,"The Boba is a soft-structured carrier (think Ergo) designed to be used for children ages 1 to 4 (15 - 45 lbs.) for front and back carries, and my two youngest are now 16 months and 3.5.  As an Ergo owner my first thoughts were - how does the Boba differ from an Ergo?  Well, to be honest there are quite a few points of differentiation, most good, some not-so-good.  There are also some similarities and challenges that seem to present themselves with any structured carrier.So, first off, the Boba is an organic cotton carrier, made in Boulder, Colarado by mountaineering professionals - very neat!  The first things I noticed were the nicely contoured padded shoulder straps, the handy `hide-em' elastics to roll up the excess webbing from the shoulder straps and waist strap (very nice touch!), and the heavy duty safety-buckle.Loading both of my children in the front facing position was very simple, but I did need some help fastening the chest-strap across my back (I have limited mobility in my right arm), so I need some help there.  I played with the foot-straps some before realizing that my baby's legs are just too short for them to work at the moment, but they are very adjustable with a neat sliding feature that let's you move them around the bottom of the carrier.  Adjusting for circumference is tricker, as they velcro up inside of the padded waist area, which is securely fastened when you have a child in the carrier and are trying to adjust the straps.  The front carry with Sarah is blissful, it's the snuggliest, worry-free front carry ever!  She's in the perfect position to kiss, and the extra fabric on the sides and top really gives it a cocoon-like feel.  She slept for hours in the Boba the first time she rode in it.Now, the shoulder straps were hard for me to get snug enough, so I called in my husband, but this isn't unique to the Boba, I always have a hard time with this design of tightening fixture on soft-structure carriers.  Once adjusted though, between the shoulder and chest straps you can get a good custom-fit for your child.  It does take a few minutes to adjust the carrier back and forth for different children.Now, my 3.5 year old IS tall enough to get use out of the foot-straps!  Designed to be used with shoes, the straps function almost as a stirrup, and are designed to lift the leg to a healthy, 90 degree angle from hip to thigh and thigh to calf.  I think it's a pretty neat idea, and you can tell that the posture is definitely better with the strap as opposed to without.  If she gets excited and tries to 'stand' in the stirrups, the velcro lets loose and needs to be done up again, and she did say they were a bit `itchy' - some of the velcro must have brushed her leg (something to note if your youngster has sensory-integration issues).  Again the front carry is very supportive and incredibly comfy, I could carry her for hours like this!  She likes it too  .Now, for the back carry, I actually got Sarah in without help on my first try by following the instructions!  The extra fabric on the panel really makes a difference here.  With other soft-structured carriers I often felt like my baby was leaning away from me because I couldn't feel her upper body against my back.  With the Boba that problem is no longer there!  With some careful adjustments I can get my little girl hugged up nice and comfy. I REALLY like this...sure helps when I'm doing dishes!Rose also gets nice and tight up against me as you can see. Now, with her being heavier I did notice that the unpadded webbing that makes up the front portion of the Boba (where you fasten the safety buckle) carries more weight and did dig into my abdomen some.  That's likely due to my squishy mommy belly, but it wasn't entirely comfortable.  Some other carriers feature a flat band of fabric that goes underneath this section of webbing to distribute the weight without so much digging, but the Boba doesn't. Thankfully, I don't use a carrier with her often, as I'm the only carrier wearer in the family, so I usually take Sarah.  If Rosie tuckers out her Dad uses his arms  .The Boba also doesn't have a sleeping baby head flap, but in truth, I've rarely been able to fasten those by myself with a baby in the carrier, and often it woke mine up.  With the extra fabric providing upper-back support, Sarah just tucked herself in closer when she fell asleep in the front carry, so I haven't missed it yet.With both the back and front carries high, snug, and secure, the Boba is a great carrier for moms who want to wear their babies through the winter with a baby-wearing coat.  Once you get your adjustments made you're ready to go, there won't be any budging.Parents shopping for a first soft-structured baby carrier should STRONGLY consider the Boba due to the extra fabric in the panel ALONE.  The added feeling of security is so sweet, snuggly, and above all reassuring!",5,1
"GEENNY Boutique Crib Bedding Set, Beautiful Amazon Jungle Animals, 13 Piece","This is an adorable set!  We had an &#34;outdoorsy&#34; room that we didn't want to have to change too much, but finding something colorful, but also gender neutral that was still cute for a girl was difficult. The sheet is a little bit thin, but the set is otherwise perfect. The sheet has monkeys all over it. The colors are nice and vivid and it looks great in our &#34;outdoorsy&#34; room. You can pick severeral great colors to painting the walls from that taupy gold, to brown, to blue, to green, to the rose/burgundy color as well as just leaving the walls neutral. Plus it has several different animals that you can work with. Perfect!",4,1
"Fisher-Price Precious Planet Large Character Hooded Towel, Lion","It's very cute, but the hood was too big for newborn. We just recently used it when our baby is around 5-month old...the hood fits perfectly now.",4,1
"Sassy Soft Spout Tub Guard, Green","This little guy is too cute and my son loves him!Perfect and inexpensive way to guard your tub faucet.  Though my son knows he may not touch the actual tub facuet, I still use this guy just in case and my son loves it!",5,1
"Sassy Baby Food Nurser, Colors May Vary","now that I have got the hang of it and just push food into the nipple before feeding then leave it alone and let gravity take over I am having faster feeding times. perfectly clean now that the baby is used to it. so glad his food is getting into his tummy now instead of dripping down his chin and on bibs, and me! It takes a few tries to get it right, but I do suggest soeaking and hand washing. too many parts, one could easily melt in the bottom of the dishwasher. i recommend this product to all",5,1
"Sassy Baby Food Nurser, Colors May Vary",The Sassy baby food nurser is perfect to feed your little one baby food or cereal who hasn't quite mastered the spoon yet OR you don't have the option of feeding them with a spoon at the moment they want food.  My son is 5 1/2 months old and we have been using these for a little over a month.  Before we could only thicken up his milk a little with rice cereal.  Once we received these we were able to actually give him some real baby food and he actually started sleeping through the night!  so for that I LOVE these nursers.  Only negative I have to say is if you push too hard on the bottom the food will leak through but that doesn't happen with proper use :),4,1
RAZ-A-DAZZLE SILICONE TOOTHBRUSH 2 PACK,Love this toothbrush for very young little ones!  My two year old grandson bit the end off of one on the very first day we received them so I hesitate to suggest for very old teething toddlers!!  But it is very soft and made perfectly for chewing on if you don't have a BRUTE teether!,4,1
Trend Lab 30041 CRIB SHEET - DR. SEUSS CAT IN THE HAT,this crib sheet had the bright cat pattern that isnt over the top. we did our nursery as a cat in the hat theme since we are keeping the gender of the baby a surprise so needed something neutral. it fit our standard serta crib mattress perfect and doesnt slide at all. you really have to see this pattern in person to appreciate it.,5,1
"Graco Travel Lite Crib with Bassinet, Barcelona Bluegrass","Bought this travel lit crib after a friend recommend using a co-sleeper to keep baby close to you during the first few months. The husband and I actually went to Babies R Us to check out how it looks and feels first before purchasing. BRU sales the travel lite crib for $90 (different style - more unisex), I bought this one on Amazon for $67 (before they increased the price to $80 now). Still affordable compare to the Arm's Reach bassinet that my friend used. The Arms Reach (my friend highly recommends it) is around $140 but that can only be used for bassinet. This travel lite crib is fold-able (comes with a carrying bag) and easy to assemble. It's light enough to drag on the 2 wheels to different rooms. It's compact enough for bassinet use. Can be lowered to 2 other levels and eventually used as a pack n play later. I love things that are multi-use. This surely fits the bill.Cons:1) No instruction manual in the box - I think I have to d/l one online - esp to figure out how to lower to the 2nd level and the lower level2) the bassinet pad that comes with the lite crib doesn't feel that comfortable. I ended up buying a separate bassinet pad (Summer Infant brand - $19) that fits perfectly on top of this manufactured pad. They sell that at BRU. I think it's 30X19. There are no sheets that fit the size though at BRU. Better off buying a bigger size sheet and tug that underneath the bassinet pad. I would recommend buying the additional padding if you are using it as co-sleeper for your baby. The baby deserves to sleep comfortably too!Overall, the product looks and feels sturdy. Hopefully it holds up after the baby sleeps on there for a while.",4,1
"Graco Travel Lite Crib with Bassinet, Ally","We recieved this pack & play as a gift from our baby shower, its is adorable! We got it in the grey/pink color (other colors are avai) & its very nice. We like how it has the bassinet part at the top for when baby is little. The little canopy adds a cute touch! We travel alot so this will be her bed on the road! It is made well, easy to put together & take apart. The pink ruffles on it adds a cute girly touch! Perfect for a girly girl!Great buy & well worth it!",5,1
"Graco Blossom Booster Seat, Brown/Tan","I bought this for my 3 yo grand daughter and she loves it. She had outgrown her highchair and was still to small to sit in anadult chair with the proper height to eat so this is the perfect solution. She likes it better without the back but it is very well built, straps are long and easy to use. Nice washable surface. I will keep it for my newborn granddaughter when she needs it.This is a must have and is light and small enough to carry  with you to restaurants, or family's homes.",5,1
"Graco Blossom Booster Seat, Brown/Tan","Our little one started refusing to get in the high chair for meals. So, we thought it was time to move up to a booster seat. We wanted just a straight-forward booster seat - not another high chair & tray, etc. that attaches to a dining room chair. This booster seat fit what we wanted perfectly. We have padded dining room chairs and it attached just fine with one strap around the back of the chair and one that runs under the seat. With a wiggly toddler, I would suggest checking & tightening up the straps regularly to keep the chair secure. I also really like that the seat back has two different positions (closer to the front of the seat or a couple inches further back) or can be removed entirely when your child is bigger. The seat back also has a 3 point safety harness for around the waist & between the legs. So, far it has held secure even when our toddler has wiggled around and leaned forward all the way. We've been using this booster for a few months so far and it has worked out perfectly for us. I also love that it is so easy to remove & take with us when traveling to family events. This booster is just right for our little one!",5,1
"Graco Blossom Booster Seat, Brown/Tan","I was looking into different brands. I wanted something that fits well on most type of kitchen chairs and can be secured to them, so it won't fall off with my ever-wiggling toddler girl. The stripes are long enough to secure the seat to boarder chairs as well as to the basic IKEA kitchen chairs. Easy to assemble and dissemble, maybe not the most perfect one when it comes to fitting it in the trunk, but not the worst one either.We've been using this seat for over a month now, tested it on several kind of chairs and are satisfied with it so far. It was worth the price.",5,1
"Graco Blossom Booster Seat, Brown/Tan","These are wonderful!  I have 2 1/2 year old twins, and I was looking for something to use instead of the highchairs that cluttered our small kitchen.  These fit easily under our table, sit them at a perfect height to the table, and make them feel like &#34;big kids&#34; because the are eating off the table and can get in and out by themselves.  The back lifts right off for easy cleaning...great as my daughter is a VERY messy eater!  My only complaint (and it is VERY small) is the seatbelt hooks to the back which, while great for cleaning, can make them a little hard to fasten.  If you have a squirmer, they may not work well for you, but we often don't use them, so it hasn't been much of an issue for us.  The price was great too.  When you are buying 2 of everything, price is an issue...and these were a great value.",5,1
"Graco Blossom Booster Seat, Brown/Tan","Perfect booster for our toddler.Now she can see and eat her food better, and we finally got rid of the space-taking high chair.Will recommend to our friends.",5,1
"Evenflo Cozy Sleeves - 4 oz - 1 pk, Girl Color",I was very pleased to see the item arrive in just a few days.  I was worried if the item would fit the bottles and if my daughter would be able to put it on the bottles easily.  It fit the bottle perfectly and she did get it on the bottle without a struggle.  She was also amazed how she had a better grip on the glass bottle.,5,1
"JJ Cole Swag Diaper Bag, Silver Drop","This diaper bag is PERFECT!!!! There are a lot of pockets on the outside and inside. The outside pockets makes it easy to access items such as pacifiers and sippy cups. I love that there are little metal ""feet"" on the bottom of the bag. The back panel where the changing pad goes is perfect. Big enough for wide items and books. The side pockets are insulated and is perfect for bottles or sippy cups. I love how the strap can be converted in length, so I can wear it cross body or sling it over a stroller. The bag does come with stroller straps!!!! which works perfectly and very versatile. I think it is a perfect size....not to big or too small...enough to hold necessities like diapers, burp cloth, change of clothes, toys...and not be too overwhelming. I can wear it out shopping and walking about. It also comes with a little zip purse that you can store keys or small items and clips into the bag. Easy clean fabric inside and out. LOVE IT!!!!",5,1
Elmo Travel Tray,I ordered this travel tray for my 18 mth old when we took her on her first real vacation( 9 hr car ride). This item shipped quickly from the seller (2 days) and completely met out expectations. It's made of rigid foam so its light weight and easy to pack without being flimsy. It was perfect for coloring and lunch on the go. She's totally in love with Elmo so that helped as well and the pockets were great for hiding the binky for quick access.,5,1
"Toofeze Baby Teether/Soother, Green","I bought Toofeze for my then 6mo old son. It was perfect for his little hands to hold on to. Not a choking hazard, or a gross teether filled with liquid! Chill it with a touch of cold water and all set! Instant relief... My son is now almost two and with those molars coming in, we never go anywhere without our toofeze! You might think $20 is too much for a teether, it's worth every penny! It's durable, not cheaply made like other teethers! Try it! You'll see!",5,1
"Safety 1st OnBoard 35 Adjustable Infant Car Seat Base, Black","This base fits our Safety 1st on board 35 car seat perfectly!  It was a great price, and it's nice to have an extra base in my husband's vehicle as well as mine.  The carrier audibly clicks into place, so you know it's secured.  I would definitely recommend this to others!",5,1
"Safety 1st OnBoard 35 Adjustable Infant Car Seat Base, Black",I couldn't find an eddie bauer car seat base and this worked perfectly!!!! It matches my eddie bauer car seat base and fits the car seat wonderfully.,5,1
"Safety 1st OnBoard 35 Adjustable Infant Car Seat Base, Black",I struggled to find a second base that went with my Eddie Bauer Stroller as it's not made by Eddie Bauer!  This is a Safety First base and it's identical to the one that comes with the stroller.  So if you've been struggling as well...look no longer!  Works perfect!,5,1
"JJ Cole Collections Receiving Blanket, Primary Rings",Love these blankets - we have 2! I just love the colors and designs of them! The size is perfect for swaddling and they're thick enough to keep the baby warm. Would buy again.,5,1
Sesame Street Elmo Fleece Throw Blanket and Buddy Set,"I gave this to my two year old neice for her birthday. She loved it. The blanket was the perfect size for a toddler. She carried around the Elmo even though it doesn't seem to have a purpose beyond holding the blanket, she loved it.",5,1
"MAM Bite and Brush Teether, 3 Months, Colors May Vary","My 7 month old loves this thing. I may have to get another in order to have spare. Its a simple design, BPA_free easy to clean and my baby loves it.The perfect teether.",5,1
Gay Pride Short Sleeve Infant Creeper &quot; My Mommies Love Me &quot; (NB),I bought this for a gift and the color was vibrant and the design was perfectly placed! They loved it!!!,5,1
"Carters Quilted Woven Playard Fitted Sheet, Animal","It fits my chicco lullaby magic playard perfectly even after a wash. The graphics on it is really cute and the sheet has a quilted pattern that adds some softness and thickness to the mattress pad of the playard. I washed the sheet in the washer and put it for drying in the dryer for only about 3-4 mins after which I line dried this sheet. I think this helps to keep the fabric soft, prevents it from shrinking and the sunlight for drying acts as an excellent disinfectant (because of the UV rays). overall, I am very happy with this purchase.",5,1
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow","I use this item on top of my change pad and am seriously in love. My baby has taken to peeing every so often when he's been freed from his diaper and every single time, no matter how much liquid he chooses to exude, the bassinet pad stands up to the test. The size is perfect for using on top of a change pad.",5,1
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow","I bought this for baby's stroller bassinet, in which she also sleeps at night. We cut it down to perfectly match the shape of the oval mattress, which it protected perfectly from the occasional mid-sleep diaper explosion. So happy with this purchase that we bought it in a bigger size to protect the crib.",5,1
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow","This is a great product, works perfect with the pack and play. I would highly recommend this. Washes up very nicely!",5,1
"Carters Keep Me Dry Water Resistant Flannel Crib Pad, White","This is not a fitted crib pad. It is exactly like the Keep Me Dry Bassinet Pads (which are awesome!) but it is larger, for a crib. It is about 6 or so inches shorter than an actual standard mattress but it is still perfect for us. The width is just fine. My baby has severe reflux and she is getting too squirmy to place cloth diapers under her head anymore, she wiggles her way ALL around her crib now. I was changing her sheets every day. Fighting with the bumper irritated me. These are perfect; heavy enough to stay put, soft to have next to her skin, easy to change, keep spit up from soaking through, and hold up well in the wash. I also bought the keep me dry fitted pad and use it under her sheet. So in case she ever pulls up the first pad, her mattress will be protected. I am soooo happy with these, any other parents dealing with reflux know what hell changing outfits and bibs so often can be, this extra little convenience saves my sanity :)",5,1
"Carters Velour Playard Fitted Sheet, Ecru",Love how soft this sheet is and it fits our pack and play perfectly.  Our toddler wouldn't sleep in the pack n play until we got this sheet then she slept great.  Perfect for use when we are on vacation.,5,1
"Carters Velour Playard Fitted Sheet, Ecru",Fits my Bright Starts pack and play perfectly and I was worried about that.  Now when my grandson comes to visit he is very comfortable.  No shrinkage but I did wash in cold water.,5,1
"Carters Velour Playard Fitted Sheet, Ecru",I bought this for my Chicco Rattania playard and it fits perfectly.  I especially love the soft velour fabric - it's thicker than a regular sheet too.,5,1
"Kissaluvs Organic Cotton/Hemp Fitted Diaper, Unbleached, Medium/Large 15-40lbs","So soft, cozy and fits perfectly.  Great for during the day or overnight with extra insert for my heavy wetter.  Goes great under wool covers (that's what I use).  I absolutely love this diaper and wish I could afford to buy a dozen more.",5,1
"Kissaluvs Cotton Fleece Hybrid One Size Contour Diaper, Unbleached","I started off wanting to exclusively use one type of cloth diaper (gDiapers) but quickly found out that, since babies come in all different shapes and sizes, not all cloth diaper solutions work for every baby in every situation.These diapers say they are for babies from about 7lbs to 35lbs and I would say that is probably perfect although we are only about 13lbs so I can't speak to the top end.  As far as the small end, I actually prefer this diaper for the smaller babes because you dont have to mess with snaps and you can adjust the rise to exactly what you need by folding the front down.  I would think that by the time you got up into 30 lbs however, it would pretty much be a shell to hold soakers as there is no way this would be enough absorbency for a toddler.There is a attached long soaker that can be folded in half for smaller babes.  this is enough wetness for average wetters and overnight for small babes.  I currently am using this on 12lb 3 month old twins for overnight use and it works but if left on much over 8 hours we start gambling with leaks.I started using these with my twin girls when I was looking for an overnight solution that would allow me to go 4 hours between diaper changes without leaks. They were about 7-8 lbs at this time and very tall and skinny. This snugged right up without leaving any marks and we haven't had any leaks unless it was left on too long.I was not sure how I felt about the no faster situation but I actually like it.  I use a Snappi fastener with it an I can make very precise adjustments because I am not limited by snaps or velcro.  This actually would allow for the diaper to be used on a slightly smaller baby if needed but there is some bulk once the front is folded down.We have used these with Econobum covers, Rumparooz and Thirsties size 1 covers as well as wool and they make a great system.For those having problems with absorbency, the problem is likely in cloth diapering basics: you must prep (wash) the diaper and insert about 6 times before use. Wash with twice the water and half the detergent and pre and post rinse. As your baby gets into the 15+ lbs arena, however, especially if they are heavy wetters, you may want to add a doubler especially for overnight.  And remember this is a FITTED diaper and MUST be used with a COVER (plastic or wool) at all times!Bottom Line: Decent diaper that will fit through a variety of sizes, often will work as an overnight solutionPros: Decent absorbency as-is especially in the smaller sizes, almost unlimited size adjustment, will definitely fit from birth to PTCons: Will need doublers for absorbency as your babe hits the midway mark",4,1
"Dream On Me / Mia Moda  Atmosferra Stroller, Nero","I love this stroller SO much! I am not afraid to say that this is a PERFECT stroller. people are too idealistic and unrealistic at times. If you look at what really matters --this stroller Wont dissapoint. Good seat size, easy fold, big basket, parent pocket and cup holder, reversable seat, bassinet feauture, adjustable seat and footrest, and so much other great things!I just got it a week ago and am still pregnant but I had my niece (3.5 years) and my nephew (9 months) over to test out the stroller. My nephew is pretty big but he fit perfectly with room to spare. He was even able to fully recline if he wanted to nap. He looked very comfortable and loved being in the stroller. My niece whose a toddler also fit. She couldn't lay back but at 3.5 years old she pretty much doesn't need a stroller anymore. I just wanted to see if she would be able to fit which she could! She also loved it and asked to sit it in for a while! So I would definitely disagree with everyone saying that this stroller seat is too small. If you get to have a child from infant to three years old in there-- that stroller has done its job.Another thing I saw a lot of parents complaining about was the difficult fold. The fold is not difficult! Just because you have to put in TWO minutes to learn how to do it doesn't mean it's difficult. I think people just expect things to be as easy as pushing one button. I didn't mind learning how to close it and it take 10 seconds to do so once you learn. The open is also quick taking about 5 seconds. The whole thing is just awesome. I can't have any complaints about it.About the size--yes it's biggish but it's a stroller!! If you are getting a stroller expect it to take up a good chunk of your trunk. It's not going to be tiny.. If it was tiny wouldn't you question the stability of it? I'm glad it has some size because I know it is strong and will hold up. I have a Hyndai Elantra and it fits fine in my trunk. I could still fit groceries in my trunk if I needed. No complaints here. If your car is REALLY small the you have the option of removing the seat too. I would consider that a plus! It's versatile to fit different spaces.I will reiterate what others have said about the basket, reverse feature, cup holders etc. they are all GREAT feautures. They seriously add so much to the stroller. The stroller looks expensive and has expensive features. The color is amazing and it just looks so modern. I am not of fan of the cutesy animal prints and patterns. This stroller is clean and simple looking.I am in love with every bit of this stroller! Can't wait to use it with my baby in a couple of months!!",5,1
"NoJo Froggy Friends Four Piece Crib Set, Brown/Green","I am a grandma who was looking for some cute bedding for a crib that stays at my house for my grandchildren to use when they visit.  This was just perfect!!  It was a good value for the money.  The quality is good, and it is also appropriate for either a baby boy or a baby girl.  I would definitely recommend this bedding.",5,1

"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple, 10 Ounce",My daughter has been using this everyday for school and it works just as promised.  Her milk stays cold and it has never once leaked.  It holds the perfect amount of liquid and fits into her lunchbox easily.  It is simple to assemble and a breeze to wash.  We both love it!,5,1
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple, 10 Ounce","I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a water cup for their little ones. My two year old is not able to push the button to open the lid quite yet, but she can if she really tries and pushes. The flow from the straw is great, easy to clean and a very elegant looking cup at that. Perfect Thermos product!",5,1
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple, 10 Ounce","Very good, received what is perfect, my family and I all like it very much, will recommend to my friends next time",5,1
"Contours Options 3 Wheeler Stroller II, Cinnamon","I just sold mine (previous version w/ red canopy) at a garage sale- & really wish I hadn't.  Anyway, I used it with the seat facing me when baby was about 6-10 months and then flipped it forward.  This was the only stroller I could find that seats both directions.  When they're just starting to sit up on their own, this stroller is perfect!  Especially at this price. It seemed like our baby really wanted to be looking at me while she was riding at that age.  I don't think this is any bumpier or harder to push than our fancy jogging stroller. The plastic wheels are fine and practical, and you don't have to worry about flat tires!  The basket and solid parent tray are both generous sizes- you can carry quite a bit and everything's easily accessible! Also, when seat is forward facing, no danger of drink spilling on baby (even rear facing, baby's probably safe).  The canopy seemed to have good coverage. I really liked that the foot area was adjustable. The footprint is a little bigger than an umbrella stroller.  I think it's worth it to have both.  I would feel rude if I was shopping for clothes or in tight spaces with this thing, because it is a bit bigger. When you have the seat facing backwards, you have to separate it to fold it up- but this is not hard to do, and for the price point is a really minor thing.  I looked forever for rear facing strollers, there are just not that many out there, and the price starts sky rocketing pretty quickly.  This one was really awesome, and had great re-sale value, too!",5,1
"Contours Options 3 Wheeler Stroller II, Cinnamon","I purchased this for only $100 which was a steal. I had some reservatoins due to other reviews, but I was positively surprised. I've had it for 2 yrs now, and everything is still working fine on it. the tires are great, easy to manoeuver. the fact that it's convertible (from infant car seat, to toddler) makes it worth every penny. my daughter is taller than average, but she still fits in it perfect. but I dont think she'll fit in as well at age 3. but that's ok because she has a sister now and I'm getting ready to buy a double stroller.",5,1
"ERGObaby Original Doll Carrier, Galaxy Grey",This carrier is the perfect size for 6-12 year olds.  My daughter loves it and it is easy to put on.,5,1
"ERGObaby Original Doll Carrier, Galaxy Grey","Whatever did the oldest daughter do when the new baby arrived, before this ingenious, just like mom item? And the mom's reaction? Perfection! Of course this was AFTER we traded in the awful gray color (who was on THAT design team?) for a gorgeous replacement ""Mystic Purple."" Amazon faciliated the trade with a minimum of effort.",5,1
"ERGObaby Original Doll Carrier, Galaxy Grey","This ERGO is perfect for the little mommy at your house.  My daughter loves her baby doll (an American Girl Bitty Baby) and had been frustrated by other cheaply made carriers.  I even sewed one for her but she grew out of it.  This is made of high quality materials, is adjustable to the various size of your little one, and the purple color is fabulous.  We get stopped and asked about it all the time.  Baby Addy, the doll, seems very pleased.",5,1
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!","Yep, they're worth the hype.  These blankets are the best for swaddling, draping over car seats/strollers, covering floors/furniture, and even using as burp cloths.  They are light weight, but perfect for stuffing inside a car seat cover or Bundle Me for extra warmth.  Breathable, easy to roll up and toss in your diaper bag.  An absolute baby necessity.",5,1
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!","These blankets are perfect for summer. I love the design and they are of a high quality muslin. Very large, too. I would purchase these again. Very nice!",5,1
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!",These blankets are so great! They are so soft and really help my babies feel secure when I swaddle them. This past summer I used them to swaddle my twins and I didn't have to worry about them overheating and getting too hot. They're perfect blankets for everyday use. I would recommend them to anyone.,5,1
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!",Big enough that it keeps newborns wrapped up! I tried some Carters receiving blankets and they were way to small for swaddling purposes.Lightweight so perfect for summer! Won't make the baby too warm so I didn't worry about SIDS as much.Fabric is thin looking but it has withstood my washer.,5,1
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!","These are the cutest swaddling blankets.  The fabric stretches perfectly to get a snug swaddle.  My only wish for these is that they have a smaller size.  When trying to swaddle my newborn, it was really challenging with a lot of excess fabric.  Otherwise, I loved it and got so many compliments on it.  Plus they made great shading blankets from the sun because the blanket lets in just enough light but dulls the direct light.",4,1
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Boys N' Toys","perfect for nursing, swaddling, and just about anything my newborn needs. I always have one nearby for spit up or just to cover up baby.",5,1
"Ju-Ju-Be Be All Diaper Bag, Brown/Envy","First of all, I love the color combination! My husband can carry it without feeling awkward or silly. Next, this bag is waterproof and comes with a matching changing pad. It is very well-made, you can tell they didn't scrimp on the materials. It has a LOT of compartments and little pockets - perfect for an anal mother like me. There is even a zippered pouch where you can put soiled or wet clothes and a whole zippered compartment just for mommy or daddy's things (cellphone, keys, etc). It's very spacious, you can fit a load of things in it plus the bottle pockets on the sides are insulated. The pad on the shoulder strap makes it very comfortable to carry on the shoulder, no matter how heavy the bag is. If you are looking for a functional, long-lasting and great-looking diaper bag, then the Be All from Ju Ju Be is definitely IT. There are other designs to choose from like cute florals and prints but the two-toned ones are the most versatile. You truly get your money's worth with this diaper bag.",5,1
"Nautica Haylie Patchwork Bear, Pink/Tan","I just received the bear today but it's already soft & squishy - like it's been loved on for quite some time. It perfectly coordinates w/ the Haylie bedding, as I expected. I had planned for it to sit on a shelf as decor but it's soft enough for her to actually use and play with. Very pleased w/ the purchase!Tags on bear specifically say not to immerse in water or machine wash. Spot clean only.",5,1
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Pink","Perfect for dining out with a toddler.  Keeps most food off the ground and allows you to feed them finger foods without having to put them on the table.  It sticks to the table really well.  It is a bit of a pain to clean, because you have to wait until you get home to wash it off.  But otherwise, it is a great product to have if you go out to eat a lot.",4,1
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Pink",I was using disposable placemats that stick in place.  This placemat is certainly more economical.  It covers the perfect amount of space so that all of my baby's food stays on the placemat and not the table.  I thought the spill catcher would get in the way but it doesn't and in fact catches some of the food he drops.  Definintly worth the money.,4,1
"Nuby 3 Pack Tinted Bottle, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary",I love these bottles. They are easy to clean and manage. My son holds them perfectly. The colors are great and the price is good. No problems.,5,1
"MAM Learn to Brush Set, 6 Months, Colors May Vary","I got these for my 12 month old baby who has 8 teeth now, with 3 molars coming in. The size is perfect and she loves holding it too. It's also nice to get 2 in a pack because we keep one downstairs for mornings when we are too rushed upstairs that we forget. We keep the other one in the kids bathroom upstairs.",5,1
"NUK/Gerber Seal N Go Disposible Liner, 50-Count","The bags that my insurance supplies for free with my pump only hold 5oz which is not enough when you have to pump exclusively. Now that my baby is drinking 8oz at each feeding, these bags are perfect! I also had a problem with the old bags which leaked a couple of times, but I have never had that problem with these. Between transportation to and from home/work/daycare, these bags are great!",5,1
"NUK/Gerber Seal N Go Disposible Liner, 50-Count",I bought these for my wife - was a bit reluctant as I figure the madela bags were the best made and was concerned with leaks.  My wife felt these were better made.  The price simply pushes it over the top.  We freeze the breast milk and these have worked perfectly.,5,1
"NUK Learner Cup BPA Free Silicone Spout, Single Pack, Colors May Vary","This cup was the perfect trainer for my daughter.  We first tried the Avent 9 oz magic cup with the soft spouts but the spouts leaked constantly from the hole in the back of the spout that allows airflow.  The design of the NUK allows for the necessary air flow but doesn't allow leaking (unless turned directly upside down and even then its a very slow drip)!!  Further, the cup is a bit more narrow for her hands, which makes it easier to hold and therefore to learn to tip up, etc.  The only aspect that didn't come immediately, and this is true for all cups with a spout on one side, is that the kids frequently try to drink from it upside-down and the liquid doesn't run out.  Thus the ""training"" part :)  This cup washes very well, doesn't stain even with lots of orange veges during meals and makes it easy to ensure the baby receives proper hydration.  The other aspect I appreciated about the design was the spill proof insert that allows you to pack a full cup for travel and remove it when its time to drink.  After only a few days I ordered another!",5,1
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 3 Pack Kiddy Cutlery Spoons, Colors May Vary","My son has been eating with utencils for a long time.  However, with cereal he seems to have a tough time getting the last little bits.  I tried several different style bowl, before finally realizing how uncomfortable his hand must be wrapped in a grip around this character-ended spoon.  It occurred to me it would be more comfortable if he had a fat, round handled spoon.  These are perfect, because while they give the perfect handle, they don't forfeit volume capabilities.  The spoon is a good size in diameter & also deeper than regular spoons.  It's perfect!  Just what my toddler needed!  As always, Amazon got me my product incredibly fast.  I definitely recommend these spoons!",5,1
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free Fun Grips spill Proof Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary","great cup, had this over a year and my son still uses it at daycare on a daily basis. Few leaks and cleans perfectly.",5,1
Beatrix Potter Peter Rabbit Comfort Toy / Security Blanket,I was SO incredibly happy with this purchase.  It took a good while to get to me . . but it came from ENGLAND!  It was so unique and perfectly fit in with the birthday girls' bedroom decor.  She LOVES snuggies and her mommy was so impressed that I found something that would match her room as well.  I got lots of requests on WHERE I found something so unique and personal.  Loved it!,5,1
"Dr. Sears Smoothie Sipper, Green, 18 Months",My daughter loves smoothies and this cup is perfect for them because the wide straw allows thicker liquid to flow. I also like that one end of the straw is thick at the bottom which does not allow my daughter to pull the straw out. Easy to clean (only 3 parts) and easy for her to hold. Plus I like that it's shaped like a pear.,5,1
"Dr. Sears Smoothie Sipper, Green, 18 Months","We have a 10 month old little boy who is not terribly interested in solid foods.  Somebody suggested that we offer smoothies - so I went looking for a wider straw for him; I found that most of the smoothie cups were geared towards adults.  Huge, heavy, and with a straw that wouldn't stay put.Our baby who previously would throw all manner of food off his high chair (in his defense, he is a gagger and probably needs more time before eating big chunks of food) will suck down smoothies out of here like nobodies business - he loves it.Pros:Perfect size/volumeThe straw has a catch on it so they can't pull it all the way outSuper cuteWashes easilyShaped for little handsCons:I can see it leaking a bit where the straw comes out of the cupI've heard the straw breaks easilyI wish the straw catch were higher up on the straw so that they couldn't pull the straw all the way out and have it catch only at the end.For the price though, I'm not going to complain too much about the quality of the straw.  I hope that the company who makes these takes note, however!",4,1
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Diaper Pail, White",This product is completely serves the purpose and at 25 its very reasonably priced. I've had it for 2 months and so far its been working. The lid design could have been better as you have to 'push' the button down at the same place where you have to pull the lid to open. Kind of counter intuitive. Like other reviewers mentioned a foot pedal would have been perfect. The bags are perfect fit and there is no tying etc. Its easy to use and lasts for a week or so (with a 2 month old baby).,4,1
"Dr. Sears Nibble Tray, Yellow/Green, 12 Months","My daughter is 15 months and happily munching on finger sized foods.  She attends daycare and I found that I was packing what felt like 10 different plastic containers or ziploc bags just to keep her food separate.  This is perfect! I haven't used the chilled leafy section yet, but when I get around to making jello, I will.  She doesn't quite understand dipping her foods in sauces yet so it will be a while til we use the section for that.  I highly recommend this product!  It feels durable and we can put it in the dishwasher (a huge plus!)  I haven't tried to test whether or not the liquids from each section will spill into the other sections if tipped over - but when I have extra time (haha) I will.",5,1
"Dr. Sears Nibble Tray, Yellow/Green, 12 Months","These copartments are the perfect size for my 10 month old to have lots of small amounts of various foods but the lid doesn't stay on and leaks.  I use two rubber bands to keep it shut but it still has to lay flat at all times or it leaks in my bag.  I have two of these already from my previous son who is now 3 and I am going to order another 2 just because I love the portion sizing, but these aren't great for taking out and about.",4,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether Set of 2,"Sophie is one of the best purchases made for our son.  This was purchased when he was about 15 months and was having a lot of teething pain.  We had seen positive reviews, but thought it was just a trendy fad.  The price also seemed high for a teether, but Sophie has been worth every penny.  Our son carried Sophie around for weeks and will still chew on her every once in a while months later.  She is perfect for his little hands and mouth.  She does squeak, but isn't annoying.  A friend has one for her child and agreed that Sophie is worth owning and is more than a fad.  We got a two pack knowing we were expecting another child and are planning on breaking out the second Sophie as soon as our younger son starts teething.",5,1
"Bright Starts Comfort and Harmony Portable Swing, Florabella","I got this swing for my daughter to sit in while i'm coaching cheerleading.  She loves it, and is perfectly happy sitting in it and watching me work.  It works really well, too.  It actually swings better than my full-sized Fisher Price swing, and doesn't eat through batteries nearly as fast.  As other reviewers have said, yah the music isn't super baby-ish, but let's be honest--Avery doesn't care and I like the break from the nursery rhymes most of her toys play.Easy set-up, and great portability (folds in half...takes, like, 2 seconds to store).Update 8/12/12: This swing is still running great!  My daughter (who is now 1.5) found it in the garage when we were moving and insisted she get in and swing.  It still swung perfectly just like it did when she was a baby (she weighs 23 lbs now).",5,1
"Strolee 2010 Lightweight Stroller, Mauve","My 4 year old is old enough (and big enough) to have outgrown most strollers, but still gets tired walking through a mall or amusement park.  This stoller is absolutely perfect for her--she's 43"" tall and 46 pounds, and this stroller glides along so easily (even when I had to navigate it with one hand and a Whole Foods shopping basket in the other!).  Folds easily and is so lightweight; we can take this anywhere.  I only wish I had found this sooner--could have prevented many tiring outings!",5,1
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado",this wet bag has worked out fabulously for us! it fits perfectly in our arm and hammer diaper disposal. its sustained numerous washings and doesnt give off that bad dirty diaper smell. for anyone looking for a wet bag for their disposal units this is the one to go with!,5,1
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado",Perfect fit for the Safety1st Economy Diaper Pail (found at Babies'R'Us for $20). I have two of each (pail and liner) so we can keep one upstairs and one downstairs; we throw the liners right into the machine with the diaper loads and hang dry with CD liners. Looks good after 3 months and washed once/twice a week.,5,1
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado",This bag is perfect! It is nice & heavy duty & I haven't any issues with it leaking. I use it in conjunction with my Ubbi pail - which I love - and never smell the dirty diapers at all!,5,1
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado",JUST TOOK IT OUT THE DRYER!!!PERFECT WITH THE SIMPLE HUMAN TRASH CAN.I USE IT EVERYDAY AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,5,1
Taby Tray Home School Car Vehicle Kids Children Activity Play Fun Desk,"I have a toddler in a Graco convertible carseat and this works just fine with it.  The tray, however, works even better with booster seats.  My two older children have boosters and the tray fits perfectly under the armrests of their boosters and sits right on top of their thighs.  When they want to color and want it higher, I just position the tray on top of their arm rests.  They love that the surface is hard and their crayons, snacks, whatever is on the tray does not roll off.",5,1
"Evenflo Discovery 5 Infant Car Seat, Confetti Aruba",It was perfect.  It was a good order.  I like that no one else in the area had one like it.  And it was everything I wanted it to be.,5,1
Evenflo Splash Mega Exersaucer,"I have bought at least 5 Evenflo Exer-saucers over the past few years.  I have found the best price on Amazon...sometimes 1/3 - 1/2 the price at retail stores.  I can't say enough about this product and it's positive effects on babies 4 months old and up.  They can sit upright in a very safe seat with excellent support and see the world from a whole new vantage point at a very early age. One small drawback is that the item is shipped in the original box, no concealment or protective packaging.  That said, I have never received a damaged item even though the boxes have not aways been in perfect condition.",5,1
"Lamaze Early Development Toy, Sir Prance A Lot","Once more, a terrific product from Lazame.  Their baby toys are so colorful and fun for little ones.  They fit to well over the handles of car seats, strollers, carriers.  This one has lots of chewies on the tail and the 'knight' is in a perfect place for a young baby to grab easily.  The feet make crinkly noises which my grandbaby loves and the tags on the saddle entertain him for ages.",5,1
"Lamaze Early Development Toy, Captain Calamari",He chews on the feet and rings. He adores the rattle. He doesnt care for the mirror on the bottom. He's not afraid of it. It just isnt as cool as the rattle or the crinkle hat. He takes it everywhere and it fits perfectly on his carseat handle.,5,1
"Lamaze Early Development Toy, Captain Calamari","This is a wonderful toy for an infant! It was my older daughter's favorite and I'm sure my 5 month old will love it just as much. The legs are perfect for teething babies to chomp on and there is plenty to keep a baby busy. The hat makes crinkly noises, the rings clack together, the ball rattles, there are plenty of legs to chew on, and theres even a little mirror hidden on his underside. I know it says surface wash but we have tossed it in the wash in a lingerie bag on gentle cycle and even dried it on low for a little while and it came out good as new.",5,1
"Balboa Baby Shopping Cart Cover, Diamond","I searched and searched for a wonderful cover that could be used for both restaurant high chairs as well as shopping carts. The Balboa shopping cart cover is absolutely perfect! I LOVE IT!:) The suri design is much more beautiful in person. I've already received many comments on the design/coloring. I was a bit hesitant as a few of the reviews had mentioned that it was difficult to fit over shopping carts. I have only tried it on a Safeway regular seated shopping cart and it works well with that size. It does take a bit of shifting the baby around at first and at first, it seems like it might be too snug but once you have the hang of it, no problem. I love that the belt is attached to the cover and that it is a wide fabric belt. Others that I looked at had a thin strap and it seemed as though it would cut into the baby's tummy. Overall, this is compact, stylish and comfy for baby. I recommend it!!",5,1
"Kokopax City Carrier, Gumdrops","I was worried about purchasing a backpack carrier for my 13 month old son.  He weighs 24lbs and I am 5'2"" and 115lbs.  This carrier is perfect if you are shorter.  It also fits my husband well at 6'0"".  It is lightweight and distributes the weight on your shoulders well.  The straps are a little wide, but overall is it comfortable.  My son has loved it so far!  We are looking forward to walks on vacation, sightseeing, and around the neighborhood walking the dog.FYI - If you are buying for a boy, I was surprised when I ordered ""bubbles"" and part of the pattern is lavender.  Hard to see until you're up close in person.  From farther away it looks more gray, so we are keeping it.",5,1
"Dutailier Ultramotion Cherry Sleigh Multiposition and Recliner Glider Rocker, Cocoa","Love this chair. It was simple to put together and is perfect for our needs. We recently adopted a toddler who has a lot of night-terrors and this chair is the perfect spot to hold her and rock her back to sleep. The only thing that keeps it from being a five star is that the arm cushions keep coming off, they are just a bit too tight for the velcro to stick to its self. We also got the matching ottoman, which unfortunately you have to order separately but which makes it even more comfortable.",4,1
"Sunshine Kids Shade Maker Canopy For Strollers, Black","We have the bugaboo chameleon, which we love, except the sun shade isn't long enough to shade our child's face most of the time, and if we pull the shade all the way down, she can't see. We tried getting her to wear a sun hat, but we all know how long kids keep hats on. We also tried hanging a light blanket over the edge and the wind just blew it off. I was so sick of flipping the sun shade back and forth on what were supposed to be leisurely strolls, that I went searching for an alternate. I put this sun shade on the minute it arrived and it worked like a charm! Easy to attach, adjustable, and SUPER light. The only negative is you can't fold it back when taking the child in and out, but it's easily bendable, so it's easy to just nudge it back with your shoulder. Plus, since it twist and folds in a snap, and it's so easy to take on and off, it's not really a huge negative in my mind. I can actually do long strolls without constantly having to check if the sun is blazing down on my child's face. Another plus is that it also fits on our light travel stroller, which is perfect for trips this summer. It has great side pockets for a light wallet, chap stick, keys or sunglasses. So great, because I don't have to go fishing around the stroller bag for small items anymore! It would also fit a cell phone, but because of reports about radiation and cell phones, I wouldn't suggest it. I keep my cell under the stroller in a bag and away from her brain. I find myself constantly asking why bugaboo doesn't just make their sun shade exactly like this one?!",5,1
"Sunshine Kids Seat Belt Pillow, Grey",super soft and fits the belt perfectly.I got a gray one also. my son and daughters love them. it also keeps them from putting the belt behind there back.,5,1
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"It is tall!  I am 5'7&#34; and it is great, no kicking the wheels no bending.  My 6 month old loves it.  Love that it reclines.  I know there is complaint about the sunshade, its fine, nothing is perfect.  I put a hat on my little man anyway.  I bought this as a second stroller post not wanting to be in the baby seat and not always using the bulky double stroller when the 4yo wasn't with me.  It's light as far as strollers go and folds in a snap.  Love the 5 point harness for my little guy now and the squirmer later, goes to 50 lbs, bonus! Can't beat the quality for the price.  I would buy it again.",5,1
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"We've had this stroller for almost 16 months now and love it. It is our only stroller.Pros:&#8226; Built solid. We've had no problems with the construction. No tares, loose screws...nothing. Wheels are in great shape, like almost new. For me, this makes the stroller worth every penny.&#8226; Folds into a nice compact shape for the closet or the car. Easy to lock/unlock with hand or foot. Will fit sideways in the hatchback of our little Scion XD.&#8226; Adjustable recline.&#8226; Front wheel locks for steering. I like them locked for easy one-hand control. My wife prefers them unlocked.&#8226; Rear wheel locks to keep stroller from moving. Easy to engage/release.&#8226; Reasonable storage room including cup holder. Diaper bag can be hung on handlebars* (*see Cons).&#8226; Has fit our girl perfectly from 6 lbs to 20 lbs so far and no sign of getting too small yet.Cons:&#8226; Sunshade is very small. We got an extension (RayShade...works great once you figure out how to configure it).&#8226; Can pinch the jeesums out of your finger when you fold it up if you aren't careful. After doing this a couple of times, I fold it up very carefully.&#8226; You can hang diaper/grocery bag off handlebars, but be very careful...can tip stroller if baby isn't in it. Best to remove items before removing baby.&#8226; Not a jogger, obviously.",5,1
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"We currently own two main strollers, this one and the Chicco Cortina. The Chicco is a fantastic full-size stroller; however, it is large, heavy and a bit cumbersome. For this reason, we wanted a smaller, more compact stroller. We started with the Jeep umbrella stroller and it was too short, too narrow and simply didn't function as a decent stroller. So began the search for the perfect stroller.The Ignite might possibly be the perfect umbrella stroller!Pros:It is lightweight and folds up very compact- just like an umbrella stroller should. Barely takes up room in my trunk.The parent compartment is awesome. Two cup holders would've been nice, but it does have one nice cup holder and a zippered compartment for your keys, phone, etc.It is much wider than most umbrella strollers. When my son was 18 months, he was already outgrowing our Jeep. He is two now and has oodles of room to grow.Child foot rest- our son seem very comfortable.5 point harness. Our son cannot get out of this thing!Easy recline. Our son doesn't sleep in strollers, but it is nice to be able to recline it sometimes. If your kid falls asleep in the stroller, you could easily recline it while they are sleeping.Tall handles. My husband is 6'4"" and is comfortable pushing this stroller.High Back. My son is rather tall for his age, and his head isn't even close to the top.Goes to 50 lbs- most umbrella strollers top out at 35Handles great! We are very active and out almost every day. This stroller does great on all types of surfaces and is easy to maneuver.It has a basket. Although it isn't super easy to access, it is still there! Not something you find on most umbrella strollers. It fits a diaper pod and a sweat shirt or two just fine. I hang my diaper bag from the handle bars.Insanely easy to assemble.True one-hand fold or open. As a busy mom, this stroller lives up to that feature. The lock switch that locks the stroller up and you pull up to close, it super easy!- Most umbrella strollers are a struggle and often result in a broken nail.Cons:The basket is rather difficult to access. Though, it is an umbrella stroller. While I would not accept this from a full size stroller, I will for this one. To have a basket on such a small stroller, is great and it does come in handy.Only one parent cup holderNo snack tray or cup holder for our kid. I purchased an after market one and will see how it goes.The sun shade is a joke. We are out most of the day, and I don't even bother with it! I have ordered an aftermarket one, and will see if that helps. For now, the sunshade is great for stashing small items- his sippy cup, snacks, etc.If my diaper bag is on the handles, and I take out my son, the stroller will sometimes tip over. This was resolved by putting two small weights above the front wheels.Overall- This is a fantastic purchase! It is my go-to stroller for the majority of our daily outings. I only take my full size out for long day trips now. My son loves this stroller and will often ask to just sit in it! If you are looking for a compact umbrella stroller with full size stroller features- this is the one!",5,1
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"This stroller is exactly what I expected it to be. I made sure to research strollers before just buying one of those cheap ones at the drug store. I wanted it to recline because I have seen too many people pushing their umbrella strollers on the two back wheels in order to recline their kid. I also wanted a visor, a basket, and a cup holder. This stroller has all of these. I pushes great! You can easily maneuver this stroller with one hand. It also has a decent basket to store your purse or diaper bag. The cup holder has an extra pocket that is perfect for napkins, keys, or your phone. This stroller is also tall enough that you don't kick the back or have to stoop to push it! There are three things that kept this from getting 5 stars. One is that it would be nice if it could recline just a little bit more. I have to prop a blanket for a pillow when my son is sleeping. The second reason is that it would be nice if the visor was completely mobile. And the third reason is that it is a little hard to get into the basket when the seat is reclined. But overall, I love this stroller!",4,1
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"Fantastic stroller! We bought this for our nearly 4 year old before our trip to Disney World. It was a life saver! Pushed easily with her weight. Cup holder and zipper compartment were awesome features. and the storage net underneath was perfect for purses/jackets. We used it on a few other trips and now that our daughter no longer needs a stroller, we have passed this along to a friend who adores it as much as we did!",5,1
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"We bought this stroller for an international flight, and it worked perfectly.  It rolls smoothly and effortlessly, is great for tall people (I'm 6'2"" and don't feel bent over pushing this stroller), closes with the kick of the foot (to pop up the locking mechanism), folds down tight like an umbrella stroller, and it's quite light.  The reviews on here are spot on... this thing is excellent, but it would be nice to be able to adjust the tilt on the awning... once it's open, it's fixed in position.  A minor complaint in comparison to how great everything else on it is.",5,1
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"Perfect stroller. Lightweight, easy to assemble, durable and comfortable for 17 month (28 lb) granddaughter.  The product detail was on target",5,1
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"Bought this stroller for our 2 year old so we could stop carting our giant Graco around.  It's lightweight, the perfect height, easily adjustable seat & straps & our daughter enjoys riding in it.  Worth every penny!",5,1
The First Years Ignite Stroller,Love this stroller! Perfect size for traveling and shopping with my grand baby!,5,1
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"My daughter is 3 1/2 years old - when I bought this stroller and she is about 3'2&#34; tall.  I was looking for a umbrella stroller that was for a bigger kid.  This stroller was perfect, it moves easy, the handles are tall enough so I am not hunched over when I push her, it folds open and closes very easy.  I love the pouch at the top for keys, phone, money..etc and the cup holder.  The bottom basket is just okay - its hard to put things in the basket because the frame from the stroller is in the way.  But you can put a jacket or something that can fold easy into the basket.  My daughter fits in the stroller with room to spare, she likes being in this stroller - she calls it her big girl stroller.  I did a lot of research on strollers before I bought this one and some people may think its pricey for a umbrella stroller, but to me it was worth it, because this is a upgraded umbrella stroller.  I love it an would recommend it to anyone looking for a stroller for a older child.  I did not give the stroller a 5 star only because of the basket.",4,1
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","I just bought this for my 11 month old son, I needed something lighter & not as bulky as my full size stroller 4 short trips & this is perfect! Not only is it a reasonable price it's also cute & all I had 2 do was put the wheels & canopy on which took less than 5 minutes...also it shipped in about a week, this is worth buying & seems like a very good product!",5,1
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","We use this thing ALL the time. Held up perfect, still looks brand new. It folds up very nice, and when my son is in it, he seems comfortable, and still can see everything.",5,1
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","We bought this when our first stroller became burdensome because of its bulky size.  This stroller is perfect for shopping,  and I was pleasantly surprised by the ""mom bag""  between the handles.  It fits lots of needed things like keys and drinks.",5,1
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","Love this stroller!  So worth the $40 to not have to lug around my sons original stroller with the detachable car seat.  This is light weight but sturdy at the same time.  Perfect for the mall, a walk, etc.  Only thing it that the green color is not nearly as vibrant in person.  It's still nice looking though!",5,1
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black",I was looking for a light stroller to take with us on our vacation. Traveling with a 2yr old is a handful all on its own so I was looking for a stroller that was light and easy to open and close. To my surprise this stroller was nice and sturdy as well.This was perfect!,5,1
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","This stroller was for my grandson and its perfect!  He loves it, and so do his parents!  Its well made, easy to fold and unfold, lightweight, and easy to push.  I love Amazon and always look here when I'm trying to find something.",5,1
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","I needed an inexpensive umbrella stroller for a weekend trip to the Big City.  This is the perfect umbrella stroller except for the canopy.  It really shouldn't even be called a canopy as it covers and shades abolutely nothing.  But aside from that it's easy to open and close, my child was comfortable and it steers smoothly.  The front console is wonderful!  It holds drinks, sippy cups, keys, cell phones, boarding passes, everything!  And the little underneath basket is handy!",5,1
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","very lite and i'm 5'4&#34; the handles reach perfectly no hunching over to push. this stroller doesn't recline as much, but i still love it. The pouch it comes with is very convenient too. the 5-ponit harness is easy to use, the button is not as hard to press.",5,1
"The First Years Wave Stroller, Crimson Red","***UPDATE*** My son and I took this on a a test drive today and it's AMAZING. Smooth ride, cozy bed area for the baby, perfect sized canopy, great adjustable handle, and so easy to handle it's ridiculous! Can't wait to do more strollin'!Granted, I just got this stroller today but I already LOVE it! It was extremely simple to put together with very easy instructions to follow. It looks GREAT upon completion and super easy to change it for all the different features. The canopy is HUGE and will easily cover baby from all angles of sun. The swivel feature to change the seat from forward to rear facing is super, super simple and fun! The stroller is a bit wide but we will mostly be using it for walks outside so I don't really care how wide it is - people can get out of our way!The red/black combo looks awesome and I'm sure we will get a lot of ""where did you get that stroller?!"" because it looks so cool and unique.I bought a hanging basket drink/holder thing and it doesn't work super well but I fiddled around with it and it works good enough for me. I also don't care that the basket underneath isn't huge because I hang my diaper bag from the handlebar and it will still fit in the basket anyway if I wanted to put it there.Also easy to fold up and fits our car seat with the adapter. Love it!",5,1
"The First Years Wave Stroller, Crimson Red","It's been 2 weeks since i got the stroller and am loving it! Every time we go out we always receive a comment how nice and expensive looking  it is especially when they see that we can rotate the bassinet, they can't help but ask what brand it is and where we bought it. I did my research for 2 months before i ordered the wave and am glad i did! It's great it comes with car seat carrier!(which is up to $30 when you buy it separately.) My baby is just 2months old and am using the chico key fit30 car seat and am surprised that it worked perfectly in the wave stroller! No need to use the rope lock coz it clicks(sounds that it's locked). Am so happy with it and,it's so easy to maneuver with one hand and easy to collapse and build, and it's not heavy! My choosy husband loved it too, to the point that he always want to be the one pushing the stroller,and he's proud using it! I saw a lot of comments how it smells like chemical when freshly out of the box, and honestly mine don't have that smell. For the other comments about the handle of the stroller touching the ground when you collapse it, just make sure you adjust the handle to the shortest mode so it will not touch the ground when you collapse it.The cons, it doesn't have parent cup holder,and kinda tight basket but that's fine with me coz what important is the need of my baby, for under $300 having a luxury stroller that can rotate, have bassinet that can turn to stroller, large canopy, and elegant looking it's all worth it. Anyway there's no perfect stroller, what matter is what's your priority features on buying one.If your thinking to buy this stroller, buy it, you'l not gonna regret. Thanks Amazon for the lowest price out of other store!and fast delivery too! I saw this one in BabiesRus for $380, so over price.",5,1
"Boppy Newborn Lounger, Geo",This was on a gift wish list and was exactly what the new mother wanted.  Perfect gift for a baby shower and apparently quite useful.,4,1
"Boppy Newborn Lounger, Geo","I was given one of these (in pink) by a family member. My daughter was born a month early since they had to induce me since she wasn't growing properly. She was only 3lbs 5oz. She was in the NICU for two weeks so when I brought her home everything was to big! There was no way I was putting a little baby in a BIG crib and the rock and play I got for her swallowed her up. So I used this with rolled up towels holding her in place and it worked perfect. She would lay on this and (even though it says they shouldn't sleep on it, since it is a pillow) she slept on it, on top of my bed because it was the only thing she some what fit into and was happy with. As she grew we continued to use it just for awake time and it has been such a HUGE help! I am a bit sad she has almost grown out of it now. I highly recommend it even if you can only use it for a few months it was a HUGE help to us.",5,1
"Boppy Newborn Lounger, Geo",This item is adorable and so perfect for a mommy to be! I got this for an expecting mother and she LOVES it. It's great for any newborn up to 4 months. Thank you!,5,1
Baby Einstein Christmas Gift Set-16 Pieces,WE GOT IT FOR MY SON WHEN HE WAS A BABY AND HE LOVED IT VERY MUCH NOW THAT HE IS OLDER WE GAVE IT TO MY FRIENDS KID AND HE LOVES IT TOO THE TOY ARE BRIGHT AND SOFT PERFECT FOR BABIES HANDS. JOEL,5,1
The First Years Smartwarmer,"This is a very good bottle warmer - the best out there.PROS- Easy to use - You select one setting from each group, which is what makes it ""smart"". It's easy enough that my Luddite grandmother can use it.- Fast warmer - this of course depends on how cold and what type of bottle you put into it, but on average, it takes a couple minutes.- Relatively accurate warmer - If you select the appropriate settings, it will warm perfectly. Sure, you can scorch the milk, but you can do that in a microwave or other warmer too!- Easy maintenance - fill the bottle of water and go to town! No need to constantly fill it like other options.- Best warmer on the market, and I've tried a bunch.CONS- Yes, that beep is LOUD. But if you're in the other room, you'll hear it. You can also turn the beep off.- I have noticed that for the first bottle in the morning, it tends to not warm up the bottle perfectly, requiring you to heat it again. But after that, it works perfectly every time. It's just a quirk. All the PROS make it worth it.- The instructions should clarify that if you want to turn it off in the middle of a cycle, you need to push and HOLD the power button - handy if you need the bottle fast!",4,1
The First Years Disney Pixar Cars  Rev and Go Potty System,"My little guy loves the sound that makes when you he is done.Although he still in diapers he loves to sit, and try while we are in the bathroom.He also uses it as a step, is perfect because he can reach to the sink and wash his little hands.",5,1
The First Years 4 in 1 Potty Training System,"This is the perfect little potty for our two year old daughter.  It is small enough for her to maneuver onto it and it will also move to the adult toilet when she is larger, as our toilet is very tall.  She will be able to use the step-stool to climb onto the adult toilet as well.  I'm not sure we will use the little inner compartment to store anything; seems somewhat gross to put things into a potty.  I think I would call this a three in one potty!  It is a great value and doesn't come with all those singing electronic gadgets.  If you want a simple potty, buy this one, it is well-made!",5,1
"The First Years True Choice P300 Premium Digital Monitor, One Parent Unit",I actually bought two of these... one with one parent monitor and one with two.  I used the single one for My daughter and the dual one for my son.  Our house is big so it gives me a way to hear my daughter (age 7) when she calls to me with out her having to scream!  It also allows me to talk to her and ask her politely to come down with out having to yell.  I use the one for my son in the nursery and have the 2nd parent monitor up in the Master Bedroom so that I can call up to my husband from downs stairs too!  The two kid monitors sit side by side downstairs and I can always hear my kids.  At night my daughter doesn't really need monitored so it works well and we haven't had any interference with them  As far as clarity I read all the reviews and I was worried because a lot of people complained about the quality but I have used a lot of monitors over the years and I think this is one of the better ones! No monitor is perfect but this one is Great!,5,1
"The First Years Miswivel Feeding Chair, Owl","I love this chair. It has so many features that make it stand out from others. I love the recline and swivel feature. I received this seat when my daughter was 8 months old, so I did not have a need for the recline but I could easily see this being used from birth, instead of a cumbersome highchair (I have never like them!). Both my 2 year old and now 11 month old fit perfectly in this seat. The ease of removing/adjusting the harness is great, I dont really like a 5 point harness in a high chair/feeding chair, the shoulder straps always get so dirty, so its nice to easily take them off to wash, or remove them all together. One wish I do have, is that height could adjust a bit taller, my short 11 month old can reach the table without the tray though its a bit higher than i would like.",5,1
"Baby Jogger Summit XC Single Stroller, Red/Black","So far, I am really happy with this purchase. Very well made and versatile. It even comes with the front wheel adjustment knob in case you need to &#34;fine tune&#34; the drift. No stroller is perfect but if you looking for something to jog with and at the same time versatile enough to go to the store with, I'd recommend this product. Of course the wheel base is a little bit wider but I am sure you did not expect to get a jogger that is as small as a mini right? Oh, please also note that the basket under the seat is a little tricky to get to without undoing a couple of clasps but you will appreciate that fact when you realize that it also helps keep everything securely stowed. Hope this helps.",5,1
"Safety 1st True View Color Video Baby Monitor, White",Up until our daughter moved into a toddler bed we used a basic audio monitor. When it was time for the big move we were determined to find a video monitor to help give us a peace of mind with her new freedom! We have been using this monitor for about 2 months and love it! The picture is outstanding and the audio is perfect with no crackles or pops (had that a lot with the basic audio monitor previously used)Bad things include short battery life after charging and the blue light on the handheld part is a little bright during the night.Other than those things this monitor was a great buy for the price and quality.,4,1
"Trend Lab Dr Seuss Messenger Style Diaper Bag, Cat in The Hat",I love this item.. baught for the dr Seuss baby shower for my daughter.. it was a hit.. it was in perfect shape and great condition a million thanks,5,1
"Luvable Friends 12 Washcloths With Bonus Toy, Blue","Luvable Friends 12 Washcloths With Bonus Toy, PinkAdorable little baby washcloths, these are soft and thin for baby's use.  I use them as individual hand towels in my bathroom for guests and they are perfect for that as well.  The colors wash well and stay lively.",4,1
Pem America Colorful Sea Pillow,This accent pillow was the perfect addition to our fish themed room.  I have even washed and dried it and it came through intact.  Very pleased with this purchase,5,1
"BooginHead SippiGrip, Boy Camo",Does exactly what it says. Perfect for attaching to strollers on walks or at the mall. Keeps it from dropping on dirty ground.,5,1
"BooginHead SippiGrip, Blue/Green/White","I love this handy strap!  When little person throws the sippi, I don't have to go searching for it.  It is always hooked to the high chair.  Stays in one plays and the tether is long enough to still use and get a drink.  Also, since it is hooked to the high chair, it make the sippi the perfect height for when my little person is running around...they can get their own sippi when thirsty!  This thing ROCKS!!!  Totally want another for traveling.",5,1
Opair Child Leash Harness with Fanny Pack Dinosaur,"I love the Hands-free ability and the Parent's fanny pack connection to my son - very convenient. The connection cord could be a little thicker. I would also like to have a way (other than just grabbing the cord)to manually stop or lock the leash extension & retraction (like what you can do via a push-button/switch with a dog's leash) The child's fanny pack is very cute & He Likes it.  I would like to see an additional harness-feature (Like a backpack-style Strap option), as all the stress as he pulls is around his waist.  Then it would be perfect.",4,1
"Compac QuikTop Can Cap, Red/White/Blue","I can't live without these caps.  I'm a 1/3 can a serving person and I hate, hate, hate to throw out the rest or leave it in the refrigerator uncapped.  These caps are perfect.  Granted, they are a little difficult to pry off when you empty the can, but if you leave the can to come to room temperature, the top will pop off.  I love them!!!",5,1
Fresh N Freeze 2 oz. Reusable Baby Food Containers 12-Pack,"I love this freezer storage system. I am going to purchase two more. They are the perfect size. I prepare all my baby's food at once for the week and then I just pop it into these containers and store in the freezer. The tops screw on and off which is perfect. I don't like pop on types because they tend to pop off. I love the microwaveable aspect because when my baby's ready to eat, if I don't have some out defrosted already I just take off the top and nuke em. Big Plus.",5,1
Fresh N Freeze 2 oz. Reusable Baby Food Containers 12-Pack,"I bought a set of these when I first started making my own baby food and I loved them so much, I bought a second set. They are easy to clean and store and are the perfect size for a baby's portions. They also are great when kept in the freezer, does not appear to have any freezer damage and also keeps the food in good condition (as long as they aren't in there for months and months...). I also like how you can stack them as the tops snap into place on the bottoms, so it keeps organizing simple. The only thing is, if you fill them too full and then freeze them, the tops sometimes pop off. However, that is just user error and easy to remedy. I would recommend these to everyone who makes their own babyfood!",5,1
Cardinal Gate Stairway Special Kid Gate Brown,"Exactly what we wanted. Installation was simple. Had to mount at angle on deck, but worked out perfectly with wider extension. Easy operation. Looks nice, blends right in. Nice and light. Great quality. Bought for toddler, but should have had years ago for dogs.",5,1
Days of the Week Closet Organizer WHITE,"I purchased this for my daughter (age 5) who was just starting Kindergarten and I wanted something to help her get organized and to be able to quickly get ready in the mornings for the bus.  This works perfectly!  I've had it now since Aug. and it hangs securely with no problems, even when all slots are completely full with tennis shoes, jeans, etc.  My daughter really likes it because it helps her see and understand how many days are left in the week before the weekend.  I would highly recommend, especially for younger children to get organized!",5,1
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Flannel fitted Crib Sheet, Ecru","This sheet is perfect for our Sealy crib mattress! Finally a perfect fitting sheet! It is soft, pink, and toasty warm. I am extremely satisfied and would recommend to anyone having a hard time finding a sheet that actually fits their child's mattress! It is exactly as described and arrived promptly.",5,1
"DaVinci Kalani Mini Crib, Cherry","I wanted this crib due to not having a lot of space. I needed something sturdy, yet smaller than usual because the baby is sharing a room with us. Although the baby isn't here just yet, we set the crib up early and I love it so far. My husband had no problems assembling it, and it fits the space we have perfectly. I actually thought it would be smaller, but I think it's a great size, roughly the size of an open Pack-n-Play, but taller so you can move the mattress down as baby grows. Speaking of the mattress, we went ahead and ordered the 50 coil mini crib mattress that's suggested for this model and it fits wonderfully. The pad it came with wouldn't suit any baby for sleeping. So far, I'm completely pleased with this purchase.",5,1
"DaVinci Kalani Mini Crib, Cherry","This came with clear directions, was fairly easy to put together, and seems very sturdy, although I wouldn't let my 3 year old jump in it.  I'm 8 months pregnant (and not &#34;steven&#34; but the other parent in the household) and I put it together in an afternoon with some light assistance from my three year old.  It fits perfectly into our small apartment - right next to our bed - and is really quite big.  If this baby grows anything like my older one, I'm expecting to get up to two years out of it.  As it is, my 3 year old tested it out and found it quite cozy - but she is on the smaller side and likes to ball up.  At any rate, this was a better buy for us than a bassinet or pack n play.  A bassinet or cosleeper would fit in our space but has no longevity, and a pack n play is just not comfortable, in my opinion, for a sleeping baby or for me to bend over.  (I'm 5'7&#34; and my boyfriend is 5'11&#34;.)  I also think it would be possible to leave the front panel off if for some reason you wanted to do that.  I had it assembled with the back, sides, and bottom panel and it was sturdy like that too.  This is a great way to have a real crib in a small space for very little cost.  Oh, and it's adorable.We got the Dream on Me 3&#34; mattress to put in this and it fits snugly.  I recommend the Circo pack n play sheets from Target to go on the mattress - they're a perfect fit and only $10 for a set of two.",5,1
"Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet, Grey",I received this order very promptly and it fit the pack in play perfectly. I would recommend this item to others.,5,1
Lambs &amp; Ivy Jake Hamper,This hamper perfectly matches the bedding set we found in one of the baby stores in our area.  It will be perfect in his room!,5,1
"Carter's Butterfly Flowers Rug, Pink/Choc, 30 X 40&quot;","I ordered the 13pc Geeny crib bedding set, which is pink & brown flowers & butterflies, & wanted a rug to match. Came across this rug & was hoping it matched the set, & it did! It's a very cute rug, the colors are pretty & it's the perfect size to lay beside the crib. I am very pleased.",5,1
20 Pack NEW/STERILE Medela Breastmilk Feeding and Storage 80ml / 2.7oz containers 100% Sterile NEW with sterile wrapper seal on bottles,"Exactly what I needed.  Great price for indivially sealed, sterilized breastmilk storage containers.  Perfect for freezing breastmilk and works with my Medela pump.",5,1
Lascal BuggyBoard Maxi+ - Black,"Because of the folding mechanism on the G series Uppa Baby stroller, it's very difficult to attach most ride-on boards to the vertical portion of the frame. After extensive research, I tried the Valco Hitch Hiker, but the attachement straps were too large to fit anywhere without interfering with the stroller mechanisms.  The Lascal Maxi Buggy Board is perfect for my stroller, because the attachement straps are narrow enough to place below the folding mechanism and lower cross bars, and above the brakes, though it does make it slightly more difficult to access the brakes.  I don't think the MINI Buggy Board would work either, because the attachment straps look larger.  Not perfect, would be better if Uppa created a board for the G series, but works for me so far.",5,1
Graco Alano Flip It Travel System,"This travel system is really great, is not too bulky like another Graco Travel systems.The fabric is soft, beautiful and unisex in my opinion.This stroller seems to be really safe, great quality and price!! :)* Now my baby is 3 month old so, I want to actualize my review. The only con that I see in this stroller is the fact that, when you change the position of the handle bar the stroller cant be directed as well as in the original position, but is a minimal issue. This product is fantastic!! Also, the first month of my daughter, she only want to sleep in the newborn chair, and it was fantastic because she have a cleft palate and the chair was in the perfect angle for her to not aspirate her milk!",5,1
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","Super soft, great colors, perfect for my new baby.They do look a little worn after you wash them though.",4,1
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","I almost didn't buy these given the comments people made about snagging and washing issues.  I'm pleased I went ahead as these muslins are the best thing for swaddling I have found, having tried many different options.  The size is perfect, they don't unravel easily so baby can't escape from the swaddle and being bamboo, they feel wonderful.  I agree they are susceptible to snagging if caught on the likes of velcro, but that is the nature of the material and snagging issues can be minimised with a bit of care. As for washing, which was my primary concern from the reviews, they are washed regularly in a laundry bag and they remain looking like new.  They have also been accidently washed out of the laundry bag and emerged without incident.  Given how regularly these muslins are used in our house, I think the price is reasonable.  All in all, this is a quality product that I am happy to recommend and would gift to my friends.",5,1
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","I wanted to swaddle my newborn but worried about the Arizona summers and her overheating. This blanket is perfect- it's thin and breathable. As an anxious mom I worried about suffocation, but I tried breathing through this blanket, and you really can breath through the fabric. And if I need to wrap her up a little warmer I double over the blanket. It washes great, and is always soft. Stains come right out. We use it as a blanket, have used it to clean spit ups, used it as cover-up over her car seat to keep her out of the sun, and used it as a nursing blanket. And after dozens of washes it's still super soft. I'm glad I got a 3-pack because we use it for everything. I just wish I had a larger version of this blanket for myself!",5,1
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","The bamboo swaddling blankets are even softer than the regular Aden and Anais swaddling blankets (which I still love). They get softer with each wash. Because they are super stretchy, it makes swaddling baby that much easier, and they are the perfect weight of fabric for baby to stay comfortable all night. We used these every night until our son was about 3 months old and began to break his arms out of the swaddling. These are now my go-to gift for new parents!",5,1
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly",I received one Aden and Anais swaddling blankets as part of a baby shower gift and absolutely feel in love with it. I ordered 2 four packs immediately after. The prints are gorgeous and the fabric is so soft and amazing. They wash well and actually get softer with each wash. Perfect for the warmer season as it has breathability. I will only wrap my baby up in these...nothing else!,5,1
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","These bamboo blankets are TONS softer than the muslin ones by aden + anais. I love the style and the softness. They are lightweight and perfect for summer time. My only complaint is that I washed them for the first time with other items, and the ink bled onto several other items in my load of laundry. I haven't washed them yet for a second time, but I am hoping it was just a one time deal.",4,1
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","Aden and Anais really make the perfect swaddle blanket, they are so soft and breathable. They are expensive but well worth the price tag. My only complaint is that I thought from the picture the middle blanket was grey and it appears to actually be more on the blue side.",5,1
"aden + anais Cozy Muslin Sleeping Bag, Alpha Bit, Small","Got this for our 10 month old (9 months at the time), that is around 29&#34; long. Fits her perfectly with room to grow. It's super soft and comfy for her, thick to keep her warm but not to make her sweat. We love it!",5,1
"Dream On Me Full Size 2 in 1 Folding Stationary Side Crib, Natural","Good quality, sturdy, easy to store, perfect for our 7 month old grandson when he visits.  We were so happy with our purchase that we ordered another one for our 2nd home",5,1
"Dream On Me Full Size 2 in 1 Folding Stationary Side Crib, Natural","My parents bought this crib and keep it at their place for when we visit. It is perfect. It's easy to set up, folds down small. When the baby was little, we could raise the mattress up. And now that she's standing, we keep it low. Love that it takes a full size crib mattress like at home so it makes the transition to sleeping at grandma's a bit easier. Very happy with it.",5,1
"Dream On Me Full Size 2 in 1 Folding Stationary Side Crib, Natural",The folding crib is perfect for the grandparents' house! It is truly a full size crib and it folds flat very easily. I am very happy with this purchase.,5,1
"Dream On Me Full Size 2 in 1 Folding Stationary Side Crib, Natural",I wanted a basic crib and this fits the bill perfectly.  I had no need for a convertible crib as we already own twin and queen sized beds that baby can eventually grow into.  This crib will work perfectly for the approximately two years it will be needed.  I like that this crib has wheels making it easy to move it from the nursery to our room to the living room.  I also like that the mattress can be raised/lowered as appropriate for baby's age. The crib also folds up for storage making it perfect for grandma's house or for storing it away for future children.The crib is very easy to assemble.,5,1
"Contours Lite Stroller, Tangerine","Perfect, affordable stroller for walks around town! Excellent storage. Sunshade adequate. Closes easily for car travel. Holds drinks for baby and mom. High ratings from Consumer Reports. Arrived from Amazon in two days!",5,1
"Contours Lite Stroller, Tangerine",This stroller is super.  Sturdy - easy to fold - comfortable to push.  I used it for my grandbaby and it works just perfectly.  Goes in and out of car easy as pie.,5,1
"Nurtria BPA Free Milk Powder Container, White","the size its perfect to carrion the diaperbag. the matrial its strong,i like the color white, and its easy to clean.",5,1
"Summer Infant Deluxe Top of Stairs Wood Walk-Thru Gate, Cherry","Easy to put up and stays in place well. The material is soft and a beautiful color that matches cherry wood and darker perfectly. A little harder to open than others but it's on the baby's room so I'm okay with that. It doesn't slam quit like the others either, more of a soft close like kitchen drawers.",5,1
Summer Infant Dresser Table Pad,We tried so many dresser pads for the DaVinci Emily diaper changer and none of them fits it as good as this one. Do not buy the DaVinci pad. It is so flimsy and comes apart in a couple of months. This pad on the other hand is very sturdy and fits perfectly!,5,1
Summer Infant Dresser Table Pad,"The pad is thick and provides good cushioning for my son while on his changing table.  The pad seems durable and like the plastic won't rip.  The product details have the dimensions listed as 36 x 16 x 2, but on the packaging the pad is listed as 34. Since the pad is good quality and since it fits my table's depth and length perfectly and is only 1/2 inch short on the width, I am keeping the pad.",5,1
"aden + anais Cozy Muslin Swaddle Blanket, Jungle Jam - Giraffe","I use this for baby in both the summer and winter. It's breathable and is a great size for swaddling and a stroller cover. I have a ton of baby blankets given to me but I really only need this. My baby sweats a lot because of her car seat (Chicco Keyfit 30) so I don't want to put a blanket on her that would make her sweat more. But this blanket is perfect as it's warm and breathable. It does fade a bit and doesn't look pristine after washes but I don't care as much as I can see that the material is quality and does get softer after washes. Good blanket, worth the money.",5,1
Dream On Me 3&quot; Portable Crib Mattress,Fit Pac n Play perfectly.  Covered with Dream sheet and now have a happy grandson sleeping on it.  Would recommend this mattress to cover existing Pac n Play pad,5,1
Dream On Me 3&quot; Portable Crib Mattress,"After some research, the crib I was ordering came with a lame 1 inch ""mattress,"" which is basically a vinyl pad. This mattress fits my DaVinci Alpha Mini Rocking Crib perfectly. We are having our first child so I have no idea what I'm really doing as far as cribs and stuff are concerned but the mattress is not super soft and I am using the pad that came with the crib for extra firmness if needed. Dream on Me mattress has a vinyl top so any leakage can be cleaned up pretty nicely. The American Baby Company Waterproof Fitted Quilted Porta-Crib Mattress Pad works with this mattress also. This also ships APO which is great for military families who are limited to baby items at their base/post.",5,1
Dream On Me 3&quot; Portable Crib Mattress,"I originally bought this to replace the aweful mattress that was included in my Chicco Lullaby LX pack & play as the mattress included was so thin.This mattress is wonderful! And, it is made in the USA!The funny part is we did use this in the pack & play, but we used it even more in the playroom.  This is nice to just have out in a playroom for them to lay down on/relax/read/etc.  It has been used even more in this way.  Just thought I'd point this out since I hadn't thought about it before it accidentally happened.  One day we took it out while putting the pack & play away & they layed on it & loved it. We decided why not have a soft mattress in the playroom.  It has been there ever since.I do want to include that it didn't fit our pack & play perfectly.  There was a little gap, but what we used it for this wasn't an issue.  However, if you plan on them sleeping in here this might be a safety issue especially depending on the age.Pack & plays should come w/ this level of mattress. I wish someone would have told me sooner to buy this - it is worth every penny.",5,1
Vera Bradley Baby Bag in Canyon,This bag is just perfect for my daughter and her new baby girl.  After two boys she is finally able to have something in another color than blue or camo!,5,1
"5 Piece Dark Gray Suit with Shirt, Vest, and Tie - Size 10",The pants fit perfectly but the suit jacket was too big. Had to get it tailored. The white undershirt was thin but was a decent material.,4,1
"5 Piece Dark Gray Suit with Shirt, Vest, and Tie - Size 10","I searched everywhere for a suit for my son.  I did not want to spend a lot because I knew he would only wear it for a few hours total.  The other reviews convinced me to order the suit.  The vest, jacket and pants are a good quality.  As I read from the others, the dress shirt is thin and short but did not matter to me.  The zipper tie is cute and so simple to adjust on a squirming child.  As for size, I ordered one size larger than my son currently wears in everyday clothes and it fits perfectly.",5,1
Flip Individual: 1 One-Size Snap Closure Diaper Cover &amp; 1 One-Size Stay-Dry Insert - Blossom,"This is probably my favorite diaper cover system. I have used them both with the included insert, and with just a regular pre fold, so you can save yourself the money.Honestly, I like it a little better with the pre fold, but the included insert is great too!In my experience, the adjustable waistband and rise has fit perfectly with no leaks from about 15 lbs on.. When they were smaller, we had better luck with prefolds rather than the included insert, and we had some leaks.Overall though, a very cost efficient system, especially when paired with prefolds, and I really recommend them. :)",5,1
"Kidkusion Retractable Driveway Guard, Black, 25'","We bought this to section off one side of our yard for our dogs, it works perfectly. I'd does sag in the middle but that's no big deal. This is exactly what we were looking for!",5,1
"Safety 1st onBoard 35 Infant Car Seat, Regal",We chose this infant seat based on reading customer reviews and reading consumer reports as far as safety.  It is a great value because of the larger weight limit of 35 pounds.  We have had it since our daughter was a newborn and she is now 5 months and 16 pounds and it still is not getting too small for her.  The newborn insert gave her a more comfortable fit.  It fits perfect in our jogging stroller and is easy to get in and out of the car and into the stroller.  We have not had any issues with the straps not fitting or the insert not being comfortable.  I don't have anything negative to say about this car seat.  Safety was our number one concern and this was one of the top rated at the time we bought it by consumer reports and was more affordable than the other ones that were rated equally safe.,5,1
"Baby Jogger Stroller Carry Bag City Mini/Micro, Double",I have the City Mini Double and the stroller fits in the bag perfectly.  I'm not sure if the other reviewers have a different model or aren't putting the stroller in properly but I've never had a problem getting the stroller in the bag.  I travel quite often with the kids by myself and while it takes a few minutes to get the stroller in the bag at the gate I was expecting that with a stroller this size.  Our bag has ripped in a few places which is why I didn't give this 5 stars.  I haven't been able to find a stroller bag that is strong enough to last through multiple trips without tearing.  The airlines are horrible with gate checks and damage.  I wouldn't travel with this stroller without the stroller travel bag.,4,1
"Baby Jogger 2010 City Select Single Stroller, Onyx","We have a 2yr old and a 2 month old. I wanted a double stroller that I could switch the seats to be forward or rear-facing. The city select seemed perfect! It's not, BUT I still really like it! And don't regret spending $600+ on it. I use the 2 seats, did not get bassinet or car seat adapter.Pros:I'm 5'9"" and love how far the handle extends.Love the brake on the handleI like how easily and far back the seats recline. My 2mo old is very comfortable and safely restrained in his seat (even tho they officially say that it is recommended for infants 6mo+)Like the diamond color and it seems to clean easily. I've had to wipe up some strawberry juice and it came right off.Like the generous sun shades. Tho I must admit I have unzipped the mesh on the back (they say not to) to give it more room (to completely cover my baby when he's reclined)Great basket with zippers to expand.Customer service is great - had a rip in basket. Called them and they shipped another the next day.LOVE that I can have my kiddos facing me or turn them around. I switch them up all the time. Of course, I don't use all 20 configurations, but I switch between 3 quite often.Cons:I didn't want a tandem stroller and this one is a bit tandem-like with both seats on. But of course it would be when you're trying to fit 2 kids on 1 stroller!Difficult to push up and down dips in the sidewalk with my 30lb girl in the front. Makes my outside wrist sore. I did find a configuration that I liked with her closer to me and the baby in front.Tough to push up over curbs.  It's sturdy and I can actually pop it up just by pushing down on the handle with all my weight, but it's hard.It's heavy to get in and out of my trunk. Oh well, it's what I expected.",4,1
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Straw Bottle, Blue/Yellow, 11 Ounce","As many parents will tell you, you may need to go ahead and kiss a whole bunch of frogs/ buy a dozen bottles or sippy cups before you find your prince/ the perfect cup for your child. I was no exception. After a whole bunch of cups that leaked (a great many), spilled easily, was too hard to drink from, too easy to drink from, whose lid popped off too easily, and so on and so forth, I may have found the perfect cup with this one. Maybe I can spare someone else from a whole bunch of toads by just trying this one first.Here is why I loved it:- Easy to drink from -&#62; the NUK and Playtex brands and some others that I purchased required the child to bite and suck at the same time, which made drinking harder. My guess was that this was to prevent leaks, but my child didn't like it and she drank less. With the NUK, liquid also pooled at the top area of the straw, so when you closed the lid, pushing the straw down, it would spurt that liquid on your new blouse.- Easy to open and close lid that is leak proof --&#62; Many other cups used the same mechanism... a strip of plastic was to be pulled down that would bend the straw downwards. This often wasn't effective and any liquid still in the straw would get on you. They also weren't always leakproof and if you opened it up again, the straw would spring back up with vigor, and again, splatter liquid that would invariably get into your eye. This cup has a full lid that is neat and doesn't squish the straw the same way, so no problems there. The button is also easy for a child to operate.- Easy to store and hold form factor -&#62; There is also a stainless steel version but I prefer the clear version as it allows me to easily check how much is left and when I need to refill. I do like that it has no handles and so is easy to pop into the side of my Daddygear backpack. Some cups come in a rather squat shape with large handles that makes it hard to do that. Those cups were supposedly designed to be easier for a child to hold. This cup is still very easy for my child to hold, even without the round flat shape and handles.Thanks to this quite affordable option, I can finally stop purchasing different cups on the quest for the perfect one. My cup graveyard, which consists of at least a dozen different cups, can finally be put to final rest. They sit on my kitchen window sill, looking like multicolored tombstones. What an eyesore I can be rid of at last.",5,1
"Baby Jogger 2010 City Select Stroller Second Seat Kit, Diamond","The City Select is an awesome stroller. It is easy to maneuver, easy to put together, fits nicely in the car and is very stylish.

"Munchkin Mighty Grip Utensil Set, Colors May Vary","This utensil set is perfect for my little ones hands.  The fork is not too sharp that he'll stab himself, but pokey enough that he can learn to spear his food.  The spoon bowl is a little large for his little mouth, but overall this set is excellent.  The grippies make it easier for him to hang onto the utensils.  AND, bonus, we got blue/green ones despite the ""colors may vary"" aspect :)",4,1

Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,I love this sippy cup! The first time I tried it with my child she did great. Super easy for her to use. Not the easiest to clean and it does leak on occasion. But they are perfect for on the go. I will for sure buy another one.,4,1
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"I have been looking and looking for the perfect straw cup for my 11 month old. I have been using thePlaytex Baby First Lil' Gripper Twist 'n Click Straw Trainer Cup, 7 Ounce, Colors May Varysince about 7 months old as a learner cup, and it worked amazing. The only downfall was that the straw was short and would always leave 1oz of liquid left in the cup. And it spills very easily. Then i tried theMunchkin 2 Pack Mighty Grip Straw Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Varybut it took way to much suction to get the liquid out(even for me). Then i finally bought this cup even though the price is much higher then other cups, the reviews made it HAVE to try it. Just received it today. My son loves is already, he is very picky when trying something new, it is easy to drink from, does not spill and the weighted straw is an AMAZING feature and makes sure every drop of liquid can be drank even when the bottle is tilted. I will DEFINITELY stock up on these cups.",5,1
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,My 11-month old would only chew on the other types of sippy cups.  Her pediatrician said to try and teach her to use a straw because it's better for developing her motor skills.  At first she wouldn't use then one day she just began using the straw and holding the cup!  I love the weighted straw too because she doesn't have to tilt the cup to drink.  It's perfect!,5,1
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"We have gone through 12 different types of sippy cups, 3 straw types and this is the only one she will use.  There's no negative suction to suck food back through the straw.  She didn't have to bite the straw to make drink come out.  It just worked perfectly from the start.  I love the straw (great cleaner comes with the spare straw set).  We are so happy to finally find a cup that works.",5,1
Zoli Baby Matties Silicone Travel Mats - Orange - 2 ct,"Despite her initial attempts to throw it around, this placemat has been a godsend for our 14 month old when we eat out.

"Stork Craft Hoop Glider and Ottoman, White/Beige","I wasn't willing to spend a lot of money on a glider.  This glider is perfect for me.  It was packaged well. The directions were easy and it only took my husband about 15-20 mins to put together.  I purchased the beige cushions with the white frame.  The color was exactly what I expected it to be. The glider will go well in my nursery.  I should also mention that it glides smoothly.  Some reviewers have complained about the smallish size, but with my feet on the ottoman it isn't noticable (I'm 5'6). The back cushion is quite comfortable. I am happy with my purchase.",4,1

Freemie Hands-Free Concealable Breast Pump Collection System,"I absolutely love this product.  I work as a Customer Service rep from my home.  It was so difficult pumping with one hand holding the horn to my breast while typing with the other hand.  Although I use a headset for the telephone, I could only pump one breast at a time due to the need to be able to type with the other hand.  Not sure if it was the nerves or the uncomfortable position I was holding the horn while typing, but I was only able to pump from 2 to 4 oz at a time.  This is 2 to 4 oz for both breasts!  I was really worried I would have to supplement with formula.Looking online for something to increase my milk supply I found a few reviews on Freemie.  I then started purposely looking for reviews on Freemie.  I have to admit I scoffed at a couple of reviews that stated how much their milk supply had increased.  Thought they were definitely exaggerating. You will probably think the same of me, but I can tell you truthfully that my milk supply has gone from 2 to 4 oz to 9 to 10 oz per pumping cycle with both breasts (that's about 4.5 to 5 oz per breast).  My husband had to buy me new milk containers since I am now making enough to freeze my milk.  Before the milk was being put in fridge as baby was drinking faster than I could produce.I am now able to pump a lot more frequently since I can just put them comfortably in my bra and the people I am on the phone with are none the wiser of what I am doing (not that they new with the horns either...lol).  I am more relaxed and not so worried about my typing faster so that I can take care of more calls and not get into issues with my Supervisors.  Another thing I believe has helped with my milk supply is the fact that they are so comfortable.  I'm not sure why (maybe the way I held them to my breast or maybe I needed a bigger size), but the horns were very uncomfortable to me and really made me sore.  I dreaded having to pump.  I noticed from day one with the Freemie that they are a lot more comfortable.  My breast fits it perfectly and no more pain while pumping.That's another thing I wanted to touch upon.  I almost did not purchase the Freemie when reading the one negative review on here.  I have very large breast and was concerned about the fit.  I believe the issue is with nipple size and not breast size since mine fit me perfectly.  My breast form perfectly with the Freemie with no problems.  On the contrary, like I stated before, they are way more comfortable than the horns which do go by breast size and I sometimes wonder if that is why mine hurt so much.The one thing I won't say I do not like, but some might feel differently as it is a bit misguiding to some, is that they do not look natural.  They make my already large breast look huge and with a flat tip since the bottom of Freemie is flat.  Doesn't bother me much since I am working from home and only my children and husband see me pumping.  I have read that wearing a bigger shirt/sweatshirt over your clothes can disguise them some for use in a regular office or car.  I haven't tried it yet though.Well I hope my review has helped someone make a decision in buying the Freemie.  I am a VERY happy customer and highly recommend it.",5,1
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar",My daughter will only use the Avent soothie pacifiers and I hate them because they bounce around when they fall and we are constantly losing them. This product is perfect to stop them from falling and are great in the car seat!,5,1
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar","Mary Meyer Ella Bella Elephant WubbanubI LOVE WUBBANUB'S! What more could I say? This is my second Wubbanub purchase.I ordered one for DBG before she was born with hopes that she would take to it and she did!We have used our first one which was a small pink monkey now for nearly three months and it has been through a lot and still holding up.I wanted to have another as a back up.I ordered the ELLA BELLA Wubbanub because it was just too cute.We finally got it and I am very pleased with it.It is super soft and super cute.It is a good size not too small and not too big...just right and it's not heavy at all,just enough weight to it to help it stay where you want it to.I washed it and tried to give it to DBG and she would have nothing to do with it :( to my suprise.I decided to let her sleep with it for a few days along with her monkey Wubbanub and it worked! I realized that the reason she did not take to the new one at first was because it did not smell familar to her.Now she loves it as much as her monkey and I can wash the other one finally...as she will not do without one :) It is PERFECT in every way,it's a pacifier and her lovey/security,she will only take the pacifier when she's sleepy but she will grasp the legs and hold on tight and cuddle with it.BEST OF ALL: I don't have to dig for a paci EVER!It is so easy to find any time any where.She has a hard time holding one in her mouth(preemie) and this helps her to keep it there and when she does not want it she can just move her head and it falls out/away but stays with her.These are very durable.One of my baby shower gifts from now on.Suggestion on washing:I take a mesh bag(zipped) or pillowcase(tied at the end) and drop the Wubbanub in and throw it in the washing machine on gentle cycle,let it air dry then wash the pacifier with warm/hot soapy water or use a pacifier wipe and we are good to go.I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS ITEM OR ANY WUBBANUB :)",5,1
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar","I ordered the Jasmine Giraffe first and since my daughter loved it so much I ordered the Ella Bella Elephant as well. I think these are such cute little comfort objects for a baby! My daughter is six months old and was starting to have a harder time going to sleep so we thought a comfort object might help bedtime go a little more smoothly. She absolutely loves her wubbanubs! She plays with them, cuddles with them, uses the attached pacifier (which surprised me because she rejected a couple other pacifiers we had tried) and holds one while she sleeps. She also figured out how to use it really quickly and will pick it up and put the pacifier in her mouth on her own. I also love the size, perfect for little baby hands to grasp, not too heavy for the pacifier, and doesn't add bulk to the diaper bag for on the go. This has been one of our most worthwhile baby buys!",5,1
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar","After trying at least 11 different pacifiers from multiple brands this was one of the 2 she liked.My baby is 6 months old and just took to the Soothie about a month ago, and now its indispensable.The lamb made it very easy for her to manipulate and handle and play, she also finds extra comfort and security in huggin it, making the Soothie, even more Soothing...I agree with all the doctors and hospitals after having tried them all.Its true that the 3 -18 months size looks a bit small, but she seems to love it, and although it doesnt mimic the shape of her tommee tippee bottle its very similar in size, which makes sense overall.the only other pacifier she seems to like is the  Natursutten which I also highly recommend, very similar in shape, but a bit larger and rounder at the tip.You can separate the paci from the lamb and wash it and its perfect again, just make sure to dry well. Also, you can change pacifiers from 0-3 to 3+ if you buy them separately, its rather easy to saw. If you just like the pacifier, I guess you could buy the Soothies separate but I highly recommend it with the little pet.I also found that the Bella Tunno pacifier grips works well in the tiny round holes of the pacifier, and you can use it with the lamb is not very disruptive to the baby.Overall very happy with the product, and my baby girl seems to love it as well.",5,1
"Bright Starts Ingenuity Automatic Bouncer, Bella Vista","Looking over these reviews I'm guessing the model I have (2013) must have been updated. There is no problem with it being too upright (if anything it's more laid back than most bouncers I've seen) and the bounce mechanism has only one setting (Normal) which seems to produce a good, solid, steady bounce. When I was installing the ""bounce box"" onto the front I didn't have it on quite right and as a result the bounce would start and stop as the mechanism tried to right itself. I popped it off and got it on there correctly and it's worked like a charm since, so just make sure you have it on right. It's very soft and cushy with two removable head and body supports, so it looks like it will work for quite some time from very early newborn to older baby. I also love the range of the toy bar. It is super easy and quiet to move and makes a good frame for a blanket to drape over the top if it's being used outside to shield baby from the sun. Best part? I got this bouncer at Walmart for only $39!!!! :-) The bouncer shuts off after 30 minutes which I like because I always forget to shut off bouncers and then it drains the battery, and the music plays two rounds of the 12 songs, so it lasts about the same amount of time. Also, bouncers and swings alike NEED weight in order to work properly. If you're trying to use the bouncer or a swing without any weight in it chances are it won't operate like it's supposed to. They use the weight to gain momentum in the movement operation. I tested this with a 10 lb tub of Tide detergent sitting in it and it worked perfectly. Also, easy enough to put together. I'm 8 months pregnant and put it together myself in no more than 10 minutes using just my hands and a philips screwdriver to put in two screws. Simple enough for what it is. If you know how to read directions it's not that hard.OH! One other complaint I've seen is that active, older babies throw off the bounce mechanism, but that seems silly to me. All it means is that active babies' movements overtake the automatic bounce operation, so they are in essence bouncing themselves...which is no worse than a normal bouncer and still better since you still have the option for automatic bounce. I wouldn't pay what Amazon is asking for it, but since I got mine at a fraction of the price it is definitely worth it for me to have an automatic bouncer at the same price as the regular bouncers (and without the clumsy, toe-stubbing legs that I hate from Fisher-Price!).",5,1
Ingenuity Portable Swing - Bella Vista,This was very easy to assemble and it is the perfect size. I like the music choices and the various speeds are perfect...not to rigorous like some swings. I also like that it's easily portable. Can't wait to use it with baby #2!,5,1
Ingenuity Portable Swing - Bella Vista,"I bought this swing over a year ago while still pregnant.  I LOVE IT!  It is super portable, and easy to set up/take down.  It reclines nicely and cradles my baby perfectly.  One of the best things about this is how long the batteries last.  As I said, I have had this for over a year now, and still have yet to change the batteries and that is after heavy use while she was small.  Also the music that it plays is much easier to tolerate than other toys/swings that I've seen.  It's not super obnoxious, and actually works to soothe the baby!And I agree with other customers that this swing is actually better than the full-sized version!",5,1
"Safety 1st Wide Doorways Fabric Gate, Natural",This gate works perfectly. I used it for my brand new puppy. The only problem was that she was so small when I first got her ( 1 pound) that she was able to squeeze through the bottom opening. Now at 2 and a half pounds she can't squeeze through it anymore. It's very easy to use and is also attractive to look at. The gate also does not leave any marks on the walls. Super fast shipping. Thanks!!,5,1
"Boon Grass Countertop Drying Rack, Green",Its perfect! I use it everytime when I was my baby bottles and the good thing is u can put whatever you want on top of it and it fits perfectly .,5,1
"Boon Grass Countertop Drying Rack, Green","I was having a hard time finding a product to dry my cartridge cases after running them through the ultrasonic cleaner. This item fits the bill perfectly. Amazon delivered quickly (as usual) and the price was great. I know it is not it's intended purpose, but was a great find.",5,1
"Boon Grass Countertop Drying Rack, Green","We use the Playtex Drop-Ins system. Thus, we wash the bottle frames once every week or so in the dishwasher, rings once a week (or more often if they have dried on milk visible) in the dishwasher or manually as needed, and nipples after every use as a batch manually. We have 12 nipples. They all fit on there at once and we have a row leftover (thus we could fit 16 nipples lined up side by side). We do not push the nipples into the grass like the picture shows because they dry just fine lined up floating on top of the grass and we don't want to do anything that could damage them or cause the bottles to leak by not getting an airtight seal. We keep the drying rack upstairs on the vanity of our 2nd bathroom closest to the feeding station. While I could see how other reviewers would say it is small, it is the perfect size for our uses. I also like that the grass can easily slide out of the frame for cleaning up the water spots in the bottom of the white tray. We have used it daily for a month.We originally thought that we would have an issue with our cat walking/chewing on it because she likes houseplants and it looks like a houseplant sort of and she also likes walking on countertops. However, once we had it in hand, it was obvious that our cat wouldn't dare touch this twice. It is too rigid for her to enjoy eating and it would hurt if she were to put her fragile paws on it. We haven't ever seen her get near it and there is no damage from her trying, either. While it is rigid, it does give way to push things like bottle rings into it. It is perfect!",5,1
"Frenchie Burp Cloth, 2 Pack, Blue","I ordered a few sets of these burp cloths recently because I ordered one set before and I really like them a lot!

"Fisher-Price Space Saver Swing and Seat, Discover'N Grow","With our first child we bought a $160+ swing.  It was huge, and it was fancy.  However, our daughter didn't like it, so we ended up returning it.  We eventually found an older Fisher Price swing, similar to this, one, but had to return it after borrowing it.  With our most recent child, we were able to borrow this from my sister-in-law (with that, I can not comment on price, it was free for us to borrow).  So far, it has been a wonderful swing.  Our son loves it, especially the vibration feature.  He also enjoys the swing on occasion, but seems to prefer the calming vibrations.  As a parent, my favorite feature of this swing/seat is the locking mechanism that turn the swing into a seat.  It is sturdy and ensures the seat doesn't move if bumped by the older child in the house.Unfortunately, one of the major flaws with this swing is that it is only battery operated and does not have an AC adapter to power it from a wall jack.  And it goes through batteries FAST.  The vibration feature has worn out the battery that powers it in less than a week of light to moderate use.  The swing side has been used quite a bit less, but the performance has nonetheless declined quite rapidly, even with light use.  Fortunately, Fisher Price made it so the swing motor was powered by a different set of batteries than the vibration function, so we only have to replace the batteries on the side you use most.  Fortunately for us, the vibration function  I also understand that the lack of an AC adapter might be due to the portable nature of the swing/seat.  I still think that is a weak excuse though, it would be a perfect product if it had an AC adapter option.Despite this oversight, I still highly recommend this product.",5,1
Summer Infant Playard Pad,"These pads are more comfortable and soft than the pad that comes with the play yards. I have two graco pack n plays and it fits perfectly in them.

"Summer Infant SwaddlePod, Ivory, Newborn","Our twins were born approx. 5 lbs each and couldn't use the Swaddlepod until they were a month old.  The zipper bunched up uncomfortably, and they could get their arms out of the neck hole.  Instead, we used the SwaddleMe, which worked well, but wasn't perfect. When they started wiggling out of the SwaddleMe (7 lbs?), we switched to the Swaddlepod, and we've been using it ever since. They're nearly 4 mos old, between 12 and 14 lbs, and just about too big to use the 'pod.  Because the fabric is stretchy, we've been able to use it longer than we thought (without making them uncomfortable).  Unfortunately, there is no larger size, so we'll have to wean them from swaddling (we're not interested in buying larger sizes of other items).  The fabric is very light, so we easily used it with sleepers during the cold spring and now use it with onesies in the hot summer.  The zipper at the bottom made nighttime changes easy.  They wash up easily, too, and dry quickly if there's a blowout.  Now that they're older, they can get one arm out when they want to, but we can still poke it back in if it becomes a problem.  No real problems, except now that they've used it for a while, the neck is permanently stretched wide.  It would have been nice to have a neckline that was elastic and remained sealed/stretchy.  Otherwise, this was a real life saver so we could sleep at night!!",4,1

He is 5 years old, 45lbs not sure about height but about average.  He wore it fine and even fell asleep on the way home.  I was pleased with the way the vest positioned the seat belt.

He also found it comfortable enough to wear on the drive which was an hour each way.",5,1
"C.R. Gibson Thank You Notes, 10 Boxed, Alligator",These are great! We've reordered three times. Perfect for baby gift thank yous as well as for my two year old son. Love them!,5,1
"Carter's Bound Keepsake Memory Book of Baby's First 5 Years, Laguna",This is my third Carter's memory book. I have one each of my boys and it is my favorite book out there. Perfect amount of blank pages to write in misc things and everything is laid out in order and the book misses nothing. All the big milestones and birthdays are included. Just perfect!,5,1
"Carter's Bound Keepsake Memory Book of Baby's First 5 Years, Laguna","I had been looking for a gender neutral baby book for quite a while.  I ran across this book early in my search, but thought that it seemed a bit boyish as the colors in the pictures looked so bold.  After coming back to this time and time again, I chose to order it.  If I didn't like it, I could always return it.  It was EXACTLY what I wanted! The colors are more pastel than bold, and the animals and decor on the inside is perfect for either gender.  It would be nice to have more places for ultrasound pictures, but there are extra pages in the back to use as you see fit.  All-in-all, a GREAT purchase!",5,1
"Carter's Keepsake Chest, Meadowlark","I love this chest.  Its the perfect size and really cute and convenient storage for a child's first year keepsakes. I was terrible at keeping a baby book, but there were sentimental items I wanted to save.  I didn't have a really cute place to store them until I found this chest on amazon.  It has 3 levels, the top level lifts at the top and is where you can store a sizeable baby book (if you did one) as well as hospital birth certificate, photos, or other document or large flat items.  The second level is a thin drawer with 3 slots.  This drawer has been great for storing my ultrasound photos, hospital bracelets, nursery card, and the other little tiny items I saved from the first year.  The third level is a bigger, deeper drawer, that can hold the hospital blanket, take home outfit, first pair of walker shoes as well as room to spare. It is just a really cute way of storing and organizing the baby's keepsakes if you are someone who is not creative in creating their own storage (like me). I've recommended this to all my mommy friends, and I will also gift this as a wishing well, or additional gift, at any future baby shower.  I love this item.",5,1
Tiny Love Super Mat,"A big hit with the whole family. Baby f 7 months,kids 4 & 6 all enjoy playing on it. Bright, colorful, and big. Great to move toys around the house.  Carry baby's stuff from basement play area to upstairs easy with this mat. Will be great for summer picnics and beach blanket too. Perfect gift for someone expecting. Buy it.",5,1
"BenBat Travel Friends On The Go Head and Neck Support, Chic, 0-12 Months",Fits around her neck perfectly. Love the magnet that helps it to stay put. She still falls forward. Just how hard she sleeps. I added a seat pet to this and it seems to work so far. Nothing can keep her body from falling forward a little but at least she has cushion,5,1
Beaba Spoon and Fork Multi-pack,My little girl is just starting figure out how to eat with a spoon and fork. These are the perfect size for her little hands. The spoon is not too shallow or too deep - so the food doesn't go everywhere. The fork has rounded edges and is very nice too. The plastic is sturdy and looks like it will last through all the banging and falls on our hardwood floor.I would recommend this set to any toddler learning how to eat.,5,1
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","The print is exactly as shown, It is a great bag, wish it was a bit bigger but it does the job perfectly. I hung it  to dry in the sun and even after a 4 hours in 70 degree weather is still wasn't dry in the corners, and I had pulled the inner layer out, no big deal.",5,1
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","It's waterproof, and odor-proof. I like the colors, not just for kids.Small wet bag, perfect size for:- a couple of swim suits in summer time- two cloth diapers- one spare jumpsuit in the diaper bag",5,1
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small",this bag is perfect for keeping soiled cloth diapers contained in my diaper bag. it locks the smell in and doesn't leak. it is also machine-washable and hang-dries pretty quickly in the sun. the small bag can fit about 3-4 inserts (i use g-diapers). i'm planning to get a larger size to use for wet swimsuits and beach gear also. i would highly recommend this bag for anyone using cloth diapers!,5,1
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","I don't cloth diaper, but this is perfect for all of baby's dirty clothes while we are traveling. It keeps them together, and keeps smells out of suitcase until I can wash them.",5,1
"Jeep Overland Limited Jogging Stroller with Front Fixed Wheel, Fierce","I got this stroller in 2007 for my first child. LOVE this stroller sooooo much!  Still use this stroller just about everyday with my second child.  I have NO complaints whatsoever.-The shade is awesome!  Even if it doesn't come down far enough, I just unzip it and adjust to cover my child's eyes.-I've used this stroller in all weather and all terrains.  Does great in perfect weather, rain, snow, wind.-The tires are terrific on pavement and hiking trails.-Not too heavy, not too bulky.-Folds up easy even though you use both hands to do so. It's really not a problem at all.I have decided to write this review because I can not find a more perfect stroller.  I am having another baby in september, which will put the kids at 4.5 (he doesn't use a stroller anymore), 18 months and then a newborn.  I've been looking for a double stroller that would meet my expectations, but am very frustrated at my options.-I WISH JEEP MADE THIS STROLLER IN A DOUBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Just wanted everyone to know how awesome this stroller has been for the past 5 years and counting....",5,1
Kidorable - Lucky Cat Umbrella,"I bought this for my 6 year old, cat obsessed daughter. It's adorable, and perfect for a little one. It's durable and has lasted through some heavy duty use.",5,1
"Paul Frank All Over Printed Julius Blanket, White","My son has a ton of Paul Frank stuff, so of course, we had to have this blanket.  It's a fantastic blanket that is very warm and snuggly, especially on the colder nights.  It's a very cute, colorful design that Paul Frank is known for and one that I don't think is too kiddie or one that screams baby blanket.  I feel like this is a blanket my son can use through the toddler years and possibly beyond. I've had this blanket since before my son was born, and now that he's here, it holds up great.  The material feels like high quality material and is constructed well.  This blanket doesn't feel like it will rip out any time soon and goes with us pretty much everywhere, along with a Boston Red Sox silky my son also uses.  I live in Michigan, so this blanket is perfect for our cold winters.  Overall, very cute, colorful and another hit for Paul Frank!",5,1
"Dream On Me Mission Collection Style Toddler Bed, Cherry","We have been very pleased with this bed. It came well packaged, wasn't too difficult to put together and has been holding up well. We have noticed that the side rails come loose often because our son likes to hang on them, or climb over them ect. Usually it just requires a tightening of the hex bolt, but sometimes we are afraid he is actually going to snap the whol rail off! We would just remove the rail if so. The bed is very low to the ground so its perfect in case he doesn't manage to fall out!",5,1
"Zo&euml; b Organic On The Go Sleepy Hats, Sweet Cream, 3-9 Months","I searched for weeks for something like a baby eye mask as my daughter was unable to fall asleep during the daytime without something covering her eyes. It's like she couldn't shut out the stimuli. I ordered this hat and have been very very happy. She doesn't always allow me to put it on her, but when she does she sleeps really well and peacefully during the day!Perfect!",4,1
"Pinzon Baby By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Wild Thing","My son loves his aden and anais pinzon blankets.  I had received a single aden and anais blanket from a friend and used it to swaddle my son at night. I don't swaddle him anymore, but I wanted another one for the stroller or car seat. They are great to use for a nursing cover as well.  My son is 5 mo. old and he loves to scrunch up the blanket and put it to his cheek.  It is so sweet!  I think it is worth the price tag- you get four blankets!  I paid less then $10 a piece for them which I don't think is so crazy.  They are perfect for a newborn who likes to be swaddled.",5,1
"Munchkin Snappy Bottle Tote, Colors May Vary","Like this product. Right size and perfect for my needs.VERY disappointed that there was no color or pattern choice. It was for my baby grandaughter and I wanted a pink pastel pattern. After several  return try's, I just gave up and accepted baby blue as my only choice.",4,1
"Munchkin Designer Diaper Change Kit, Colors May Vary","I have the Skip Hop Pronto Changing station and like it more, but this costs half the price and is a handy little thing.Here a brief comparison: The Skip Hop has a larger pad (same quality though on both and both have a bit of padding for your child's head), snap buckle for closing the station and on the carrying loop (feels more secure) - the munchkin has a velcro closing and snap-button carrying loop, roomier pouches for wipes and diapers (not a huge difference but with a toddler and size 6 diapers it does start to make a difference).I will be using the munchkin for my new arrival due in a few months - newborn diapers will fit perfectly; and the Skip Hop for my toddler - it just lasts longer since it is a little larger and seems to hold up better to being 'overstuffed'.",4,1
"Dream On Me Classic 2 in 1 Convertible Stationary Side Crib, Cherry","I don't believe the saying ""you get what you pay for"" applies to this purchase!  I was very pleased with the quality of this crib.  It seems to have very solid construction and is a very pretty design.  I purchased it as a crib for Grandma's house, and it's the perfect price!  Honestly, I also think it would be very substantial as a primary crib.  I would definitely recommend this crib to others!",5,1
"Dream On Me 3 in 1 Portable Folding Stationary Side Crib, Cherry","I'm very happy with the crib.  We visit my sister often and used a Pack and Play when my son was smaller. Once he outgrew the bassinett portion, we hated the Pack and Play.  It was so hard to lay him down without hurting your back or having him wake up as you lowered him down.  This crib is great since we don't have to bend all the way down to the floor to lay him down. Even at the lowest height, the crib is at least a foot off the ground.  My husband loves the changing table feature which I have not seen on any other portable crib.  We have taken the crib on a few road trips. Its not as easy to travel with as a pack and play but my son sleeps well in it and its easier on our backs.  I read the negative review about not being able to find a mattress or sheets that fit.  I ordered a mattress and sheets from Amazon and they fit perfectly.  I knew that portable crib mattresses are very flimsy so I didn't expect to use it anyway.",5,1
"Dream On Me 2 in 1 Portable Folding Stationary Side Crib, Cherry","We purchased one in 2009 for our firstborn and it was perfect. When we moved back to the mainland though, we ended up giving the crib and the mattress away.Come 2012 and we were expecting our second little bundle of joy. We decided that the baby would sleep in our room for the first couple months before we moved him into a room of his own, so we once again turned to the portable mini crib. I found the listing on my old baby registry and ordered another. Same great quality! Works so well in the space near our bed and the baby sleeps nicely in it. I still love the fact that it looks like a regular crib, only smaller by a couple inches. :) It's sturdy and we can wheel it from room to room if we chose to. And I love that it folds up so it'll fit in our mini van and we can take it with us when we go for visits with family...don't get me wrong, I don't drag it with us for visits to family that live nearby...just for the ones that live a couple hours away. :)Delivery through Amazon was quick and easy. There was a small dent on one of the slates on one side when we got all the pieces out of the box, but we put that side against the wall. It took the hubby 30 minutes or so to get it all put together.As other reviewers have mentioned it does come with a mattress, but it's only an inch thick pad that looks like my yoga mat.  We purchased a separate 3"" mattress and the crib looks much more comfy.",5,1
Dr. Brown's Bottle Warmer,"After a month and a half of using hot tap water from the sink (hellooo inefficient!!) to heat my newborn twins' bottles, I finally caved and bought this bottle warmer, and OH MY GOD, I'm so glad I did!I had not planned on ever purchasing a bottle warmer (""people survived without one for generations, I'll be fine!"") but after gettin tired of reheating the same mug of water nearly three times just to heat ONE bottle at 3am (did I mention I have twins?!), I began to rethink my philosophy just as my brother handed me an Amazon.com gift card for my birthday.I thought a bottle warmer was a luxury, but after I ordered this one and gave it a shot, I cannot imagine living without it. I'm even considering buying a second one to keep at my in-laws' house!It's super easy to use and the little cheat sheet of heating times is perfect! Like others have said, if you don't unscrew the cap a little you will get some leakage, but that is easy enough to avoid. The water reservoir is also really smart--I've used the first year's warmer at a prior daycare job and having to pour water in there every time was not only annoying but a gamble if you didn't put in exactly the right amount.Don't think twice about getting this warmer, totally worth it!!",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Soft Spout Deco Training Cup, 9 Ounce, Colors may vary",Like another reviewer said...if you assemble this cup properly it works perfectly! If the little part in the middle of the soft spout is not pushed completely through the hole in the center of the hard spout you will only get air. However if it is put together correctly it is the best cup. I recommend this cup to other parents when they are looking for a leak proof cup. I can turn it upside down and shake it and barely a drop comes out. Please try for yourself but READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!,5,1
"Pink Fleece KinderKozy Baby Sleep Sack Wearable Blanket, Adjustable Straps, One Size fits Baby 3-9 months-by Baby Emporio","I purchased this for my new grandaughter.  I wanted something to keep her warm and grow with her. It was perfect. My daughter loved it so much ,I had to buy one for her home.",5,1
Safety 1st Prograde No Drill Top Of Door Lock,"As noted by others, its operation depends on squared-off door trim.  For our door, it works almost perfectly.  We don't have quite enough space with it installed to close the door all the way, but the features outweigh that problem. It is easy for adults to open from either side of the door.",4,1
"Cosco Umbrella Stroller, Butterfly Dreams","I love this stroller! It's a great price for a stylish, lightweight stroller. My son loves that he can see so much more from this stroller than his other one. I love that I can pop it into my trunk without even folding it closed.The only downfall is that this is a short stroller. I'm 5'2"" and it fits me perfectly height wise. But, it's hard for my husband to push around because he has to bend down to grasp the handles and he's only 5'11"".",4,1
"Hoppop Bato Bath Tub, Lime",I got the pink one and was more than pleased with my purchase it was just as pictured which dosnt happen often. perfect size  love the modern shape too. i heard a lot of reveiws on it being a little slippery but i just went to target and bought a fish shaped mat that was the same color and it was perfect.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Brentwood Baby Collection Rocker and Seat, Sea Green","I was able to get this product at a garage sale! and wow, what an amazing little bouncer. The vibration is perfectly subtle, and the music diverse, and calming. I play the music when he is in his crib as well, as its the only music he seems to like. The chair is versatile, locks in place, or rocks, can be placed on any hard surface, and is beautifully made. The best part is the built in timer, which shuts the chair off after awhile despite the setting. Love this chair, and highly recommend as a quality, beautifully made addition to your nursery.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Soft Spout Training Cup, 6 Ounce, Colors May Vary","My son is 6 moths old. He seemed to start taking an interest in our cups when we drank out of them so I thought I'd buy him his first sippy cup so he could practice. I didn't do much looking. We use Dr. Brown's bottles, so I just bought a Dr. Brown's sippy cup. The handles are perfect for his little, uncoordinated hands to grasp & the spout is sort of rubbery so he likes it in his mouth. I would recommend this for a baby. I think he will probably break the handles when he gets older & stronger though. They are not very sturdy.",5,1
"Summer Infant Snuzzler Velboa for Head and Body Support, Chocolate","This is excellent padding especially for your newborn in the carseat when they do not yet fit the seat enough. I love the reversible colors, mine is white and black and it works wonderfully! This washes beautifully too- I put on a gentle cycle and air dried and it came out as soft as it was originally. Another great feature is the velcro that connects the head and body attachment. You can use just the head support or body support by simply undoing the velcro that holds them together. This fits my Graco carseat perfectly and its awesome in my son's stroller (The First Years Wave Urban) as well for alittle added comfort. A great buy and a great item for all new moms. This is a GREAT gift to purchase for a shower, they will love it!",5,1
Sea Babies Printed Canvas Art - Set of 4 (10&quot; x 10&quot;),"These canvas pictures are absolutely adorable. They went perfectly with the baby nursery theme and the person I got it for loved them.Shipping could have been a bit quicker, but was pleased",4,1
"Infantino Wrap and Tie Baby Carrier, Black Blueberries","I bought this carrier when my daughter was about 4 weeks old; she's now 10 weeks old.  I had a Moby that I borrowed from a friend but could never quite get to work, and my daughter hated being in it.  I also have a Bjorn Active, but she seemed pretty precarious in that when she was so little.This carrier is nearly perfect for infants.  It's not quite as easy to put on as the Bjorn, but MUCH easier than the Moby, and it gives that nice snug fit that the Moby did.  It's much lighter weight than the Bjorn, so it's easier on my back.  I have the khaki-colored version, so I haven't had any problems with it showing dirt and dust.  I wish the straps weren't so long (one size fits all), but I just wrap them around to my back and tie them again loosely.  [I'm 5'4"" and 145 lbs.]  I think this carrier would fit most people.  The fabric is thick, and the construction seems to be of good quality. It might be hot in hot weather, but most carriers are.This has been a life saver.  My daughter won't sleep anywhere except while being held.  Now, once she's fed/diapered/etc and getting fussy (i.e., needs to sleep), I pop her in and walk around and sing.  After a couple of minutes of fussing, she is sound asleep, sometimes for several hours.  I can do a little light work around the house, plus I can sit and type at the computer (she's in the wrap right now).*******Update 8/1/2010--my daughter is now almost 5 months old, and this carrier still works great with her facing me for her naps.  She now weighs about 15 lbs, and it's not bad for a couple hours of use (especially if I can sit for part of the time).  She starts to strain my back when I have to walk around with her for a couple of hours, but less so than when she is forward-facing in the Bjorn Active.I have tried the face-out option, and it works OK, but I probable prefer to face her out in the Bjorn Active (it's quicker to put on).  The Wrap and Tie is a little tall for her facing out, so I have to try to scrunch down the front, and I worry about her falling asleep and having her nose down in it.  This carrier is definitely better than the Bjorn Active for facing-in naps (more support on the back of her neck so that her head doesn't flop around while she's sleeping).  A friend is sending me her Ergo, so I will compare all three once I've tried it.********Update 8/25/2010--Once I got the Ergo, I stopped using the Wrap and Tie.  Both hold the baby snug and close to me, facing in, for sleeping.  The Ergo is super easy to put on and great for my back.  I am now an Ergo convert.In summary---1) Infantino Wrap and Tie:  Pros = Great for little ones, facing in, for sleeping.  Easier to put on than the Moby and yet keeps baby nice and snug.  Can face baby out.  Sturdy.  Cheap (cheaper than other mei tai style carriers).  Not bad on my back.  Can ball it up and shove it in the diaper bag.  Cons = harder to put on than Bjorn/Ergo, not as good as the Bjorn for facing out, not as good on the back as the Ergo.2) Baby Bjorn (I have the Bjorn Active): Pros = My baby LOVES facing out when awake, and this is hands-down the best carrier for that.  I put up with back pain to keep my baby happy.  Cons: Not as good as the Wrap and Tie or Ergo for facing in/sleeping.  Hurts my back to wear it for long (baby now ~15 lbs).  Expensive.3) Ergo: Pros = Quick and easy to put on, perfect for baby facing in/sleeping, cute little hood to put over her head to block out light while sleeping, AWESOME!!!! for my back.  Cons = Expensive, baby can't face out.  (My baby doesn't much like facing in while awake but she's getting used to it.)When I go out, I usually take both the Ergo and the Bjorn with me in the car, and then pick whichever one is appropriate for my baby at the moment.  If you have enough cash to drop on both (or better yet, can get them used or hand-me-down), get both and skip the Wrap and Tie.  If you only have enough $ for one carrier, the Wrap and Tie might work.*****final update--others have commented on the baby's face being smushed into their chest in the facing-in position.  I haven't had a problem with this, but I frequently check my baby's neck position to make sure that her chin is tilted up a bit and her nose is pointing up a bit.  It's easy to look down at her and reposition her head when appropriate.  Also, I usually have her in with the binky in her mouth, which keeps her face off my chest as well.",5,1
Green Toys BPA-Free Feeding Spoon,i dont know why but the spoons are like the perfect size and shape and they make feeding my 7 month old daughter so much easier and less messy...i love these!,5,1
"Delta Canton Full Size Wood Bed Rails, Black","This is an excellent product to convert your Delta Canton crib into a bed.  It comes with all necessary parts, screws and angles to be used right away.  The color was a perfect match to existing pieces.",5,1
Jeep Backseat Organizer,I bought this becasue my Jeep doesn't have pockets behind the seat so this is perfect for my little things i like to stow away.,5,1
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Quarter Moon","I had tried the Mobi GloMate and it was a terrible disappointment. Only lasted a month or 2 and even from the beginning it was never sturdy on the base. I also tried the Dinosaur night light LED sold here on amazon, but my kids couldn't operate it in the middle of the night so it was useless. This is cute and adorable, functional and practical (in that my 4 year old and 2 year olds who wake up scared sometimes know how to just grab it and walk safely to our bedroom). This light is perfect because it is easy to use and reliable.",5,1
Large Tub Guard,"I bought this to cushion the side of my tub, so when my unsteady baby would slip or fall from a standing position I would not have to worry about her cracking her head on the side of the tub. I bought this in desperate need, after watching her crack her head two days in a row in the tub. This product is really perfect. Now when she falls I still hold my breath but I know that there will not be a bruise the next day. I even bought one for my parents house for when we visit.",5,1
"Mimi The Sardine Bib with Dots Design, Blue/Green","I bought two Mimi the Sardine bibs over a year and a half ago and still use them occasionally.  They are in near perfect condition due their durability and ease of wash.  Better yet, they don't smell like plastic (because they're cotton, lol) and and don't fall apart like the cheaper quality bibs.  I highly recommend them.  I would suggest buying a darker color since some foods like carrots can stain the lighter colored bibs.",5,1
JUST ONE YOU&#153; Made by Carter's &reg; White 4 in 1 Crib,I bought this crib as a second crib for my son so he had one at my mother in laws house. It is perfect for what we needed and easy to put together.,4,1
Nuby 4-Pack Hot Safe Spoons,Can't have to many of these. They are the perfect length and they don't loose their grip. All infants need these.,5,1
Nuby 8 oz No Spill Convert-A-Cup,"This is the perfect sippy cup. I wanted a cup with a spout that was soft like a bottle nipple but could help my baby gradually graduate to harder sippy cups. I love this. She figured out how to use the spout within three tries and she loved it. I plan to use this cup for awhile with the spout, then move to a cup with a harder nipple or straw, then come back to this as a regular open top cup. It's easy to clean. No valves!! Only three parts and the lid slips on so easily. We don't have to worry about twitting the lid on or the threads getting damaged from use or cleaning.",5,1
"Kissa's Pail Liner, White","I have not tried other wet bags for cloth diapers but I highly recommend this one. It is extra large and fits a standard sized kitchen trash can (13 gal) perfectly. I only have 30 cloth diapers and I have to wash the load well before I actually fill it up. I turn the bag inside out to dump everything in, then throw the bag in with the diapers for the whole wash cycle. Then I hang it to dry. It dries quickly and it ready to use. It is truly leak proof as it gathers water in the wash so I have to empty it before hanging. I also have not had any problems with odor coming from my trash can...although I use one with a lid. I would definitely recommend this item.",5,1
"Baby Girl Pink Initial Chenille Blanket with Satin Ruffle, Letter E","I bought this adorable blanket for my niece Ella, who will be arriving in May and it is absolutely precious! The colors are fantastic and the initial monogram is very well done and perfect for a little princess...I love Mudpie products and Amazon is one of the most reasonable outlets for their products compared to several boutiques and gift shops I frequent...Fantastic gift and I cant wait to give it to my brand new niece!",5,1
"Mud Pie Baby Classic Keepsakes Silver-Plate Rattle, Cross","Also bought the blue rattle, these are perfect baby gifts, Everyone loves them, Very beautiful and a great value. Have purchased more for the summer shower gifts I needed.",5,1
"Disney Baby Propack LX Travel System, New Ambrosia","I haven't had any problems with my stroller or with the car seat. After reading the previous review, I am a little confused. My son weighed 7.5 pounds at birth and fit perfectly in the car seat. At 13 pounds, he still does. I even have to tighten him in and put the excess strap under the seat. I think Disney did great with this product and I am very happy with it. No complaints.",5,1
"Imse Vimse Water Shoes (06-12, Pink)",I bought these for my 8 month old grand daughter who is not yet walking and they are simply perfect for her.  Since she is not walking yet I can't comment on how they will be for walking.  But their elasticity allows for the shoe to stay on and stay put.  Love them.,5,1
Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Baby Wipes Refill 350ct.,"I don't have a baby; however, like many adults, I use baby wipes in the car to clean my hands and while camping as toilet paper or as a shower substitute. For my purpose, these wipes are perfect.7th Generation is a brand I've trusted for years. They may not make the BEST environmentally sound products, there are certainly above average and that's enough to relieve my guilt. :)",5,1
"Summer Infant Convertible Tote Diaper Bag, Tan","The diaper bag is super cute!  My husband wanted a bag that he wouldn't mind holding and this one is perfect!  Very cute without being too girly.  However, after less then a week the zipper to the main compartment broke.  The velcro that holds the front pocket down doesn't hold very well unless the bag is pretty much empty.  The flap is always coming undone.  I love how roomy the bag is and how it has the special ""changing compartment"".  But I am going to have to replace the zipper and add a bigger strip of velcro.",4,1
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,We started out using the bulb and our son's nose would get red and sore. We were so glad to find this product! It isn't perfect but its pretty close!,5,1
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"This is the perfect solution to get the bats out of the cave.  It is much more comfortable for our kids than the suckers from the hospital.  Also, you are in control as to the suction used.",5,1
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"This was exactly the right thing at the right time for our kids.  We have twins, and this little beauty was perfect.  Now mind you, I never used it because it grossed me out, but the wife swears by it, so I'm writing this on her behalf.  Easy to clean, works extremely well for its intended purpose.  Tried other brands but this one was the best.",5,1
Hooter Hiders Cotton Nursing Cover - Avignon,This thing is perfect!  The stiff ring in it works great to be able to see the baby while feeding.  I have been using it for five months and has been through several washings.  It has held up great.  Don't hesitate by one for yourself and all of your friends!!,5,1
Maclaren Rain Cover - Triumph/Quest,"Originally when we bought this rain cover, we thought it was too small.  It took a small army to fit it over the stroller and attach it properly. Over time it has stretched and now I think it is the perfect size.  Once on, it works great to keep out rain/snow or wind, and I would feel comfortable taking my daughter out on a very cold, rainy, or snowy day.  Totally worth the money becuase it adds value to your stroller because it allows you to take your kid out for a walk on a crappy day where you would normally be stuck inside.  Good buy!!",5,1
"Planet Wise Hanging Wet/Dry Diaper Bag, Black","I use a rather fancy gym bag (Ogio FlexForm F3) and would prefer not to &#34;soil&#34; it with my sweaty post-workout clothes. This is the perfect solution! Just don't tell your friends it's a diaper bag! Completely seals in moisture, or seals in dry clothes when there's moisture outside. I can also envision using this for hiking, since my backpack isn't waterproof but sometimes I want to store a change of clothes and ensure they stay dry over multiple days, rain or shine.My only very minor gripe is the zipper. It would be nice to have a zipper pull. It doesn't appear to be a very rugged zipper, but it works fine so far. Also, because of the zipper closure, it's not tape-seamed, meaning over a long time there will be some moisture release through the zipper. I don't care about this, since I'm not looking for something completely waterproof and submersible here (that's a totally different class of bags, see Sea and Summit).",5,1
"Planet Wise Hanging Wet/Dry Diaper Bag, Black","I never really use the dry pocket of the diaper bag, but I  think the size is perfect.  Planet Wise has such cute patterns.  The only negative I can think of is that when washing, sometimes the inner liner will hold water, even if you pull it outward beforehand.  Not a big complaint though.  Love this bag.",4,1
"Planet Wise Hanging Wet/Dry Diaper Bag, Black","This is our third of these bags (we like to have 2 in rotation and our dog ate one so we replaced it) and we've been really happy with them.  They keep odors of our cloth diapers well contained.  We send them to daycare each day with clean in the outside zip pocket and they send it home with the dirty on the inside lined zip pocket.  We wash them about once a week and they hold up every well.  My only wish is that the straps were longer, or there were two sets of straps, so I could sling them over a shoulder when I bring them to and from daycare.  The current set of straps is a perfect height for hanging the bag on a door handle.",4,1
"Planet Wise Hanging Wet/Dry Diaper Bag, Black","Perfect wet bag!  It's very stylish, but also functional.  It's held 2 days worth of cloth diapers & there's no smell that comes from it.  It's also easy to clean.  The only down side is that the zipper is not easy to hold with one hand.",5,1

Tuc Tuc Little Koala Girl. Soft Plush Infant Baby Rattle and Teething Toy. Koala Collection.,"Perfect complement to the TucTuc koala plush toy.  Babies love to stick things into their mouths, and this is at least soft and cuddly at the top and not harshly hard at the bottom where it rattles.  Softer, safer fun.",5,1

Engel Organic Merino Virgin Wool Nappy Pants-Natural-74/80 (6-12 mo),Very nice thin cover.  Great for day use and short trips if heavily lanolized.  Will be perfect for potty learning.,5,1
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green","This brush has been perfect for cleaning bottles, nipples, pump parts, etc. I really like that it cleans the nipple easily and also that it has it's own stand instead of a suction cup at the bottom since those seem more likely to fall over more frequently!",5,1
"OXO Tot Feeding Spoon Set, Green","My 4 month old daughter is strictly breast fed but we decided to introduce rice cereal this week. I'm glad I chose these spoons! Totally worth the money, they scoop perfect amounts for her and the design allows for easy transfers. She's teething, so she would bite down and the silicone is easy on her gums yet very durable. Seriously, LOVE these spoons, BUT (and I know this sounds silly) I loved the pretty aqua color seen in the picture. I did not receive aqua. They look dark blue. That is my only knock on these guys. But I can totally live with that, these were an amazing buy.",4,1
"OXO Tot Fork and Spoon Set, Green","My son is 2 years old and we've been trying to find the perfect ""grown-up"" utensils for him.  These are absolutely perfect!! They are easy to clean, sturdy and my son has so much success with them.  I will be purchasing at least one more set if not 2 in the near future!",5,1
"OXO Tot 4-Piece Feeding Set, Green",This was fabulous.  He uses these items every time he's at our house.  The fork and spoon are perfect for little hands that are getting more used to handling utensils for eating.  They're great quality as well as trendy looking.  We love all of it.,5,1
"OXO Tot 4-Piece Feeding Set, Green","I love this feeding set. My baby girl (14 month) use the plate and bowl to eat blueberry, raspberry, watermelon, cheese, blackberry....it works perfect!! The spoon and fork are very safe too.The price is reasonable and the quality of this product is very good!!",4,1
"OXO Tot Flip-Top Snack Cup, Green, 5 Ounce",This fits perfectly in my car cup holder and works great when I need to take a longer trip. I also love that the sides are labeled,5,1
"Summer Infant Quickchange Portable Changing Pad, Black","This is a great changing pad. Folds great, fits in a diaper bag perfect. Size is perfect,and you can't beat the price.  Great Product.",5,1
"Summer Infant Quickchange Portable Changing Pad, Black","My husband didn't understand the need for a portable (wipe-able!) changing pad like this and said a towel should work just fine...until my son had a blowout while we were out and about.  You can turn just about any flat surface into a changing table. This folds up to a nice size and fits in a small diaper bag or tote.  It cleans up easily too!  The size is perfect big enough, but not too big.  I had ordered another one and returned it for this one.  You can't beat the price either! I think this would be great to stash if your car too.",5,1
"Summer Infant Custom Fit Walk-Thru Gate, Tan",We have four different baby gates and this one is by far my favorite. It is perfect for unusual places. We first installed it so it blocked off the play room but have since moved it to block off the entrance to the living room. I love the flexibility of this gate. This is a must buy!,5,1
"OXO Tot Tub Drain Stopper, Blue","This item is fantastic it was perfect for my tub in my apartment. It's great for old tubs in old apt buildings. It suctions well, the water doesn't go done unless your ready for it to go down. It doesn't suction against the tub well for storage works extremely well as a stopper.",5,1
"OXO Tot Baby Food Freezer Tray, White/Green","I bought these to freeze my homemade baby food and I love them. Great price for a great product. No, as other reviewers say, the lid does not fit snug but that doesnt matter to me. I put the lid on only to stack in freezer and as soon as they are frozen, I remove them from the tray and put into vacuum seal bags. You can try saran wrap if that is a problem for you..These make making homemade baby food so easy to freeze into perfect portions!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.**Note: I ruined my first tray by digging out frozen cubes with a knife. Bad idea. I scraped up the bottom of each little section and had to replace the whole tray so there wasn't jagged plastic. Now, I take the tray from the freezer and leave it on the counter juuust long enough for them to thaw around the edges so they are loose and easy to remove. I have also run the bottom of the tray under hot water for a sec and they pop right out!",5,1
"OXO Tot Baby Food Freezer Tray, White/Green","This is pretty much an ice cube tray with a lid- but I like it much better than the fancier versions because the cubes are in the perfect portion and they are easy to get out! The seal is not super tight, but I haven't had any issues. Best part is how easy to clean it is.",4,1
"OXO Tot Baby Food Freezer Tray, White/Green","We have been making baby food for about 4 months now, and this tray has been everything we hoped it would be.  After all, it's essentially an ice cube tray with a lid.  No, it is not a long-term storage container because the lid does not seal tightly. If I leave cubes in there more than a week, I will see freezer burn.  Since I cook ahead on weekends, I usually freeze food in the trays and then pop them into a freezer bag.  I mix and match foods all week, so I prefer to have several different foods at the ready.  I find that one tray holds four small-medium apples or pears perfectly.  A medium butternut squash is a little too large to fit all in one tray.  To handle the overflow, we also have some freezer pots that we use, but truth be told I prefer the tray because the 1-oz portions are perfect for mixing different foods (and now that my daughter is 9 months old we had to get a second tray).  In the morning I just pop a few cubes into a larger container, and they are thawed by the time she needs to eat at school.  Great for a working mom who wants to provide home-cooked food!Tip - sometimes the cubes do ""stick"" in the tray, so I use a chopstick to push on one end and they pop out perfectly.  The chopstick doesn't damage the tray - works great for me!",4,1
"North States Supergate Extra Tall Easy Close Gate, Bronze","I give this gate 5 stars because I have tried a LOT of pressure-mounted gates, and although this one is not perfect, it is the best one I've had overall. The extra height turned out to be very valuable for us, as our son is extremely tall. The gate is very study: our son has grabbed the bars and shaken them hard, and the mounting has held firm, and the gate has not opened. The color and styling is good - it blends nicely with our decor and I've actually received some compliments on its aesthetics. My favorite feature is the bi-directional swing. You don't have to think about how you're going to open it, and older children can operate it safely without worry that a toddler will figure it out. It is definitely a one-handed opening, and the auto-close is extremely convenient. Nicely adjusts to openings of varying widths.Like all pressure-mounted swing gates, this gate isn't going to install correctly if you have shoe molding along your baseboards. The bottom cross-bar needs to be flat against the floor for stability, so you can't raise it up above the shoe molding or the baseboard molding. The rubber-edged tension knobs do need to be adjusted occasionally after frequent use if you install this on a hardwood floor, but less often than similar gates made by First Years. Because the gate is styled nicely, the opening mechanism is less obvious to elderly relatives and new guests to the house. They will instinctively bang on the gate or lift up without using the button/slide. This will work but it will impact the tension over time, and requiring tightening.I feel comfortable installing this at the bottom of stairs, but less so at the top (a general concern with pressure-mounted gates). The bottom cross-beam is a little high, and at the top of the stairs most people don't instinctively raise their feet high enough to clear it, so it's actually more of a potential hazard for adults to catch their feet on the lip.I would buy this gate again.",5,1
"North States Supergate Extra Tall Easy Close Gate, Bronze",I love this gate!  It is just what I needed to keep my overly anxious new pup away from the cats.  My dog weighs about 30 lbs and I am very rough with this gate going in and out of the room.  It has held up perfect.  It looks and performs the same as the day I put it up.,5,1
"North States Supergate Extra Tall Easy Close Gate, Bronze","I ordered two of these gates to keep our small dogs (weight range 8-20 pounds) in and out of certain areas of the house. For the past year or so we had been using the typical $10, 2-feet-tall, wood/plastic-lattice baby gates you can find at Walmart, Target, etc. We just left them up all the time and had to climb over them. In addition to being unattractive, I was really tired of having to climb over them. Plus, we recently got 2 kittens who can easily scamper up the lattice-style mesh of the other gates, so I wanted to find something that they couldn't climb. I spent an afternoon looking up just about every type of gate out there. What finally sold me on this one was the height, the price, and the color.Once the gate arrived, I had it in place in about 10 minutes. I did not use the wall cups; I just have the tension ""stoppers"" up against the wall. This is working just fine. I am very happy that I chose the 36"" high gate rather than the 30"" high one, because 36"" is kind of the perfect hand-height. I think at 30"" I would have to bend down a little bit to reach the top of the gate.The gate opens via a 2-part process. First, you use your finger to slide a piece backwards, then you lift up on the gate and swing it in either direction. Because we are using the gates for pets and not children, I slid the piece back and then wrapped a rubber band around it to keep it back. That way all we have to do to open the gate is just the lift-up step. This is perfect for us and makes the gate that much easier to use.I love that it opens in both directions and that if you open it all the way it ""stays open"", or if you just open it part of the way it swings closed behind you. I really wanted one that was capable of staying open, since really, we need the gates open more often than closed. The color is called ""bronze"" by the manufacturer, but I think it's really just a shimmery, metallic chocolate brown. It is very tasteful. Everyone who has seen them has commented on how nice they look.My husband frequently thinks my purchases are ""unnecessary"", so I didn't run this by him before I bought them. ;-) He just came home one day to see that two of the old baby gates had been replaced with these. His first comment was, ""Wow, these look a heck of a lot nicer."" Within a day, he was singing their praises and telling me to order enough of them to replace ALL of the old gates. So I think that's probably the best testament to how nice this gate is.The one and only negative I can think of is that there is a ""warning"" sticker along the bottom of both sides of the gate that is REALLY stuck on there, and I can't get it off. So my pretty brown gate has an ugly white sticker along the bottom of both sides. Obviously I would prefer it not be there, or that they had used some sort of less-sticky adhesive so I could peel it off. But, it's not annoying enough for me to take off a star from this otherwise fantastic gate!",5,1
"North States Supergate Extra Tall Easy Close Gate, Bronze","This was super easy to install, you can either use screws to secure it or not. If you don't use the screw set up it is perfectly solid.  This is tall enough that my dog can't jump it.  He also tried batting it out of the way as well and it held up without moving.  I would recommend this to anyone whether for dogs or kids.",5,1
"North States Supergate Extra Tall Easy Close Gate, Bronze","I have purchased 3 different gates to block puppy from front entrance and this is the best one by far. It swings both ways, also can be set to stay open, it's perfect! Can't say enough about this gate. Thank you.",5,1
"North States Supergate Extra Tall Easy Close Gate, Bronze","This gate was placed in a hallway to keep a grandchild out of our bedroom, office, and guest bathroom. In that regard it works perfectly. My one concern was whether it would prevent our cat from getting to her food and litterbox, however she jumps over it easily.The installation, especially with the extensions, can be tricky. I laid the gate down on the carpet, fitted the pins and extensions on, then used the plastic protective wrapping to tie the extensions to the gate frame. Another piece was used to hold the gate in the closed position. This made the assembly much easier to manage.My installation process went as follows. 1) With a 36"" level, make two pencil marks slightly above where the disks will go. Use a roofing square or other large right angle to transfer a matching baseboard mark to the other side. Don't bother making the other mark on the other part of the wall.Dry fit the cups on the first wall centered under the marks. Fasten the baseboard cup to the wall. Dry fit the upper cup and fasten that in place next. Now place the baseboard cup on the other side. At this point, start extending the screws for the pressure fit. Keeping the upper gate frame free on the opposite side will allow you to make the small adjustments for the gate to close square. Once that's achieved, mark where the cup is set, tilt the gate down, fasten the cup to the wall, and retighten the pressure screws.",5,1
Stroll-Air Double Stroller Organizer,"After a ton of research and seemingly few good double stroller options, I settled on this without much to go on the way of reviews. I wanted something that would span the entire width of our double stroller's handle bar and this turned out to fit perfectly. The Velcro straps actually have alot more length to stretch further if needed. I'm able to secure the straps tight enough so that the console holds pretty rigid, without sagging or moving across the entire width. It would work even better with the regular City Mini double stroller, which has a perpendicular bar in the center of the handle bar. The console has two separate storage compartments with space in between them to rest over that perpendicular bar. The cup holders are big enough to securely hold large drinks, like the souvenir cups at Six Flags. The storage compartments have a lot of space for all of multiple wallets, phones, keys, maps, sunglasses, and snacks to fit with room to spare. The magnets that secure the compartment covers could be stronger, but are fine for when the stroller is in use. I don't think they'll hold well when the stroller is folded up and there are still items in the pockets, but we don't keep anything stored in there when the stroller isn't in use so it's not a problem for us.",5,1
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","So, I bought this carseat after watching it for a few days and the price had dropped about $10 extra overnight! (LOVE Amazon's prices on things! Babies R Us is charging about $80 OVER Amazon on this same seat!) I was a little nervous because I didn't have the chance to go down to my local Babies R Us and see if it would actually FIT in my cars; I have a 2008 Scion xB and a 2001 Honda Civic sedan. I read a lot of the reviews and found that they fit perfectly....in SUV's and minivans! This added to my nervousness. I KNEW I wanted this seat, but I was concerned with the fact that it just might not fit in our cars. We got the seat day before last and it fits WONDERFULLY...in BOTH cars! So, for all those out there who have smaller cars, but what their child in THIS seat, fear not and buy with confidence. Britax is a great brand, we have had our girls in Britax seats since birth and that will continue to be the case until they no longer need car seats :)",5,1
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock",We purchased two for our 3 year old twin daughters. Other reviews helped our decision and were right on. This is a great car seat for the growing child. There is enough recline for comfort and to avoid head falling when they fall asleep. The girls love them.  They are petite at just under 30 pounds and it fits them perfectly. I highly recommend for this age and onward.,5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","We purchased this lunch box to match the Skiphop owl backpack my daughter received for Christmas. It's unbelievably cute, well made, and useful. I'm glad we went ahead and got this eventhough she will not eat lunch at school till next school year.  We've used it a couple times already and it's the perfect size for younger kids to handle.",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","I'm a sucker for cute things. This lunch box is great because it is not only cute, but functionable as well.While this isn't a great lunchbox for wide thermoses of soup, it does great for a sandwich, veggies, and drink. I think that it's a perfect size for children or lighter eaters. I usually used it with a small ice-pack, but it is well-insulated and keeps cold food items cold. I have not used it with hot items.I love the bungee pouch, which i use to store my utensils and ice pack.",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","Someone said this thing is too small. Their kid must eat foot long hoagies or something, because it's the perfect size for an ice pack, sandwich, a small Tupperware of fruit of sliced vegetables, and a small water bottle (or juice box... or chocolate milk if you want you rid to get fat/stay fat).The bag keeps food cold if you put an ice pack in there, it's built well, and the designs are cute. The handle is even adjustable and has a snap-on thing, so you can clip it to a bag or a bike rack or something.",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey",Love it!  Perfect for my 3 year old to carry and have his lunch. Highly recommend. The skip hop back pack too.,5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","Can you have too many Skip Hop Zoo products? They are all SO adorable. My 2yr old may or may not have about six sets (lunchie & backpack) of different SH animals haha. They are just perfect and so cute. Also, we used a different brand lunch box one day to bring snacks to the zoo and I didn't realize how spoiled I'd become with the SH lunchies. The clip on the top strap is SO useful. You can clip it to the diaper bag, backpack, stroller handle etc. That is a VERY useful feature so you don't have one more thing to hold!",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey",Very much loved by the little first who received this item as a gift. The perfect size for a young child's lunch. Very nice quality and it is very well made.,5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","These combination set is perfect for my 14 month old daughter.  She proudly wears her backpack which is a little too large for her right now, but she makes work.  For those that complain about the size... I can fit diapers, wipes, spare clothing, shoes and other times in backpack.  The lunchie holds a cold pack, two small bottles, 2oz jar of food, spoon and bib.  Its prefect for a quick short trip or a play date. They are two separate items meant to be carried separately and not one inside the other.  If your child needs to carry more items for school or an all day love affair, then buy a JanSport. ( I still have mine after 30+ years.)  The quality is nice, but the zipper tie broke off backpack which was an easy fix.  My only complaint is the lunchie box, but it is minor. The owls ears are sewn in such a way that they point toward the body of the box which catches the zipper when trying to close it, so you have to lift his ears out of the way.  I still rated it 5 star based on overall cute factor.",5,1
"Growing Up Green Wood Step Stool, Natural","This little foot stool is exactly what I need to rest my feet.  My legs are too short to reach the floor for some living room chairs - this provides the perfect height to give me support.  Strong, nice looking.  I would recommend - definately.",5,1
"Carters 5-Piece Girls Diaper Bag Set - brown/pink, one size",Bought this for my wife and she love's it alot great diaper bag pretty color's we have two little girls so it worked perfectly btw speedy delivery,5,1
"Thirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boy","These wipes work really well.  I use them for cleaning my son's bum at diaper changes, and even with messy poops I almost always just need one.  They wash well, maybe shrink a small amount so the edges aren't perfectly even anymore, but I&#34;m using them for his bum so I don't care.  Same with the colors - I got exactly what's pictured, but it really makes no difference to me.",5,1
Wee Gallery Art Cards and Mobile Set - Original,"Having a background in child development I specifically went looking for picture cards for my three month old to look at.  The Wee Gallery cards have been perfect.  My daughter was captivated by the cards immediately and continues to enjoy them months later.  Because the cards are durable I was able to tape them in various places. (Above her changing table, over the bouncy seat, on mobiles, etc). As she grows older I imagine my daughter will be happy to hold and interact with the cards herself.  Young children can be over stimulated by loud electronic toys with too many lights and colors.  These simple cards have been my baby's first and best learning &#34;toy&#34; so far.",5,1
"Eddie Bauer Wood High Chair, Michelle, Cherry wood","This is a beautiful piece of furniture that blends in very nicely with our dining room. However, I should note that the ""Eddie Bauer"" logo, as well as the piping on the seat cover are pink. It looks so unisex in the picture, I didn't even think twice about it being for a girl. I guess the name ""Michelle"" should have tipped me off. Nevertheless, our little guy will still be using this gorgeous, albeit somewhat feminine, highchair. I have not used this highchair enough yet to give a detailed review of the functionality of the chair; however, I am looking forward to using it more.***UPDATE*** 08-14-2013So, we've been using this high chair for about a year and a half, and it definitely has some pro's and con's. I haven't noticed any of the ""comfort issues"" that some of the negative reviewers have mentioned - my son has always acted perfectly comfortable in it. In fact, I got sick of trying to keeping the padded cover off to wash, so I just removed it completely when he was about 18 months old, and he still seems comfortable. I actually like the fact that the top tray removes. There are a lot of days where I serve breakfast, and don't get around to fully cleaning the top tray until later in the day. On those days, it is very handy to just remove the top tray and let him eat lunch on the bottom portion. I will say that with all of the wood slats, it is difficult to keep this high chair clean - but I'm sure that is the case with most high chairs. I do also like that the trays are dishwasher safe. The little diddy in the description that claims, ""Convenient mealtime storage is out of baby's reach"" is somewhat laughable. If you have a toddler, you know what I mean. Overall, if you want a highchair that blends in with traditional furniture - the ""cons"" are probably worth it for this chair.",4,1
"OsoCozy 6 Pack Prefolds Unbleached Cloth Diapers, Size 1",I bought these prefolds to use as an insert for size medium Gdiapers. They are perfect. They wash well and do not stain easily. Overall pleased with this purchase.,4,1
"OsoCozy 6 Pack Prefolds Unbleached Cloth Diapers, Size 1","We have a pile of cute burp cloths that people bought us for our daughter. Pinks, greens, blues, and everything in between, most with cute embroidery and sayings. The problem? They don't work! They absorb nothing, hold nothing, and generally work like garbage. Our little spit up machine needs a lot more than a burp cloth that seems to be impervious to absorbing milk.Enter these prefolds - we bought a pack of the size 2, and love them. They're super soft, so I don't feel bad wiping her face, and they actually absorb a large amount of spitup. We keep them in the diaper bag, around the crib, and all around the house. It makes cleanup so much easier than before. I'll definitely invest in more soon.As compared to the Gerber ""cloth diapers"" there's no comparison. These are well knit, thick material, and very soft. They're perfect.",5,1
"OsoCozy 6 Pack Prefolds Unbleached Cloth Diapers, Size 1",I am a mom who is new to cloth diapering and I love these cloth diapers. They absorb really well after the recommended 2-3 washes and are the perfect size. I like how they are unbleached as well.,5,1
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Ocean Blue, Size One (6-18 lbs)","I can't say enough on how happy I am thirsties came up with a snapping cover. My trusty velcro covers were falling apart and looking YUCKY. I was almost ready to give up on thirsties... and then my snapping cover!!! I LOVE these. I've been using them now for over a month. They are wonderful. If you can sew, look up Rita Rump's free diaper design, I made about 20 diapers with this design and they work PERFECT under this cover. LOVE THEM. THANK YOU THIRSTIES FOR GIVING ME SNAPS!!!",5,1
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Ocean Blue, Size One (6-18 lbs)","I really like these cute little covers. They fit perfectly over daytime prefolds. However, be advised that they are not as large as the elastic version, and won't fit well over the heavier nighttime diapers by the time your baby reaches 12 pounds or so.",4,1
"OXO Tot Snack Disk, Green","I love OXO products so I was thrilled to find their baby/kids line. I despise babyish looking items in pinks with cartoon characters on them, so it was very refreshing to find this OXO snack cup in a gorgeous bright green with a modern look. Finally a snack cup that doesn't scream ""baby!"" The cup itself is extremely durable and has survived numerous falls. The lid always stays intact during the falls, ensuring no snacks are lost. I love the rubber bottom to prevent sliding and I love how the top portion is clear on the outside so you can see what is inside. The size is perfect for our kids to hold and reach their little hands into to feed themselves. The only gripe I have is that I wish there was some sort of leash to attach the lid to the cup.  Our kids have misplaced the lids numerous times and its really frustrating not to be able to use the cup because you can't locate the lid. Other than that, it's another perfect OXO product.",4,1
"OXO Tot Snack Disk, Green","I like that there is an air tight lid. That way when your little one doesn't eat all the goldfish, they don't have to be put in another container or go stale. I also like that the lid and top of the disc are see-thru. Very hard to spill, even for a two year old. Love the non-slip base and low shape.... it makes it really hard to spill. It's very easy to clean, and nicely shaped. The opening is the perfect size and the container isn't bulky. It easily fits in my purse or diaper bag, and you can stack them on top of each other for storage. Can't say enough about it! Finally a hard to spill snack cup without those pointy, hard to clean plastic flaps. Highly recommend!",5,1
"OXO Tot Sprout Chair, Orange/Birch",I just purchased this chair for my 11 month old baby.  This highchair is the perfect feeding chair - there are three different hight adjustments for the chair and the steps can be adjusted as well.  The foaming on the chair is nice and soft - while it is easy to wipe away messes.  The only CON I have so far - the tray is not as deep as I would like - food can easily slide off the tray - but that is a minor complaint!  This chair looks beautiful in our kitchen.  Another nice bonus with this chair - there are nice foam pads on the bottom to prevent scratching of the wood floors!  The price was steep but it is worth the price.  Buy Buy Baby sells these chairs - and using a 20% coupon - we purchased this chair for a steal.,4,1
"Chicco Cortina Together Double Stroller, Fuego","We have had this stroller for 2 years. I power walk with it 5 miles a day, 5 days a week year round (except snow/ice) so it gets a lot of use. My children are now almost 4 (35 lbs) and almost 2 (25 lbs). We have been using it since my 23 month old was born with her chicco infant carrier. I am so happy with the durability of the stroller for the price that I paid. I would recommend it to anyone. It has been on several airplane trips (I always detach the front canopy and pack it in our large suitcase) and it has been used everywhere from Disney World to the North Carolina Beaches to the mountains of Utah. I have had not problems with any parts not meeting my standards and at 5 miles a day, I feel that I am putting it to the test. We use two JJ cole bundle bags and a double tandem stroller weather shield in the cold and rain. I purchased the weather shield from one step ahead. It does not fit perfectly, but does the trick unless it is really pouring. Hope the accessories are helpful for anyone looking. I highly recommend this stroller!",5,1
"Mommy's Helper Inflatable Bath Tub Froggie Collection, White/Green, 6-18 Months",I would defentely would recommend this tub!!! She was kinda short for her age but developed normal for her age group so a small inflatable tub was perfect. While I used the tub at home I kept it inflated but while traveling it was perfect! Whether you have a baby boy or girl this tub is great. You have option to blow up the small device that sits in between the legs or not. As she got bigger and more sturdy I deflated that piece of the tub. 5 stars!!!,5,1
"Personalized Martial Arts Belt Holder, Any Custom Name to 12 Characters","This is so so cool! Both my kids are in Taekwondo and this was a Christmas gift for them...they loved it!! They are always so happy when the advance a belt to now proudly display their achievement. The only draw back is we need more spaces for more belts. Like 4 or 5 more, but other than that...it's perfect,",4,1
Dry Eyes Shampoo Visor 2 Pack,"These work great.  My almost 3 year old throws tantrums every time water gets in his eyes, or he even suspects it might be headed that direction.  I've struggled with bath times with him for as long as I can remember - every time we wash his hair there is crying and flailing involved.  Those special pitchers didn't work, nor did showers - washcloths weren't effective.  It was an ordeal every time.  Well, no more!  He loves the visor.  It adjusts to fit perfectly and keeps water out completely.  The quality is great.  Thick and sturdy while still being comfortable.  I cannot recommend this enough.",5,1
Ameda Standard Breast Shield Flange,"After reading the other comments, I was hesitant about purchasing this item. The only problem was I needed it. So I went ahead and gave it a shot.

Bla bla kids Mini Mcnuttie the Squirrel,"Squirrel McNuttie is indeed a silly-looking character, with his buck-teeth and wild-eyed look. While most stuffed animals look sort of demure and innocent, Squirrel McNuttie looks like he has mischief in mind. We chose him as an alternative animal for our 2-year old's Easter basket this year because she, like McNuttie, is mischievous, and because of her love for Beatrix Potter's irreverant character, Nutkin. Besides, we have far too many lambs and bunnies, and squirrels are springtime-like. Sort of.He's a nice size for a little kid at 12"" length, perfectly doll-like, while I imagine his larger variation is a drag-along-the-floor kind of size at a generous 18"". His body is knitted sweater-like cotton, made by Peruvian artisans who are paid fair wages. Thus the cost. He is body is stuffed with polyester - and though I wish it were a more natural substance, this does make him more easily washable. He's already been through our wash once on the gentle cycle, as I always wash plush toys before giving them to the kids. He came through brilliantly, and I was pleased to see that his tail and ear tufts separated a bit and fluffed in a more attractive way post-washing. We air-dried him, which only took a few hours, and that was indoors. On a sunny day I doubt he'd take more than an hour to dry outside.Because he's stuffed with polyester, his body is extremely soft, mooshy and lightweight. My daughter seems to like him, and insisted he join her for bedtime and naptime. We had him act out the part of impertinent Nutkin, dancing like a sunbeam and so on, when we read her book at bedtime, and she was delighted by that.Overall, he is exactly what I expected and hoped for, and I am quite pleased with him. I'll definitely be buying more BlaBla dolls in the future.",5,1
6Pcs Japanese Iwako Erasers-Elephants,"I love elephants, so when I saw these elephant erasers at an affordable price I jumped on the offer right away and purchased the little cuties, haha :D They arrived earlier than expected, which is always a pleasant surprise. Mine came in light green, red, grey, pink, purple, and yellow. They were all cute, and it is quite amusing switching their trunks, heads, and bodies. As far as erasers go, they get the job done and erase very smoothly. I personally wouldn't want to use them as erasers, since they're so cute, but they do work well if you're curious or bought them to use as erasers ;). They are great for collectors and children, along with everyone else. A perfect value and totally adorable! :)",5,1
"Gund Baby Froggers Comfy Cozy, Green",I ordered this froggy lovey to serve as a stand-in when I needed to wash the other. I must not have read the product description to the end because I was very suprised when I pulled this very large frog lovey out of the box. It is actually more like a small blankey - perfect for dolls. But my 2 year old daughter saw it before I could stash it or return it and it now travels with her as ""big froggy"" along with ""little froggy."",4,1
Harper Paige Large Mum Flower Headband,"I absolutely adore this headband!  It is a vibrant hot pink and it looks amazingly cute when on.  Any time I bring her out with it on, at least 3 people stop me to ask where I got it.  It fits my 3 1/2 month old perfectly and I don't usually have a problem keeping it on her.  The only problem I had was when I ordered it, I wasn't sure which color I was going to get since there were a few different colors pictured and it didn't specify, but as mentioned before I got the hot pink one and loved it.  I added some pictures so you can see how adorable it is!",5,1

"Piccolo Bambino Cotton Velour 5 Piece Gift Set, Blue","This blanket is so soft even after washing! Also, it is larger than other baby receiving blankets which makes it perfect for swaddling. I'm not a huge fan of the booties, they tie up but the strings are so small so I haven't used them. However, I have used the mittens on my newborn since I brought him home and they work really well although he is able to take them off on his own even though he is a newborn so maybe they are not as well fitting as I would have liked. The doggy is a cute addition to this set as a security blanket.",5,1
Storksak Jess - Natural,"I LOVE this bag.  It is the PERFECT size. It doesn't look huge and bulky on the outside, but it IS huge on the inside!  It holds every thing I need for me and my kid & baby, plus some extra room for anything else I might want to throw in!  ...also water resistant inside and out.  This is the best bag I have ever bought and will use it till it falls apart.  And I get compliments on it all the time too :)**Update**  I have now had this bag for almost a year and I still love it, however, it is looking a little dingy and worn.  Also, the leather where the strap attaches in the top corners is starting to tear a little.  This is probably due to the fact that I take it EVERYWHERE we go, however, I still thought that this might be an important factor to consider in a decision if you are someone (like me) who keeps a purse/bag for years before replacing it.  The tearing is the specific reason why I took one star away.",4,1

Adds great color and design to the room, I would order again!",5,1
"Kolcraft Cozy Soft Portable Crib Mattress, Lily","this mattress is not a perfect fit for the graco pnp I own, but it will do.  I just fill the excess space with some rolled up blankets. my son is 8months and not in any danger of suffocating so its fine. its just the right amount of soft and firm.  My son doesn't sink in yet its soft enough to be comfortable.  my son gets a good nights rest and I do too so I'm happy.",4,1
"Kolcraft Cozy Soft Portable Crib Mattress, Lily","The Graco Pack n Play that I have comes with a very hard bottom. My son never wanted to sleep in it and would barely play in it for long. My theory was it had to be super uncomfortable, so I decided to buy a mattress for it.Please be advised that this mattress is about 2 inches too narrow to fit the PnP perfectly.Now that the mattress is in the PnP my son plays and naps in there. The only reason I am giving this mattress 4 stars instead of 5 is because it smelled so badly of chemicals that we had to air it out for 2 days before we used it.",4,1

"Angel Dear Pair and a Spare 3 Piece Blanket Set, Frog","My sister-in-law received these as a gift from one of our friends and when I asked her what items were the most helpful as a new mom, she said these were at the top of her list. She said that they were just the right size and so soft that she used them constantly.  I have since used them with my nephew and I totally agree. I purchased this set as a gift for one of my friends and I think these sets will now be my &#34;go-to&#34; shower gift.  They come in so many cute colors and versions and the packaging is adorable and perfect for gift giving.  They're great for burping cloths or as a little blanket.",5,1
Snoogle Chic Jersey - Snoogle Replacement Cover with Zipper for Easy Use - Heather Gray,I love this cover!  Fits perfectly and was actually fairly easy to cover the Snoogle with.  I was worried since the Snoogle is such a weird shape but it worked great.,5,1
Snoogle Chic Total Body Pillow,"I have had this pillow for months now, so I feel I can give an informed review.  It took about a week to get used to sleeping with it and to break in the part where my head goes, but since then I have been more than happy with it -- in fact, I had my baby over a month ago and I still use it and find it incredibly comfortable.  The best part while I was pregnant was that I slept more soundly with the pillow so I didn't wake up to go to the bathroom as many times during the night, so I actually felt well-rested in the morning.  The best part now that the baby is born is that I can fold it in half in the middle of the night when the baby wakes up and it becomes a backrest for nursing - very comfortable and much better than just leaning against a regular pillow because it has ""arms"" for more support.  One thing though:  the jersey knit cover is very comfortable and fits the pillow perfectly, but the regular cotton cover is not soft at all and it doesn't fit properly around that curved area at the top so it ends up digging into your neck/shoulder area.  Stick with the jersey cover.",5,1
Jeep Jogging Stroller Weather Shield,Fits my Baby Trend expedition jogger perfectly. Keeps wind off baby and helps him get his nap! Has a little pocket to put phone or snacks etc. I hope to use the stroller through at least December with this weather shield.,5,1
Character Inflatable Potty Seat (Blue),I bought this for a cruise we took as out little guy needed something to use on the ship.

"Nuby 2 Count Super Spout Easy Gripper, Colors May Vary, 10 Ounce","My son loved this cup when he was using it instead of a bottle so I was excited to find them here after looking at the local stores. They fit in my bottle warmer too because of their simple design.  I was suprised to see complaints because they were perfect in my eyes.  Then I bought these and one was a leaker.  Not just a drop or a trickle but a full on river of milk leaking out of the top.  II tried everything.  Tightening the top; loosening the top; trying the top with another bottom; removing the spout and placing it back in (even though the leak was coming from where the top and bottom meet).  So, if you decide to buy these, they are really great if they work and they are totally useless if they don't. Apparently, from all of the other reviews, it is a roll of the dice.",4,1
KinArt Diaper Bags D'Lite Carrier Bag (Grey),Surpringly roomy with lots of extra pockets! And so beyong pleased it's not garish. Simple and perfect for our needs. :),5,1
"J.L. Childress 6 Bottle Cooler Tote Bag, Blue/Green","I own one other cooler by this maker and it worked great for my first daughter, who would usually drink four bottles at daycare. I needed a slightly larger cooler for my second daughter, for whom I need to pack five or six bottles for daycare. This is the perfect size for my needs.",5,1

Butterfly Mobile,"This mobile is beautiful.  There were no reviews when I bought it so I thought I'd create one.  The colors are great and the size is perfect.  You do have to hang it from the ceiling some how, but that's not an issue for me.  I prefer not to hang anything from a crib anyway, so this was perfect for me.  It's amazing and beautiful and everything I wanted.  I would definitely buy it again.",5,1

"The First Years Compass Pathway B570 Adjustable Booster Seat, Black and Khaki",I purchased this carseat after purchasing a Graco Turbobooster for my daughter to use in our other car.  THe Graco booster works fine in our van but it was very difficult for her to buckle in our Honda Civic so I was looking for something different for that car.  I chose this based on the recommendations and I have been very impressed so far (we have had it about a month now).  Having arms that rise up is a really nice feature (something the Graco does not do).  The guides (which are adjustable) for the seatbelt also put the belt in a much better position than the Graco seat (and my daughter is already 6 so I think for a younger child this would be a much better seat).  The seat itself is ready to go as soon as you take it out of the box (unlike the Graco which we had to attach the arms).  I also think the removable drink holders will be very nice for cleaning although we haven't had to do that yet.  The side head rests at the top are also very comfortable.  I am very happy with this seat and when I compare it side by side to our Graco it wins every category hands down except for the fabric which my daughter prefers her pink/purple colors of the Graco.  I personally don't choose a seat based on appearance so I am fine with that but if I had a choice in fabrics I would have chosen something different if it was available.  I am very picky on the safety of my carseats which is why I didn't let my daughter even get a booster until age 6 (had her in a Britax Marathon until then).  As for safety I really feel this seat is far superior to the Graco Turbobooster b/c of the way the lap and shoulder belts fit perfectly where it should.,5,1
Giant Peel &amp; Stick Nursery Decal - Forest Animals &amp; Flowers Tree for Boys &amp; Girls (Tree Assembles 4.7 Feet Tall),It looks amazing in my daughters room. The size and colors are perfect and you can adapt it to the space you have. I will recommend this product.,5,1

Under the Sea Tropical Fish Nursery/Kids Room Wall Art Sticker Decals,"I bought these to brighten up my kids' bathroom a bit, and they are perfect. The images are really bright and fun, without being too childish. They were really easy to apply, just peel and stick. Easy to reposition when I messed up. They felt fairly sturdy when I was peeling them off the sheet, if you are gentle they won't tear. I put them on the outside of the shower glass, so they shouldn't get too wet. Hopefully they will stand up to bathroom humidity, because they look great.",5,1
"Momo Baby Travel Bowl and Spoon Set, Green","Spoon, bowl, lid! All in the same place! What more can I ask for? Perfect for our busy schedule and my big eater.",5,1
"Momo Baby Skid-proof Silicone Placemat, Green","I love this placemat I searched for a long time and ordered and returned many items to find a placemat that works for me. Our table is not smooth so suction cups dont work and I needed something that does not leave a residue. This is perfect for my son as he grows. Sticks to my non smooth table (and smooth one downstairs), does not leave a residue at all, Also allows items on top to stick to it but they are easily moved by my son (like his cup), so far easy to wash but I have only rinsed it and it stayed tacky. No washing instructions included. Emailed the company and it said they believe it is dishwasher safe. That does not make me confident, and is my only complaint. I have not used a red pasta on it yet so I do not know if it will stain. However if it does it will not bother me. I would so reccommend this to everyone. Would not travel well because of the tackiness, maybe it could be packed in a wax paper and brought along, that might work.",4,1
Aden and Anais - Hooded Towel and Washcloth - Water Baby,"After 3 washes, this product is the softest terry cloth bath towel for a newborn. The muslin wash cloths are heavy weight and perfect for keeping baby warm while in the bath.",5,1
Aden &amp; Anais Muslin Dream Blanket Little Man Baby Blanket,"My little boy loved this blanket from the first time he cuddled it. We got it when he was about 10 months old and he's now 15 months old and it's in great condition still. This blanket is the perfect size for our growing toddler because it's so big! If you want a blanket that your baby can use from infant to child, this is it. Not only that, but it's breathable so there haven't been too big of worries for this mommy! He drags it around the whole house and loves to rub his face into it because it's so soft. After all the use, I'm happily surprised that it's still so soft and that it still looks so nice. Totally recommend.",5,1
"Angelcare Baby Sound Monitor, White","Needed a (relatively) cheap audio only monitor for the Mother-In Law's house.  This fit the bill perfectly.  You can adjust the sensitivity of the sensor base (the part that stays near the baby while they sleep).  Once the baby's cries are louder than your setting, then the speaker activates on the receiver.  Nice nightlight function.  I like that it also has a switch to turn off the &#34;out of range&#34; alert.  Belt clip is useful.Just as a notice though - there is a recall for the version of this that comes with the baby mattress pad movement monitor.",5,1
"Angelcare Baby Sound Monitor, White","It's been working perfectly for us. I was concerned that I would not hear the babys movements or moans and only be able to hear once he cries, but the sound is really Clear, I can hear when baby kicks or does low moans/sounds. I like the option of hearing babys room at all times. Monitor alerts you if the other component is turned off. I like the clip you can use when your moving around the house. Price was reasonable too. Very happy with the purchase.",5,1
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive","Love, love, LOVE these bags.  I bought the small snack bag, medium snack bags and the wet bag.  The designs are so cute and they are all really well made and durable.  The small bag is perfect for an on-the-go snack and the medium bag is the perfect size for a sandwhich.  I can't wait to use the wet bags over the summer when the kids are at the pool.",5,1
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive","I love these! I wanted to stop using and throwing away so many of those little plastic snack and sandwich bags, but didn't want to replace them with another plastic product.  I love the itzy ritzy bags.

"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive","My boyfriend got me these because I kept using so many plastic snack bags and he could not stand all the wasted plastic. These bags are excellent.  At first I was concerned the insides would get all dirty, but the material on the inside is really easy to clean.  I have had no problems with this product and am thrilled at how clean I can keep the bags.  I also love the small sizes they come in, perfect for a few crackers or strawberries.  I Highly recommend them.  I was using so many disposable sandwich bags for years, I am very happy to no longer be adding to a landfill.",5,1

"Real Nappies 6-Pack of Snug Wrap Diaper Covers, Toddler Size, for babies 18+ months, 29 lb to 40 lb","These were perfect for our new baby.  There are no gussets, so we didn't order the next size up (when baby gets more active).  We had a similar style for our oldest child in the M size and they leaked quite a bit -- when he would crawl, his clothing could get wedged into the diaper cover and the wetness would spread.  We only use covers with gussets now (Thirsties is our favorite brand -- or homemade!) for older age baby/toddler due to movement.  But for newborns, these are perfect, totally affordable, and very well made!  If they made a 6-pack with gussets for older babies I'd totally buy them!!!!  Keep me posted if they do!",5,1
"Real Nappies 6-Pack of Snug Wrap Diaper Covers, Toddler Size, for babies 18+ months, 29 lb to 40 lb","You absolutely cannot beat the current price on these (six bucks/apiece) for the quality of construction.Construction: Awesome economy wraps. Velcro seems industrial-strength, seams well-sewn, flap in interior to hold prefold, and nice laundry tabs. Fabric is thick, yet soft, certainly seems like it will maintain waterproof-ness for repeated washes. The company has a 2 child guarantee, meaning they will repair or replace your covers-- not sure how they enforce a time limit on this or ensure consumer honesty, but the guarantee made me fairly certain that if they fell apart at all within the next few months, I wouldn't have to trash them and could at least resell. Sadly, they DO NOT have leg gussets. I find that gussets are helpful for walkers, because they provide more freedom of movement, and if fitted properly, reduced odds of chafing at the legs. We have not yet experienced any, but I know that I am not alone in my preference for gussets. The 2.5"" flap inside is helpful for placing a prefold, but I have to say when you're dealing with a child this size (29+ lbs), the whole flap idea is much better in theory than practice. Please note they are not ""pocket diapers,"" which I absolutely never took to, but they just have a small ""placeholder"" for the diaper layer. They fit gDiaper disposable refills well.Sizing: These are indeed true-to-size. Which makes them a bit ""meh"" for us right now, as son is just barely 29 lbs-- they are a bit large-looking, but have yet to leak. He can also undo the velcro tabs by himself, but I don't blame the company for that-- that's the price you pay for h & l with a toddler (son is nearly 2).Now don't get me wrong, these are nice, plain, quality wraps for the price, BUT Thirsties wraps are thinner material and more flexible AND have leg gussets. They are also significantly more expensive, but I just mention them for comparison sake.It is also entirely possible that I am a bit spoiled by the Best Bottoms system I prefer-- I like that the inserts snap in and thus do not bunch up or roll out when trying to diaper a very active little one. They are easily double the price-- again, simply comparison for moms that may be debating between several choices. Overall, I am pleased with the price I paid for these covers and will continue to us them at home, at least for a while yet, or keep them as backups. If they had leg gussets, snaps for inserts (instead of prefold pocket) and snap-ins to match, and the choice of snaps v. velcro (kind of like ease of velcro, but more of a pain to launder and child removes them when he sees fit!), they would be a perfect five stars. Oh wait, did I just describe Best Bottoms? I recommend moms check those out too-- and no, I do not work for, nor was I paid, by that company, but maybe I should be. :)[...]",4,1
"Baby Deedee Sleep Nest Baby Sleeping Bag, Dream Blue, Small (0-6 Months)","I was looking for a warm sleepsack that would keep my son warm during the fall and winter months. This sack is perfect for midwest winters. My son loves this sleep sack and has worn it from 6 months to a year with no issues. It was a bit long on him in the beginning but he has grown into it nicely and we are now beginning to use a lighter weight one for summer.The quality is great, has help up through many washings, all stains from medicine have come out and the orange color has not faded a bit. We love this and will use again if we have another. We have had many other sleepsack and this is by far our favorite.",5,1
Sckoon Organic Cotton Natural Baby Plush Toy Doll Dog,"I love the vintage, handmade look of this little plush. It is made of organic cotton. It wash well, goes into the drier (even if it took a bit of time to dry) and came out of it perfect. To me, the perfect toy for baby.",5,1

"Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stroller, Blueberry",We love the joovy caboose ultralight stroller. We've had for about 3 months now. Normally gets used for carrying two kids in/out of daycare but has also been used for festivals and regular walks. It folds ups nicely and has a little latch to secure it. The car seat adapter was also really easy and way convenient when our second little guy was asleep in his car seat. Love the parent organizer as you can store lots of stuff in all the slots along with two drinks. The canopy is enough to cover both kids when older one is sitting down. The big thing for me was ease of use and it's weight and both are great. I can push with one hand perfectly fine when needed and opening up is super easy. Just unlock the latch and pull and it snaps right into place. The storage underneath is great but it is hard to access sometimes. Other than that it's a great stroller all around with two boys and we love it.,5,1
"Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stroller, Blueberry","Overall great stroller. Not comfortable for the kid in the back on long trips, so I wouldn't advise using this at Disneyland unless your kid rarely sits. Perfect for quick trips around town. Folds up easy, but its long. A little challenging to get to the underbasket since you have to squeeze past the little seat in back. Not a huge deal, but good to know. I'm using this with the car seat adapter (which is easy to place with a strap to secure) in front so I might have to come back another time to review how it works once my son can sit up front.",4,1
"Safety 1st Sounds n Lights Discovery Walker, Dino","After reading thru series of review I finally settled for two of  this walker for my 3 months twins (boy & girl). just got them this week, assembling them was quite easy.After assembling them they look so beautiful and like other reviewers has rightly pointed out, it was a bit high for my three months babies but I am perfectly ok with it bc at this age I just want them to sit there and  enjoy themselves not bothering abt walking and they are. Before they gets to six months their feet should be perfectly touching the ground.My kids are in love with their new walker.  my daughter wants to explore with the toys while my son just want to sit there and watch cartoon. For a three months old, my son is such an independent young man that act like a grown up.In all I am happy with my purchase and will recommend it any day.",5,1
Jeep Universal Cruiser Car Seat Carrier,"this is so much better than a fullsize stroller.  nice and light, fold easily, and much easier to move around.  the large bag on the bottom and the two side pouches also come in very handy.  stroller is plenty solid enough, and our eddie bauer car seat fits perfectly.  i would defintely recommend this frame to anyone that is lugging around a car seat!",5,1
Jeep Universal Cruiser Car Seat Carrier,"I was looking for a universal stroller base like this one because I use public transit and needed a light weight option. This fit the bill perfectly.

She was a little on the small size (6lbs 9oz) and this is perfect for supporting her tiny body. It's very womb-like and she'll snuggle in and sleep for hours at a time. This goes everywhere we do these days. In fact, I'm considering ordering another so we have one on both floors of our house. Can't recommend this product enough!",5,1
"Luvable Friends 6 Pack Baby Burp Cloths, Blue","Soft terry cloth in the perfect size. They go over my shoulder, on my lap or on my brest friend. Since there are 6, I have enough before I start the washer.",5,1
Playtex BPA FREE Baby Sipster Spill-Proof 6 OZ Cup - 2 Pack - girl colors,"These are the playtex cups you know and love, but a smaller size which is perfect for milk and/or to pack in smaller lunch pails.  I bought some of this size just for those reasons. They have all the other playtex features you love in the bigger cups, which means the valves are interchangeable. : )",5,1
Lamaze High-Contrast Panda Rattle,"At around 5 months my daughter finally started to take an interest in this panda toy, and now its one of her favorites.  It's very lightweight so doesn't do any damage when my daughter inevitably bangs it against her head, and it's size is perfect for her to get a good grip on.  My only nit is that the white part gets really dirty looking really fast (all the drool and baby slobber doesn't help).  Otherwise it's a great toy!",4,1
Lamaze Soft Chime Garden Musical Toy,"My neice may only be 3 months old, but this musical toy gets her attention and she smiles and laughs out!  It's perfect",5,1
Lamaze High-Contrast Flip-Flop Bug Rattle,"This was the first toy my son reached for and grabbed as an infant, and remains a favorite.  I think the colors are perfect for an infant and the size is, also.  So much so that whenever friends are expecting, I have to buy one of these for them as a gift!  It always goes over well!  I also bought a spare for us in case my son ever loses his.  Highly reccommended!",5,1

I can not be any happier..I have been looking for something like this for over a year! Thank you so much :)",5,1
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty",Great car seat. I drive an '03 Nissan Xterra and the seat fits perfectly. I read many reviews prior to this purchase and had a good idea what I was getting in to. The seat sits up high and allows for my 1 year old to see out the windows. I had to position the seat on the driver's side to keep it from blocking my view. Rear install took a little patience due to unclear instructions about feeding the latch system through the seat and the use of a pool noodle to make the seat level. I actually had to wrap a towel around the pool noodle to achieve a level seat. I had to tighten the latch system a few times in the first week to account for shifting and the seat seems to have settled in. It's been a few weeks and I would absolutely purchase this seat again.,5,1
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty","We purchased this carseat after doing extensive research.  We looked carefully at the Britax Advocate, the Radians and the Recaro Proride.  I am very happy with the Recaro.  Everything about it is high-quality.First - it is extremely solid, with excellent cushions around the head.  It installed very quickly with the rear-facing latch system in the middle of the backseat of our Prius.  It fits perfectly and still allows each front seat to recline and adjust fully forward and backwards.  The fabric is excellent and very high-quality (we got one in Blue Opal, and another in Envy), and my 7 month old daughter doesn't overheat in it like she did in our Chicco Keyfit carseat.  The cover is also easily removable for clean up (unlike the Radians).  She is happy when we put her into this seat, whereas she used to scream when we put her in her Chicco carseat.Also, several of the negative reviews state that this carseat is too narrow and won't be comfortable when the child is 4 or 5 years old.  We previously had purchased a Britax Advocate, and it was so wide that it was uncomfortable for an adult to sit in the backseat next to the baby.  The Recaro doesn't have that problem.  We will likely switch to a booster seat by the time the width becomes an issue, and the Recaro is so much more user-friendly now.  It also comes with WHALE stickers - which was a great suprise.  This is the ""We Have A Little Emergency"" program that indicates to emergency responders that identifying and contact information for the child is listed on a sticker hidden on the back of the seat (so that random passers-by don't have access to that information).  If you child is ever driven around by a nanny/grandmother/friend, and that person becomes unconscious from an accident, it gives you peace of mind to know that you will be contacted about your baby.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Compact Drying Station,"I wasn't going to buy a bottle drying station, but bought this on a whim. So glad I did. We have limited counter space, so it's perfect because I can put it away in a drawer when  it's not in use. And while it is in use, I can put it on a towel on the counter or I can place it on top of our normal dish rack. I use it to dry pump parts and bottles, and it holds everything quite well for me. Obviously this isn't the drying station for you if you have tons of space and don't want something that you have to put a towel under, but for what it's intended to do, it's a pretty darn brilliant design.",5,1
Prince Lionheart Deluxe Drying Station,I really like how easy it is to put together and the different teirs and sized hooks are perfect for my newborns bottle accessories and my pump accessories. It is made out of plastic so I'm hoping it will be durable but I've only had mine for a month and so far so good. It takes up a fair amount of counter space but honestly if the rack were any smaller I wouldn't have enough room after one day of bottles & pumping.,4,1
"Infantino Flip Front 2 Back Carrier, Black","Really, you can't beat this carrier for the price. I was deciding between this and splurging on something like the Ergo which is a lot more expensive. I really wasn't sure why there was such a price difference but I'm sure you get what you pay for with items like these. For my 4 month old baby this is perfect. He will fit in it for a while and it's comfortable for both of us. I am 5'2"" 120lbs and it fits great even with my small size and big baby!  I have a Moby wrap which is great but this is much more practical for things like trips to the zoo or a grocery store run.. especially once your baby can control their head. It's also much easier to get on and off. I would recommend this for sure!  If you're more interested in baby wearing more frequently and with a newborn, maybe splurge on the expensive brands but otherwise this will do the job.",5,1
Annabel Karmel Freeze Cube Tray,"It looks like these are mostly used to freeze home-made baby food, but that's really neglecting another fantastic use of them... making the perfect ice for boozy drinks!  Using fewer but larger ice cubes means less surface area, so less melted water in your drink.  The wife and I have also used these to freeze juice to use as ice cubes for an incredibly boozy, light-your-own-hair-on-fire tiki drinks.  I'm sure there are also a myriad of other adult beverage uses that we haven't thought of.It's pretty easy to clean and the ice is also more easily retrieved out of than a different cube tray we had and got frustrated with.  If you get a stubborn one, just grab a butter knife and loosen up the four side, then push from the bottom.",5,1
"Infantino Explore and Store Gym, Jungle Buddy","Perfect, small size that works great for travel. My baby girl likes playing with it. We give it two thumbs up!",5,1
"Munchkin Stroller Netting, White","This fits perfect over the BOB with the infant carseat adapter and carseat in place.  It keeps the bugs off my little one while we are outside and I was skeptical about the UV protection, but my baby hasn't gotten burned (not like I leave him sitting in the sun or anything).  It's hard to keep the sun off of him at all times so this just gives a little added protection.  I'm really glad I bought this.",5,1
"Planet Wise Travel Wet/Dry Diaper Bag, Outer Space","I got braces last year, and this item is perfect to hold all my teeth brushing and cleaning supplies, very useful and keeps things tidy!!",5,1
"Planet Wise Travel Wet/Dry Diaper Bag, Outer Space","Design is beautiful -  Just as seen in picture.Perfect for washable cotton pads, but I am only able to fit about 3 large pads or 4 small pads in the large pocket at a time.The lining is not completely waterproof, and is not suitable for very wet materials.However, I am satisfied with this product and would recommend it to ladies who are using re-usable cotton pads.",5,1
Eddie Bauer Broadmoor Diaper Bag,I bought this bag for my son who is now 15 months. It's perfect for downsizing a diaper bag. We no longer need to pack bottles etc so this has been working great for us. Worth the purchase!,5,1
Disney Baby- A Bear Named Pooh Lamp by Kidsline,"This fits perfectly on our bookshelf. It's a great light and the beutral color looks good with the classic pooh bedding. I wish we hadn't bought the other lamp as this one is much nicer, but now we have 2.",5,1
Maclaren 2010 Volo Stroller Silver Green Stripe,"Ordered this and have been using it for a few days. It's pretty, light-weight, easy to fold, everything is just perfect. My 3 years old son just loves it. We will use it for a long trip soon, hope the quality won't disappoint us either.",5,1
Safety 1st 2 Pack Custom Fit All Purpose Strap,"These are perfect for drawers in our bathroom.  Our toddler was opening drawers with bathroom supplies and this worked as a quick fix.  She can't open the drawers anymore.  Plus, it's easy to install you just use the two stickers and you are done.  It's also easy to open.  We didn't want to drill holes into our cabinets so this worked as a great quick fix.  I'd suggest for anyone that needs something fast and easy.",5,1
Safety 1st 2 Pack Custom Fit All Purpose Strap,"I wish i would have started with these straps! Originally i bought the &#34;bike lock&#34; looking locks for my cupboards.  The work great but after i got these Multi purpose straps i wished i had started out with them instead.Super easy to install and i use them on everything!!!  Beside cupboards, i have round stainless steel trash can - strap works great.  Toliet seat cover, perfect.  The best use of all is the LAZY-SUSAN cupboard! what a dream, easy to get in and out of for us.Overall i would recommend starting with these rather than any other baby proof lock.",5,1
"RECARO ProBOOSTER High Back Booster Car Seat, Riley","I really like this booster.  I spent a long time researching which one to buy, and finally chose this one.  First off, I should explain that it was bought for my 7-year-old daughter who is very tall and broad shouldered for her age.  She is well past the post that she is required by law to be in a booster, but I want her to stay in one because she has a very hard time sitting correctly in the car without a booster. For a larger child, this seat is perfect.  She is on the second to top head support slot, which I was amazed by.  As a comparison, she is too tall for the older Recaro booster seat (the Vivo) as well as the other Boosters with backs that we have tried.  She loves how comfortable the seat is.  Also, it is a very sturdy feeling seat, not flimsy at all.  We have had the seat in a Ford Expedition, Honda Accord, Cadillac Deville, Ford F-150 and Honda Pilot; in all of these we did not have the tipping problem some people talk about.  I really love this seat and would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid booster.",5,1
Dapper Snapper Baby &amp; Toddler Adjustable Belt ~ Navy,This belt is awesome!! My 3 year son can use the restroom without me having to bother with unhooking his belt! He also likes to go to the restroom by himself and with this belt he can! It is perfect!,5,1
Dapper Snapper Toddler Belt BLACK,"This has been perfect for my son who is slender.  He has special needs and sometimes a belt was to difficult for him to undo.  Now with this, his pants stay up and he is able to take down his pants on his own.",5,1
Jeep Baby View Mirror,"Jeep Baby View MirrorIts a firm mirror, perfect size, can be adjusted with two buttons on the sides, making the mirror narrow or wider.I can see my 2 years old little girl perfectly all the time.",5,1
Motorola MBP15 Baby Monitor With backlit LCD,"My oldest is 12 and we have been through more baby monitors than I want to count.  This one is just about perfect.  It's silent unless the baby makes noise.  Love the temp monitor and night light.  The music feature is lost on us.  Our girls are toddlers and they'd just get up and mess with it but it was fun to be able to use the 2 way communication to turn it off and tell them to go back to bed.  LOLI say just about perfect because I wish the receiver battery held a longer charge.  It's only good for a few hours so I don't trust it overnight unless its on the charger.  It will beep as it's dying.  I really wanted a good battery operated transmitter for those nights when the power goes out. This is the only monitor I could find that had a battery operated transmitter as well as receiver.  I've only had one chance to test this and it worked ok but I'm not sure how long it would last. Also if you don't have your receiver fully charged when you lose power you're screwed because it only works off it's internal battery. If the transmitter battery gets low IT starts beeping which wakes the baby up.  Bad design on that but otherwise the best monitor I've ever had.Pros -Silent, no feedbackNursery temp display2 way communicationBoth units can be battery operatedCons -Limited volume adjustment.  Lowest setting is sometimes too loud for meChild can turn on music optionsShort battery lifeTip - I have 2 of these in separate bedrooms and was worried about interference.  The monitors automatically pair to the receiver but you can have 2 working next to each other.  They stay paired and work fine.",5,1
Sassy On-the-Go Feeding Set - Colors May Vary,"I bought this for myself, after having weight loss surgery; I needed something that would hold smaller portion sizes. This works perfectly. You have to be careful if you use anything that is really ""juicy"" as the smaller lids don't seal perfectly. I put grapefruit in juice in one and it leaked out of the smaller container into the main compartment, but because everything was in its own little covered container nothing got wet. Great substitute for a bento box!",5,1
PottyCover - Disposable toilet seat covers. (6 individually packaged seat covers in each bag.),"With five children, travel used to be difficult when it came time for bathroom breaks. PottyCovers have changed all that. We no longer have any issues finding a place for the kids (and us) to go. PottyCovers remove the anxiety from dealing with less than perfect public bathrooms. They are extremely well designed and produced. We have never had a problem with them. They have a permanent place in our glove boxes and my wife's purse.",5,1
PottyCover - Disposable toilet seat covers. (6 individually packaged seat covers in each bag.),"I checked the reviews on this product to see if this was what I was looking for. It is so hard to cover the toilet seat in public places. I read the negative reviews, but decided to try this one. I works perfectly!!!! It covers the entire seat. I had no problem with it sliding off. Now I don't have to worry about dirty toilet seats when we go out in public. I don't have to worry about kids touching side of toilet. Every part of toilet is covered. Great product Amazon!!!",5,1

"Maclaren Volo Stroller, Black","My husband teases me about my passion for having a GOOD stroller. He calls me the Stroller Hoarder. My son is not quite 2 and we have had 5 strollers (not all at once though!), so I am experienced in comparing them and know what features I like in one.Many advice articles on the internet said to avoid ""big bulky travel systems"" so that is what we did when I was pregnant and we had to select one. Later on, of course, I was GIVEN an older Graco Quattro Tour and practically wept with how much I loved it. This is the most importnat lesson in finding a stroller that will work for you: look at YOUR LIFESTYLE and what YOU do with strollers, not what bloggers in NYC want in a stroller. I live in the suburbs, occasionally shop at malls, and travel to mostly kid-friendly destinations these days, so a ""big travel system"" stroller worked great for us.Alas, the time came when my super-tall son outgrew it. Just couldn't fit his little knees in there anymore. So it was time to retire it to Consignment Store Heaven.Then I set about on the search for the perfect lightweight umbrella stroller. I have some friends who had raved about their Maclarens, but I also knew how much the urban bloggers love them, so was a little leery. However, after doing research, it basically came down to the Volo or a $15 Walmart special, with no features at all.I decided on the Volo, for it's tall handlebars (my husband is very tall), mesh basket (which is tiny, but better than nothing), and the decent sunshade on it. I would advise anyone to shop around for a good deal. I got mine on eBay for $49 shipped, brand new in box as they were clearing out the prior year's stock.As for the stroller itself? I really like it! Of course, within a week of owning it, I found out we are expecting a second child... figures, right?What I Like:-The tall, padded handles. Very comfortable for pushing!-The easy one handed fold down-How compactly it folds. I drive a Jetta, and it's great to have most of my trunk space back again!-Super light weight!!! I haven't had to fly anywhere since we got it, but it will be much less of an ordeal than bringing the Graco, I'm sure.-Great sunshade, that is detachable if you want.-Mine came with a raincover, which is awesome! I've used it only once in Oregon so far this winter, and it did a good job.-Brakes & wheels that you can lock or let swivel-5 point harness that my kid can NOT unbuckle himself (...yet)What I Don't Like:-The storage basket is SUPER SMALL. But, for this size/weight of strollers, it's rare to find a basket period.-It tips over REALLY easily if my son is out of it because it is so lightweight.-The fabric shows dirt really easily (mine is white and blue)... I haven't tried to wash it yet or anything, but it will need a washing soon. I have never had to actually machine wash any of my other strollers ever.-Definitely NOT for use on anything other than a smooth surface. Don't even try to take this on a bumpy sidewalk.-I have the available cup holder/mesh accessory bag made by Maclaren. The cupholders are unusable for adult sized drinks, and it is hard to get in and out of the mesh bag.All in all, this is a fantastic toddler stroller. I wouldn't use it with a smaller baby, or for my MAIN baby stroller. But my son is big enough now that we don't use strollers quite as often... and when we do, I enjoy using this one. It meets our needs perfectly and matches up with our lifestyle well. It is also stylish and cute, which is a plus!I just don't know what to do now that we are expanding our family. I am a big stroller user (some people aren't - these people always remind me of Maggie Gyllenhall in Away We Go, hahaha), so will be getting a double for at least the first year. I am not sure if I will sell this one (for a possible profit even!) or keep it around since it was so cheap and it takes up so little room. Might come in handy when I have a 3 or 4 year old and a smaller baby, right? Haha. You can never have enough strollers!",4,1
"Maclaren Easy Traveller Car Seat Carrier, Silver/Black","I use this with my Chicco Keyfit 30. It came with an adapter bar that is supposed to help the Chicco sit correctly. However, I think that the bar makes the carseat slant too far forward - the line on the carseat that is supposed to be level with the ground while the carseat is in the car is not level. It's not tilted enough to make me worry, though.My main issue with using this stroller is that the safety strap is extremely difficult to adjust, and I still don't have it quite as tight as I would like because the labels sewn to the strap prevent me from feeding the strap through the connector any further. It's secure enough, but I don't understand why they made it so difficult to tighten.Another issue - it's a bit hard to access the storage once the carseat is on the stroller. I find that it's easier to access it from the front. There is so much space in the basket, though, that I can overlook this. The size of the storage basket was a major reason I chose this over other brands.Overall, I really like this stroller. I compared it to other brands, and found that it pushes more smoothly and I like that it folds more compactly than others. At least one of the other brands just folds flat, while the Maclaren folds like an umbrella stroller. This makes it much easier for me to put it in my car - I can easily put it in the backseat if the trunk is full. It's also light - I could pick it up with no worries after my c-section.It's not perfect, and if I had known Chicco was going to come out with one especially for the Chicco Keyfit I would have waited, but the Maclaren meets my needs well enough and is well-made.",4,1
Sassy Less Mess Toddler Self-Feeding Spoon BLUE,My daughter is so eager to try and feed herself and none of the spoons we had were working well at all.  These spoons are great and have defintely helped her to get more food in her mouth.  The angle is perfect!,5,1
"Baby Trend Sit N Stand Double Stroller, Elixer","This is the second time we've purchased two of these (the first two were damaged in a car accident)and really like them. I don't think anything is different at all but the color.Pros:They are well-built and quite strong, and work well for infants who can hold their heads up/sit up on their own, all the way to bigger preschoolers.They turn and handle well, and easy to open with a quick slide of the button while gripping the handle.We can easily fit both into our minivan by stacking them on their sides, then one on top of the other. They fold very nicely, and there is still plenty of space for groceries!Hint: I've found the easiest way to get them in and out of the trunk is to have it on it's side with the handlebar on the left and wheels on the right. Grabbing the handle with the left hand and the frame with the right, it has a nice weight distribution and seems to help ease the strain of lifting such a heavy/bulky item.We've logged hundreds of miles on our older ones, and expect as many on these. (I'm sure they had many more left in them, but they were badly damaged in the accident and we didn't want to put the kids at risk.) They're perfect for even Disneyland or the zoo since the wheels don't lock up.Cons:The baskets are not convenient at all because they are totally open at the back so things might slip out. Also, the footrest for the rear child blocks the top access to the basket so it's difficult to get things in and out.I will say that these new ones are more difficult to close- we almost have to twist the plastic piece with the slit onto the metal knob to get them to come together. Not easy with a bad back or arthritis...For the rear seat sit and stand feature, the seat had to be removed entirely, so there is no back rest for them to lean on. There's simply a strap. If they wanted, they could lean against the back of the front chair, but that would make them hunch over and be even more uncomfortable.Overall, we really like these strollers and were more than happy to buy the same thing again when we needed to. If you can live with the basket issue and (common for all these types)sit and stand issue, I'm sure you'll be happy with these.",4,1
"Sassy First Solids Feeding Bowl with Spoon, Boy, Blue","We ordered this bowl to use for introducing our baby to solids. We introduced her to cereal at 5 months and both my husband and I love this bowl and spoon.The bowl is pink and has a purple lid and comes with an orange soft spoon. I have used the bowl with this spoon and with the munchkin spoons and i prefer to use the Sassy spoon because is softer, and it has this wedges that makes it easy to rest on top of the bowl. When i tried using the munchkin spoon, i was not able to rest the spoon in the bowl as it would just flap and fall.We love the ergonomic design, and the fact that we are able to hold the bowl nicely in our palm, rest the soft spoon and use our free hand.The size of the bowl is perfect for starting on solids, since in the beginning she only ate half a teaspoon and then a teaspoon, other bowls would have been too big.I wanted to know if i could travel with this bowl, so i tested it, placed water inside it and place the lid, and moved it around, no leaking! perfect for the go! I have not had a problem with the lid either, fits perfectly.All in all i would totally recommend!",5,1
"Itzy Ritzy Travel Happens Sealed Wet Bag, Avocado Damask","I really like this wet bag. It's the perfect size for a diaper bag. I have a couple other wet bags but I like this one the best because its very sturdy and thick so I don't have to worry about it leaking. You can use it for cloth diapers or even a wet swim suit, etc. I would definitely recommend this product!",5,1
Aden + Anais Issie Security Blanket Set Declan Elephants,"Love, love, love these...so much that I'm buying a second set.  Yes, they are small and thin.  They are made out of 100% breathable muslin and I feel my baby is completely safe using this to sleep with without the fear of SIDS and suffocation.  You can't give a poor rating because YOU didn't read the description!  It clearly indicates that they are 16"" x 16"" and that it is open-weave.  They are the perfect size for baby/toddler to clutch during sleep or taking along in the car, carrying around, etc.  My son loves the satin edges to chew on or just to put in his mouth.  They wash beautifully and I've washed them many times and have never had any issues with fraying or the material falling apart.  Another quality product from Aden & Anais!!  If you want a large ""blanket"" for the purpose of keeping a baby warm; first, read the description and then search for a blanket!",5,1
Magic Bumpers Portable Child Safety Bed Guard Rail 48 Inch - Set of Two,We bought this for our 2 year old over active sleeper because we had to convert her crib into a toddler bed for potty training.  She LOVES her crib and would squish up against differnt corners or sides of the crib throughout the night. Our bed has the toddler rail but it leaves an entry/exit gap as well as it not being high or long enough for the bumper.  The magic bumper is perfect for the toddler bed.  It's like having a bumper against the toddler rail that goes past the rail to the full extent of the crib.  My daughter can easily get in and out of bed over the magic bumper and seems to enjoy squishing up against it at night.Granted it's just a foam wedge but it works really well and keeps the bed looking nice and neat.  I also love that it tucks under the fitted sheet so it doesn't get in the way of the decor.  I do wish it came with a storage bag but so far the bag it shipped in seems to do the trick. :),5,1
"Ju-Ju-Be Mighty Be Earth Leather Diaper Bag, Black/Hot Pink","I love this bag so much, I bought FOUR! Although, it will not fit the bill as a stand alone diaper bag for my needs (toddler and newborn) I use it as a COMPANION to my Ju-Ju-Be BFF! I had looked into the BePrepared (one big bag for my needs) but I found it way too heavy when loaded, and since for the most part my BFF could handle the basics for short trips, I needed a way to carry the extras on the long days/trips.This bag is VERY stuffable! Here is what I typcially carry in the Mighty Be (to give you an example of what fits at one time): 2 extra drinks (sippie rocket and a large soda bottle for me) in the 2 long outer pockets, 3 sweatshirts (for me and 2 kids), my DSLR (which I put inside a fuel cell for protection), and a Be Quick stuffed with snacks, and a Doodleboard and coloring books/crayons in the back/outside pocket, along with my super large appointment book. That list might not sound long, but those are awkward and bulky items and this is the only bag that I found which fits them perfectly! There are also two smallish zippered pockets inside, which are great for securing small loose items (lipstick, iphone, cash, etc).If you are diaper bag shopping I highly suggest you check out this combo: BFF + Mighty Be = Match made in heaven!Regarding the Earth Leather: I read a review that suggested the black Earth Leather was ""like a black hefty bag with handles..."", I will admit that scared me, but I am so glad I decided to try it for myself!! I love BOTH the brown and black leathers (that is 2 of my 4 Mighty Be bags). They look and feel very nice, much like an expensive (and real) leather coat my husband has (although earth leather is not real leather)! I think I prefer my EL Mighty Be bags over the fabric ones (because they look and feel so nice) HOWEVER, I love my fabric prints ones too! All of the MightyBes are light as air (when empty) which is nice that there is no extra weight added by the bag when full! The EL ones don't fold quite as flat when empty (well I don't want to try) and that is one advantage of having the fabric ones- I can fold them super small (they can fit into a Be Quick). I usually keep an empty one in the car, it is perfect to gather and throw all of the loose things in quickly when we get home!I highly recommed getting at least one of these to try for yourself, I think you will be surprised how much you can stuff inside! This would make a great gym bag too!",5,1
Dr. Brown's 2 Pack Natural Flow Level 3 Standard Nipple,I didn't realize that my baby was probably struggling a bit to get milk out of the #2 nipples we were using. These worked perfect and the price was right on Amazon. I had to order these with another product on Amazon however because they are so cheap.,5,1
Dr. Brown's 2 Pack Natural Flow Level 2 Standard Nipple,"I use about a tbsp of rice cereal to 4 oz of formula.  After experimenting, these are the perfect flow.  I also breastfeed, so didn't want the flow to be too fast, but the cereal wouldn't go through the level 1 nipple.",5,1
Dr. Brown's 2 Pack Natural Flow Level 2 Standard Nipple,My son got upset when eating. After we changed him to level 2 nipples he's back to eating like a champ. These are perfect starting at 3 months until 5 months or so. Then we had to up the levels again.,5,1
Kidalog Baby Food Mill Grinder,"Very nice mill!  Perfect for restaurants or visiting relatives!  I make the majority of our baby food in a Magic Bullet, but will probably use this more when our son starts eating meals with the family.",5,1
Kidalog Baby Food Mill Grinder,"Love this food mill. We use it for the pureed food needed for a G-tube diet.  It would also be perfect for baby food.We have also used the Cuisinart mini chopper, the small size stainless old-fashioned food mill, the Magic Bullet, and the Munchkin food mill.My assessments:1. Cuisinart mini chopper: great for bigger tasks and for pureeing larger amounts to a smooth consistency2. Small Stainless old-fashioned food mill: does a great job, but too much food loss and trouble for small servings3. Magic Bullet: does not do small (1/4-1/2 cup) servings well.  Things get stuck to the sides and it doesn't puree them4. Munchkin food mill: lighter-weight than the Kidalog, blade pops out more easily ending up in a big mess, blades don't grind things like chicken and fish well.  The Kidalog grinds a variety of foods more easily.The Kidalog is the best when comparing the Munchkin to the Kidalog food mills because:The Kidalog is sturdier, has a wider more stable base; it does not leak; the center grinding disk stays in place well while grinding (Only turn crank Clockwise, as with the Munchkin, if you turn the crank the other direction, the grinding disk will be released ending up in a mess); he blade works better than the Munchkin ( I can't figure out why, but it works better); the Kidalog has a clear cover than can be placed on top as you grind which is usefulfor things that might squirt like blueberries.Easy to clean, no spots where food gets stuck.Suggestions:Gently press down on the base while you grind, allowing the blades to do the work especially on meats or items that are tougher. (This was a good suggestion from another reviewer).  Just stick to cranking Clockwise and all will work well.Takes a few more days to receive from Canada, but it is worth the wait!  I was impatient and bought the Munchkin first.",5,1
Boon Flair Harness/Buckle,It was a very hard item to find elsewhere and it was exactly what I wanted and fitted perfectly and securely.,5,1
"Binkibear The Original Pacifier, Classic Brown","This was one of the best purchases I have made as a new mom. The Binkibear is the perfect size for my little man to hold.The bear is perfect way for him to find the binki on his own without me having to get up and give it to him at night or during the day.When we are out and about so many people are fascinated by the bear asking where I have gotten it and said they are going to recommend it to other moms they know.The only downsize was the size of the binki, little man loves the oval binki and the one that came with the bear has a palet shape and is smaller than what he was used to. Fortunately I had a binki with a handle of the shape he likes.",4,1
"Binkibear The Original Pacifier, Classic Brown","Perfect solution to finding a pacifier in the middle of the night.  I started putting it into the crib with my then 8 month old.  He didn't really pick up that it had a pacifier on it for a good 2 weeks or so.  Now it stays in the crib and when he wakes in the night for his paci, he knows to grab the bear.  Perfect solution.",5,1
Bright Starts Peek-A-Zoom Toy,"I bought this toy for my 10 month old daughter and she loves it.  It is perfect for her age.  She can easily ""pop"" open the characters out of the top of the airplane by manipulating the knobs.  One of them you smack down, the other is a knob you push, and the other is a key like shape that you twist.  All of these result in the characters popping up out of the top of the plane.  It is sort of like a jack in the box, but much easier for her to manipulate than the other pop up toys.  She also loves to push it around on the floor  and hear its take off sound.  It has a real life sound of an airplane taking off which my daughter loves to hear.  This toy has alot of features of similar toys but using them on an airplane is totally unique and my daughter loves to play with this toy.  I would highly recommend it.",5,1
"Baby Einstein Press and Play Pal Toy, Neptune","My 2 month old daughter loves the sounds it makes, keeps her quiet while I change her. Perfect size to attach to car seat or stroller.",5,1
"Baby Einstein Press and Play Pal Toy, Neptune",My daughter loved to play with this toy after she started to crawl. The toy was much smaller than I thought it would be but perfect for babies and the music almost made me jump out of my chair the first time she squeezed the paw lol!,4,1
"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue",I bought one of these gently used and my son has loved it ever since! He is now 7 months old and loves to jump jump jump. It's a perfect toy to entertain a young one. You can use rings and attach many other toys as well. I highly recommend.,5,1
"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue",The four different play stations helps with both coarse and fine motor skills and keeps my grandson interested.  He loves to bounce so this toy is perfect for him.,5,1
One Step Ahead The Big Gripper Slip Proof Bath Mat,i have 2 kids (16 MO AND 2.5 YR) this mat is perfect for the 2 of them in the tub.  we let it dry after each bath and then roll it up. have not yet machine washed it.,5,1
"Dream On Me / Mia Moda Playgio Play Yard, Red",It is exactly like they said. I love it! I am currently using it for a batch of puppies and it is perfect for them. The webbing is strong and they are extremely happy in it all day. It washes up nicely and is easy to keep clean. They are happy and comfortable and mom can get in and out via a chair next to it. I am going to clean it up really good when the pups are gone and use it for my newest grandsons when they visit! Great product and got here fast!!! And I needed it fast!!!,5,1
"GEENNY Boutique Crib Bedding Set, Sea Turtle, 13 Piece",I love the Boutique Sea Turtle crib bedding set.  It's perfect for the theme for the baby's room.  It's exactly what we were looking for!  It is well made and I love how everything looks.,5,1
GEENNY Wall Border For Boutique Teddy Bear 13 PCS Crib Bedding Set,"The borders were great and added just the right finishing touch to the baby's room.However, we had to use wallpaper paste to ensure that the border stayed up.  The glueon the back of the paper did not hold. Using the paste did create more work!It was; however, the perfect match for the 13 piece bedding set.  It would also be helpfulif the colors are mentioned in the descriptions.",4,1
"Little Toader Teething Toys, Chompin Chicken Wing",I bought this because it was hilarious. I'm reviewing it because it is an AWESOME toy. My daughter LOVES it. It is the perfect size for her little hands and she chews on it every which way she can. Bonus fun: the first picture we sent of her and her new wing freaked Grandma out. She hasn't yet choked on it and we take it everywhere. We also have a Sophie that she reaches for but Dad likes this because it doesn't squeak. Double bonus fun: since it is solid and has no hole for the squeaker it can go in the dishwasher. We gave our son's Sophie asthma a couple years ago by dishwashing it.,5,1

Jeep Standard Stroller Weather Shield,"I purchased 2 of the Jeep Standard Stroller Weather Shields for a recent trip to Europe during the &#34;rainy season.&#34;  They worked like a charm, my children did not get wet and the protective plastic guarded them perfectly against the elements.

Hand Held Scalp Head Massager - Set of Three ( Colors May Vary ),"Bought one of these for each member of my family. People love these things! It feels really good on your head. Some people even leave it on their heads just for the grip, which is very entertaining to see! They do seem a littl flimsy but what do you expect for a few bucks. No need for anything fancy when it comes to a head scratcher that's gonna sit on the dreaser most of the time after the novelty wears off. perfect inexpensive stocking stuffer. I even kept one for myself :)",4,1
Baby Jogger City Select Stroller with 2nd Seat Ruby,"After reading and watching countless stroller reviews, we settled on the Baby Jogger City Select (BJCS).  We have 2 boys, 4 months apart, so we needed essentially a stroller for twins.  For comparison's sake, we've been using a 7 year old Bugaboo Frog and a Graco snap n go.  Of the strollers we considered, only the UppaBaby and the Britax B-Ready were available in town to test.  The Phil & Ted's explorer and BJCS were unavailable even though we live in PDX and you would think this city is big enough.  We settled right off the bat on an in-line tandem.  Side by sides are just too obnoxious.  If you're on the road in a quiet neighborhood or out in the open, it's fine.  But if you're on a sidewalk or a path, you force everyone to get out of your way.Minuses First:EXPENSIVE.  Everyone's comments were spot-on.  Everything's a la carte and pricier than the competition.  And if you want to take advantage of the flexibility of the travel system (car seat adapter) and a second seat, you have to go ahead and buy the second seat to get the second seat adapters.  So your upfront investment is large.BIG.  While it is an in-line tandem, the price you pay for it's flexibility is the fact that one kid is centered over the front wheels.  All the other inlines put both kids within the wheelbase of the stroller.  So while the overall length of the stroller in single position is about the same as all the others, with the second seat, that kid is out front making the stroller almost a foot longer than the stroller length.  Some of the comments we saw are that the stroller is hard to steer with the heavy kid up front.  That's definitely true given the fact that pure physics dictates that with the kid's weight out over the front wheels, it's hard to pivot.  It's definitely not a deal breaker.  Any stroller with two kids is going to be hard to pivot on a dime.  And the weight over the front wheels also makes it harder to pop a wheelie and get it over a curb.  Fortunately, we're two dads and we're both easily strong enough to do that.  You simply put your foot on the back axle and tilt the stroller up.Car Seat adapter.  Awful quality and design in stark contrast to something like the Bugaboo's travel system.  The Bugaboo is a simple drop in, click, and then click the car seat right in.  Because they are trying to be Universal, it isn't ideal for any single brand.  Our Graco Snugride fits and is safe, but it's wobbly.  Putting the adapter in place also works, but it's just not as simple as the Bugaboo's drop in.  It takes two hands, you have to align each side (right and left) and then put a strap over the top.  It feels like a cheap shortcut.Positives:QUALITY.  The stroller exudes quality.  It's polished, solid, and rolls smoothly over all surfaces.  It is easy to put together in &lt; 5 minutes, and you can take it apart equally fast for travel.  Everything snaps or clicks into place with a solid thunk.  Everything fits together well and there are no rattles.  The Quartz fabric feels durable and hides dirt well.  The aluminum and the canvas and the wheels are all of high quality and feel bullet-proof.  The price for the stroller itself is probably appropriate and commensurate to its competition.Configurations.  With two boys so close in age, we figured that there will be the inevitable fighting and kicking, but also hopefully peaceful and loving playtime.  So the big attraction of the BJCS was the ability to put them facing together when they're good.  Or we can put them facing apart or both forward on the rare occasion that they aren't the perfect little angels we expect them to be.  The other inlines have one kid sitting below and behind the other.  We didn't want one kid to always feel he was getting a second-class seat without a view.  We also saw that configuration as an invitation for one kid to kick the other.  At least that would be what I would have done to my sibling at that age.Cargo.  Because of the way this stroller puts the second kid out front instead of down and behind, the entire storage basket is available for use.  It's huge.  You can fit a large diaper bag, a big purse (auntie's, not the dads'), and coats and sweaters from all the adults that are getting hot and sweaty pushing nearly 60 lbs. up a hill.  This basket holds everything you would want on a stroll or trip.  It's very useful for shopping trips and walking around all day because it carries so much and that you don't have to on your shoulders or back.OVERALL.  For our situation with two kids close in age, this stroller seemed ideal and it has lived up to its expectations.  It is not as maneuverable as our Bugaboo but it's head and shoulders better than a normal tandem.  It beats a side-by-side stroller for overall utility.  If your kids aren't going to be as close in age, the other inlines are going to be more maneuverable simply because all the weight is within the wheelbase of the stroller.  The downsides of those strollers are that you give up the storage basket and the one kid sits down and behind.",5,1
Gift Basket,"This is the perfect gift for a baby shower ! And at a good price . It arrived perfectly on time.The mother of the baby cried when she opened the amazon box and saw this gift basket. Next baby shower I'm invited to I'm definitely coming here for my gift . Or, when I decide to have a baby, I might just get this for myself lol.",5,1
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","Like many of us, I have gone through my fair-share of strollers over the past 7 years and multiple children.  I have never, however, gotten a travel system, let alone one so gorgeous.  Just in the first week of using it, many people have asked about it and expressed their envy.  Not a reason to get it, by any means, just trying to put into context how nice it looks.Ok, now some pros and cons:PROS: Nice and huge underneath storage which is accessible from the back or three zippered access points (front and both sides), so even when you switch the seat direction (which takes no extra equipment or strength) you can still get your essentials plus.  The sunshade provides a full 135 degrees of coverage (the only one I have found better is the City Mini at 180 degrees) and has cool magnetic connectors sewn into the fabric to firmly hold the viewer window flap.  Also, the all mesh window allows for good air circulation versus a plastic shield.  Additionally, each of the velcro holding points for all the covers holds perfectly and firmly and have never required and readjustment.  The ride is very smooth thanks to large but not oversized wheels and is nicely assisted by two simple side shocks that are built into the frame and don't interfer or stand out.  I also appreciate the adjustability of the seat belt, specifically for my toddler, since she likes to sit up and lean forward - I can simply put the waist straps on (the shoulder straps are separate and can be tucked away).  The stroller turns easily with a great turning radius and even with double seats installed all manuoevers can still be done with one hand.  The designed brake system works smoothly with an easy touch of just one foot (to apply and also release) and allows you to clearly see its status through a green or red color indicator.  Both seats have easy (one handed) and smooth recline/incline adjustabilty into three different positions. It also folds up easily and stands up on its own (using a single seat).The second seat is nice for times my older child needs to ride because she's sick and I have to walk to pick up another child at school. Otherwise, the single is perfect for up to 50 lbs, the second up to 35 lbs.CONS: 1) After just a week, the silver color already shows stains. Although she does eat in it, it's never anything too messy, so I'm surprised that the fabric already looks stained. I wish it could be easily removed like carseat covers and washed on gentle, but not possible. 2) the removable parent console fits nicely into designated holder slots at the bottom of the stroller, but there is not a great place to relocate it to the top. And, when positioned at the bottom it is not easily accesible for the parent while walking.  So if you have the double seat in you cannot reach that console at all. Also if you do relocate this parent console to the top, you can't recline the seat fully 3) it is a little wider than some of the other strollers I have had in the past.A really great stroller overall. Best we've had!",5,1
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","Bought this in anticipation of using it as a double with the extra seat. We tested every double/convertible double out there and this one was by far the most compact (without squishing the passengers).  Our runner-up was the Baby Jogger City Select, but once the second seat was on it, it was as long as a train!  We love that the overall footprint and turning radius of the Britax doesn't change once you put on the second seat.We haven't been able to use it as a double yet (waiting for baby #2), but love it as a single. Huge storage basket, adjustable everything, cupholder (negative reviewers seem to have installed it wrong. Have to click it over the plastic nub, otherwise it is flimsy), access to the storage from all sides, super easy to steer with one hand, great sunshade, and we love that the seat can face us or away.If we could change something, this would be it:1.  make the seat recline further.  Our little guy really likes to lay flat to sleep.  Out and about naps don't seem to happen in this stroller because it doesn't fully recline.  We could buy a bassinet, but at his age, he also likes being able to sit up.2.  There is no real way to close this with one hand. Or open it with one hand.  Not super convenient, but once you get used to it, its not a big deal.3. Yeah, it's heavy, but as something that converts to a double stroller that can carry two growing toddlers, what can you expect?  I'm not too upset about the weight, but i guess if there was a way to make it lighter, that would be great! Surprisingly, it can be folded up quite compact with one seat still attached if you figure out how to do it right -- its actually more compact than our Chicco stroller when folded properly.I don't think its an absolutely perfect stroller, which is why I gave 4 stars.  However, we looked at every stroller on the market and there was no stroller better (for our needs) that converts to a double.  Defintely the best one out there right now!  Would buy again in a heartbeat!",4,1
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","I received this stroller 6 months ago. I searched forever for the perfect stroller. I got it put together and is nice quality. It's components all work smooth,pushes great,tons of storage in basket. Like the durability of the material and the fact I can reverse the seat and see her. It's easy to fold, but there is no place to really be able to hold it to carry, and it bulky and a little on heavier side. My baby is 18 months and loves being able to see me but it does not sit upright enough so she is constantly trying to pull herself up to sit up, which in turn makes her frustrated and unfortunately doesn't enjoy being in there. The weight makes it hard to travel with and check at airport. I never did find a travel bag big enough for it. Although I really love the stroller, the biggest thing I don't like about it is it is so wide that it hard to get through lots of doorways and isle at mall shops,etc. It would be great if they would make it just a little bit narrower. Now I have a B ready stroller I'm selling, cause for my needs, something reversible,light for traveling through airports, big sun canopy,and descent storage underneath, I just received my Bumbleride flyer stroller,which seems to fit my lifestyle. Overall, the B Ready is a very nice stroller though.",4,1
"My Brest Friend Original Pillow, Bluebells","I own a boppy, which is nice, but not for breastfeeding.  It slides around and just isn't practical for me.  I have been using my brestfriend since day one in the hospital (I had a c section) and this pillow has been indispensable.  The buckle is what makes it so special, I clip this thing on and can walk around and sit while breastfeeding.  It also acts as a little baby table, as a new first time mom learning to breastfeed, I felt like I needed a third hand to get the positioning just right, but with the pillow I was able to get everything where it was supposed to be to get the perfect latch.  Do yourself a favor if you are serious about breastfeeding and don't wait to see if you will really need it.  The cover can be tricky to put back on after you wash it and it seems to have shrunk a little bit despite gentle washing and air drying.  One last thing. . . I wasn't sure about the Mod Pod pattern, the picture just wasn't very clear, however as soon as I recieved it I knew I had made the right pattern choice.  It is very very nice in person.",5,1
Britax Infant Car Seat Adapter Frame,"It took me a while to know this even existed. In a stroke of desperation, after lots of back pain from trying to carry my Chicco Keyfit 30 with 14 lbs of baby in from a distant parking lot, I searched for this item for my B Agile. It arrived in 2 days and I have been the happiest mom ever since. It works great with my seat. My baby didn't settle into the stroller and would wake up, so having him ride in his seat is perfect. You can fold the b agile with the attachment on, but I remove mine each time as it has To fit into the back of an outback with a dog crate. It's easy to remove and reinstall. Takes two seconds! One word of caution though, it does make the b agile somewhat less maneuverable. I think it's the extra weight, combined with that weight being high. It makes the three wheels seem a bit less steady, and I find I need two hands to steer easily, whereas I could drive the b agile alone easily with one hand. Still a great product. Solves all my problems.",5,1
Dreambaby Madison Xtra Tall Swing Close Gate- Black White,Excellent product!  We have an American Eskimo Dog who can leap tall buildings in a single bound!  This gate is amazing.  The curved top is perfect for keeping her in or out of the living room.  It is very easily removed if necessary.  You will not be disappointed.,5,1
"Britax Roundabout 55 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx","This car seat is almost perfect.  It is very comfy for my little girl!  The fabric is very soft and she always seems very happy in the seat, even facing backwards at 14 months.  The colors are a great compliment to my car's dark grey and black seats.  I read some complaints about the seat cover not staying on when they put their child in and out, which had me worried, but I haven't experienced that at all - the cover stays perfectly in its place.  The seat stays in place and is easy to instal, now that I know how to do it.  I like the seat so much that I got one to keep at my parent's house and one for our other car (moving the car seat from car to car was such a pain).The only reasons I didn't give the car seat a 5 are that it is kind of tricky to install and the latch to loosen the straps is hard to use when the seat is rear facing.  If I could give it 4.75 stars, I would.  The difficult part of installation was figuring out the tether in the rear facing position.  This is one of the few car seats with a rear facing tether, so even the fire department I got it checked at had to call in for help.  In my Honda  CR-V there is a latch on the back side of the back seat, so we tried the tether using the Australian method (over the back seat), but that was ridiculous - the straps were totally in the way of putting my baby in and out of the seat.  Then we tried the Sweedish method (per the suggestion from the Britax customer service) - wrapping the strap around a bolted part of the car and attaching the latch to that - but the seatbelt track was wide and the strap wouldn't fit around.  With a little help from my Dad, and a few tries, we were able to get around the seat belt track.  Now that I know how to do it, it is a piece of cake, but the first couple of tries were super tricky and not near as easy as my Chicco infant seat.",4,1
"Britax Marathon 70 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx","I bought the Britax Marathon 70 carseat for my car as I care for my year old grandson. I read the reviews and went with this carseat because consumer report scored it so highly and it was within my price range. This carseat is also the one that my son and his wife have in their cars. They both love the seat for its ease of use and safety. I drive a small car and the seat fits perfectly. The installation instructions were confusing and difficult to follow but my son was able to install the seat without any difficulty. As an older user,I am able to use the carseat belts and buckles without any difficulty and my grandson has a great view and a comfortable, safe ride!",5,1

Baby Trend Walker With Toy Bar,"We are on our second Baby Trend walker (gave the first away. duh!) and our third child. This is the ONLY walker that was the perfect height, the perfect weight (not too heavy) and has wheels that swivel 360 degrees (so they have amazing mobility) for our children. My current baby zooms all over our house and will spend a long time in there if allowed. It is an indispensable item in our home. He just has a ball literally running around the house. You can purchase this item for a lot less at another main baby product retailer (BRU). You will not be let down.",4,1
The Shrunks Sleep Secure Inflatable Bed Rail,"We traveled with our preschooler and stayed in 4 different hotels on a trip, and this bed rail worked perfectly.  We placed it under the hotel bed sheets, it stayed put, and definitely kept her from rolling off the beds.  I didn't have any problem with the sheet sizes, it tucked under just fine.  Its small, so easy to pump up and deflate.  A great, useful product to have for traveling families.",5,1

Little Remedies New Parents Survival Kit,This is perfect for new parents who are willing to try a remedy in the middle of the night when you can't get ahold of your pediatrician.,5,1
Little Remedies New Parents Survival Kit,"I would be safe in saying this was the best shower gift we received! The nose aspirator is great quality as well as the nail clippers. Unfortunately our son is very colicky, so the gripe water and gas drops were a lifesaver. I would recommend this kit to any new parent. If you are looking for the perfect shower gift, look no further, the expectant parents will sing your praises for giving this as a gift!!!!",5,1
"The Lil' Houdini Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Newborn (5-10 lbs), Vanilla)","My son wriggled out of all other swaddles, and I'd find him in his crib with the thing over his head!  This was perfect!!  The first night he slept longer than he had with other ones.  It was easy to get in and out of, and I didn't feel like I was holding him down to wrap him up.  We put him in this, and put him in a swing to sleep.  He slept through the night for many months like that.  When he could roll over, we took him out of it and he's been sleeping on his stomach since.  He loved this thing, and I wish I had found it earlier!!!",5,1
"HALO and The Happiest Baby Safe and Sound Sleep Gift Set, Cream, Newborn","Swaddling is tricky business, and this fleece swaddle removes all guesswork from the equation, providing great swaddling comfort to your baby every time. My daughter is now 3 months old, and I swear by this swaddling blanket. She has been sleeping through the night--8-10 hours--everyday for the past month and I credit the blanket because as soon as I wrap her in it, she falls into deep sleep, and wakes up with a big sweet smile in the morning. The free CD from Dr. Karp was awesome too! I set it to the strong hair dryer sound, which succeeds marvelously at blocking out noises that can startle and awaken a sleeping baby, and the sound plus the snug swaddle is the perfect combo!My daughter no longer needs the hair dryer sound to sleep well, and she is getting a bit too big for the swaddle already, so we may have to shift to a sleep suit soon, but as any parent would know, the first 3 months are important to establish good sleeping habits, and this Halo sleep set helped us achieve just that. Worth every penny!",5,1
"RECARO ProSPORT Combination Harness To Booster Car Seat, Blue Opal","This is my second time buying the Recaro Prosport Combo Harness to Booster Carseat as we were recently rear-ended and I needed to replace the one we had.  We also owned the Recaro Convertible Carseat previously before purchasing the Prosport seat.  My son is almost 5 years old and loves the Prosport seat.  He is 38 lbs and 41 inches long and still using the harness and I haven't had any problems with the straps being too short like another reviewer commented on.  I cannot say enough good things about Recaro.  They obviously know about safety since they have been manufacturing seats for race cars for 40 years.  The woman's car who hit me was totaled and my son was not hurt at all.  The car seat was in perfect condition but I'm told that once any carseat is in an accident, it must be replaced so here I am buying another and I wouldn't choose any other brand.",5,1
Protective Bottle Sleeve 4 oz (pack of 2),"I bought these because my son goes to a day care twice a week and they require sleeves for glass bottles. This is my third baby so I already had the Born free glass bottles and didn't want to spent more money. These Dr, Browns fit my Born free glass bottles perfectly. They are of course tight and a little hard to get on but all the sleeves are that way. Good price too. I contacted Born Free prior to this purchase and they wanted to charge me the same price as purchasing a new bottle. I was not willing to do that so this worked perfectly. It is difficult to see the amount of liquid in the bottle but I estimate. Great purchase.",5,1

phil&amp;teds Wriggle Wrapper - Grey,"I am confined to a power wheelchair and my 3 month old granddaughter loves sitting on my lap and let's me know she much prefers moving to sitting still.  I tried two front-facing infant carriers before I stumbled across the Wiggle Wrapper.  It is so perfect for my needs and I cannot stress how securely baby is fastened in.  If it works for me, it will work for securing baby on an airplane.",5,1
"Delta LX Side by Side Tandem Umbrella Stroller, Lime Green","Just received my double stroller and so far we love it! Fits perfectly through standard 30 in doors, swivels very well and moves smoothly. I also like that the handles are up higher than the traditional single umbrella strollers are. They are also very soft and cushioned. My daughters love it and seem very comfortable. The only con is that the sun shade is relatively small and doesn't really cover much. Additional colors would be nice and two cup holders would be a nice asset but overall we love it.",4,1
"Trend Lab Blanket Gift Cake, Dr Seuss ABC Print","I ordered this for a friend, she received it yesterday and said it was perfect.

Flip: One-Size Snap Closure Diaper Cover - Blossom,"These are really great covers. They're a little big so I had to wait for my son to grow into them, but once he did I found myself reaching for them more and more often. I have one of the microfiber inserts which is nice and trim, but I mostly just carry that in my diaper bag since it's small and we use prefolds most of the time. You can either tri-fold the prefold and lay it flat in the cover or use a snappi, but I use the tri-fold in these because it's faster. None of my Flip covers have ever stained, they've all held up perfectly, and at 15 months old he still has plenty of room to grow. I've never found the lack of gusset in these to be a problem compared to all of the other gusset-less diapers I tried that leaked. I highly recommend these.",5,1

"Tiny Love Take Along Mobile, Animal Friends","I thought this would be a little bigger. It fits perfect on my pack and play, which I was nervous about because the pack and play is from 13 years ago when my brother & son were born! I think because it is small it seems harder for my daughter to see (she is only 2 months though). It is very cute and I love that it is battery operated. I like the music it plays too.",4,1
"Tiny Love Take Along Mobile, Animal Friends",I purchased this item to take along with my son to day care for his crib. It is perfect for this and to put on a pack n play. The music is soothing and quiet. The mobile spins at a nice rate. It also has an option to have no music and only the mobile which was great too. I'm so pleased with this and will recommend it to my friends!,5,1
"Tiny Love Take Along Mobile, Animal Friends","My 3 month old loves this mobile.  The music is lovely, good sound and the perfect volume.  It seemed small compared to a regular crib mobile but my baby really seems to like it just as much.",5,1
Baby Hip Hugger 'Classic' - Beige,"SUMMARY:This hip seat is great, if you can get it for a lower price.BETTER PRICES ON EBAY:I actually purchased the same item from eBay for a much lower price.  I paid about $48 on eBay, which seemed okay for my budget.  Paying $70 for a souped-up fanny pack on Amazon just seemed like way too much money for me, especially since I wasn't sure if I'd like it.  Note that the hip seat I got on eBay wasn't called Baby Nari -- it had no brand name -- but it was literally the SAME item.  I compared close-up photos, and as far as I can tell, they must have been made by the same manufacturer. If you search for ""baby hip seat"" on eBay, a number of options come up. Mine was shipped from Korea.PROS: VERY USEFUL!I've owned my hip seat for about 2 years now, and I think it is very useful.  I don't use it all the time, but when I do, I'm really glad to have it!  I originally bought it because I have twins, and when I was caring for two 20-pound 1 year olds by myself, ordinary baby carriers that put the babies on my back were impossible -- you can't switch back and forth between kids.  This hip carrier is perfect for switching back and forth between kids, or for excursions where there is a lot of up-and-down (Carry me!  No, now I want to walk!), or for quick trips where you don't want the hassle of a stroller or a large baby carrier (like walking from the parking lot to the doctor's office).Two additional situations when it's AWESOME to have a hip seat:(1) Going to the zoo!  The kids are too short to see most of the exhibits at the zoo, so we had to pick them up all the time.  Glad I brought my hip carrier! The day after our trip to the zoo, my back was fine but my husband's was sore.(2) Soothing a crying kid in your arms!  One of my kids suffered from really bad night terrors, and on many nights he would spend about 20-60 minutes in my arms wailing.  Sometimes in the middle of the night I'd walk around with him in the back yard for a while to help him catch his breath and relax.  Without the hip carrier, my arms and back would have been hurting in the morning!CONS:(1) This hip seat isn't really meant for long walks.  It is best for short excursions.  I think my limit for walking with a 25-pound toddler is about 15 minutes before I need to put him down or switch sides.(2) You have to use one arm to hold onto the kid, so it isn't a hands-free option.(3) It looks kind of dorky, but oh well!",4,1

"dexbaby Safe Sleeper Convertible Crib Bed Rail, White",My 2yo twins suddenly started climbing out of their cribs and forced us to convert their cribs to toddler beds.

"Tilty Slow Flow Cup Lids, 2 Pack","These lids work perfectly for the yogurt smoothies I make for my daughter. She loves yogurt, but makes a mess eating it. With these, there is none of the mess. I just mix her yogurt with some milk & it's good to go! The Tilty cup itself was hard for her to hold until she was about 10 months old, as it's kind of wide for little hands. We love the Tilty!",5,1
"Baby Blinds Breastfeeding Cover (Regular, Taylor)","I have the Olivia cover, which I used with my first baby and now I'm using it with my second. It is such a great product for such a great price!!! The fabric is perfect...light-weight enough to keep you and baby from over-heating. I definitely wouldn't want the fabric to be any thicker! I also just love the pattern--very stylish. In fact, I think all of the patterns are super-cute! I highly recommend this product to ALL breastfeeding moms!!! You can tell this was created by an experienced mother!!!",5,1

"Maya Wrap Lightly Padded Baby Ring Sling-New Colors for 2010 (Medium, Pink Fusion)",Bought this when my son was a few weeks old and we both loved it. It enabled me to take care of my 2 year old while he was safely snuggled in the sling. Also i could secretly breastfeed when out and no one could see or know. Now he is 5 months and it is perfect for when we are out and he can face forward,5,1

Britax B-Ready Stroller and 2nd Seat - Green,"I have owned 14 strollers with my four kids searching for the perfect one that fit our needs, was durable, and adjusted for different age gaps and children using it. This stroller is simply perfection. I have been using it for a few months now and couldn't be happier. With the car seat attachment or the regular seat, both my baby and toddler (as well as occasionally my preschooler) have enjoyed this stroller. Has a great baggage compartment on the bottom, is easy to maneuver, and has made this busy mom very happy. Worth every penny.",5,1
Gocrib Portable Baby Travel Crib and Play Yard,"We got this as a gift when our daughter was born 12 months ago.  At first we were not sure because it was unlike others our friends had or that we had researched.Let me tell you, it is great.  Blow it up in less than 60 seconds with the included pump.  Take it down in about the same time, maybe a couple minutes.  All fits into a backpack bag.  We take it everywhere and have used it as a ""crib"" when visiting friends or family.*A note, get the Cotton Fitted Sheet and the Plush Quilted Sheet accessories from Guava Family.  They fit perfectly and the Plush is very soft and comfortable.  The regular cotton is probably better if it is really warm as it is thinner and a bit cooler to lay on.Would definitely get it again!",5,1
Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"I wish I had bought this years ago! It is spanned across our open concept home to keep my kids out of the kitchen/dining area. It is not wobbling like I thought it might, very sturdy and is working PERFECTLY! I now have a little bit of sanity back and am able to keep my home a lot safer for my young kids. I have also used it to hold my German Shorthair Pointer puppies. Love that the kids and dogs can't climb over it (so far!).",5,1
Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"Perfect for a wood burning stove but I don't think the latch would hold up to all day daily use, its kinda flimsy. I just step over the gate when I use it.",4,1
Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"This product came already put together, and it was very easy to get setup. I was a little worried about it being sturdy enough because I was using it for a play yard for my 8 month old. Well it definitely exceeded my expectations , and the white powder coated metal very easy on the eyes and didn't clash with my decor. My baby is at the stage where he is pulling himself up on everything, and this product is plenty sturdy so that he does not knock it over , and it is the perfect height as well. I am so glad I ordered it.",5,1
"Regalo Right Height Booster Seat, Watermelon",The chair is perfect for our 3-year old. It gives her the extra height to sit at the dining room table. The main thing to plan for is that the chair is very wide. It hangs over a little on one side when strapped to the chair. If you have small chairs this may not work for you.,4,1
"Regalo Extra Tall Widespan Gate, White",This is a perfect gate when having a new born baby and two dogs! I never have to walk over or keep moving the gate every time I wish to go into thee other room which is great. The gate is metal so the dogs wont chew on it which is a huge plus!,4,1
"Regalo Extra Tall Widespan Gate, White","The height is perfect. The width... not so much. The doorway is too narrow to use both extensions on the gate, but too wide to only use one. Otherwise the size is great.I use the gate to keep my cats out of the kitchen and dining room, but the gaps between the bars are just wide enough that one of the cats can squeeze through. I saw a few other reviews mentioning similar, so I was almost expecting this to happen. If you're thinking of this gate to use with a cat or cats, I suggest you prepare for a similar experience. I'm going to weave strips of fabric through the bars and block the open areas. Hopefully that will be enough to keep my feline Houdini from escaping all the time.With those exceptions, the gate is perfect. It seems to be a lightweight but sturdy gate; it fits my home much better than the old plastic sliding gate I used to have. I'm short and was sick and tired of stepping over it all the time and knocking it loose because I'm not tall enough to clear it easily. I love that this gate has a door in it and that each corner cab be adjusted individually. It fits much better.So all in all, not completely perfect for my home, but the most perfect gate I've found so far.",4,1
"Regalo Extra Tall Top of Stair Gate, White",We bought this gate for the bottom of our stairs. Its a perfect fit. I wish it opened wider for walk thru. Also wish it came in black. I'm thinking about spray painting it soon.,4,1
"Bright Starts Walk-A-Bout Walker, Cute Frog","I got this walker for a new grandson of a friend mine. My friend was somewhat concerned that at 6 months the little guy wasn't showing any desire to walk on his own. His grandson and family live about 100 miles away, so it wouldn't be practical for him to give daily walking lessons.The obvious alternative - Get A Walker. We found this item on Amazon & it seemed like the perfect solution. I ordered it for him, with it to be delivered directly to his daughter's home. This order becomes another classic example of why Amazon is #1 with me.The walker arrived in less than 24 hours, without even requesting overnight delivery. By all accounts from the recipient it deserves 5 stars+. The little lad, who previously had been leading a rather sedentiary life has found new mobility. According to the mom, as soon as she un-packed the walker her son was tearing up the house in it. Again, according to the mother - ""He loves it"" & it seems very sturdy and durable. The mom, &  at some point in  the future, the little guy will no doubt be loyal Amazon customers",5,1
"Bright Starts Walk-A-Bout Walker, Cute Frog","Perfect for our needs, little wheels glide easily over our wood floors. They have a little bit of trouble on the carpet but most of our house is tile or wood. Easy to assemble, very feminine and the toys keep her occupied when she isn't buzzing around the house. My only complaint is that I found it for 34.99 at Ross the day after it arrived, but $5 isnt worth a return for something already assembled and my little loves it.",5,1
Baby Trend Expedition ELX Travel System Stroller - Everglade,Ok so let me start by saying I have last years model that came without the mp3 speakers. I also bought this item from Babies R Us but I wanted to actually give viewers a review on the product itself and not just complain about the price.I am currently training for a marathon. I also just had my baby 3 months ago. When she was 3 days old we took her to the local parade and this stroller was perfect. Our next outing was at 5 days old and we went for a mile walk. She did not shake around at all. It is very sturdy. We have taken it on many trips and it is very lightwieght so I have no problem loading it in my SUV.I am currently taking this out for 5 miles at a time and my baby just loves it and sleeps the entire time. I love the swivel wheel for when we go shopping.I did not need any bells and whistles in a stroller. I wanted something that was easy for me to load and comfortable for my baby and this stroller is.,5,1
Baby Trend Expedition ELX Travel System Stroller - Everglade,"If you walk everywhere like I do or jog occasionally, this stroller is perfect. However, if you're a hardcore runner or don't have lots of smooth surfaces around you, I wouldn't recommend it.We've had this stroller for about a month and so far I really like it. We bought it because we live near a park with tons of trails (dirt and paved) for runners and walkers. I use it 4-5 x / week and I am so glad I bought it. I wish I would've gotten it sooner. Our daughter is 8 months.I would say that there are mostly pros, but several cons that some might want to take into consideration before buying.Pros1. Comfortable for my daughter. She sleeps in it all the time. When she's in the carseat, the two covers work perfectly to block out sun and wind.2. I can take it anywhere. Street, mall, stores, cafe, trails. The front wheel locks and unlocks making it easy to switch from jogging outside to walking around in a mall.3. It takes me 2 seconds to fold it and put into my car trunk. And the carseat snaps in and out of both the stroller and the base in the car very quickly.4. The storage basket underneath is huge! I love it. I'ved filled it with two bags of groceries, jackets, toys etc. and it held everything no problem.5. Handle is comfortable and adjusts for different heights. I'm 5'2"" and my husband is 5'11"" and we can easily switch the height for either one of us.6. We liked the fact that it's a jogger with the all-terrain wheels, but that it also had the carseat attachment, so that our baby could see us and vice versa.Cons1. If you're outside and the front wheel is unlocked, and you walk too fast, the whole stroller shakes. It's scary. (It's perfect for when you're inside a store) So, I keep the front wheel locked most of the time when I'm outside.2. It's heavy (with the carseat attachment). Because I keep the front wheel locked most of the time, when I want to turn a corner or get on or off sidewalks, I have to tilt the whole stroller back to lift the front wheel up and it takes some effort. Granted, I'm short, so maybe I don't have the leverage for it, but even my husband felt like it was heavier than it should be. This will probably be easier once we take the carseat attachment off and my daughter rides facing forward.3. The cupholders are too small for my standard metal water bottle. We just removed ours entirely and replaced it with a different holder, the Sunshine Kids buggySunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddywhich works perfectly. The only problem now is that I can't use the MP3 player since it was attached to the cupholders.Overall I would recommend this stroller! Hope this helps.",4,1
"Baby Jogger 2011 City Mini Single Stroller, Black/Black","I love this stroller! It is so easy to open and fold. It folds into nothing, kind of like a beach chair when folded down.  I was so sick of my Bugaboo stroller taking up so much room in my truck and wanted something that was sturdier and more substantial than my Maclaren. This is just the perfect stroller for cruising around town easily!",5,1
"Baby Jogger 2011 City Mini Double Stroller, Black/Black","Before purchasing this stroller, I read several reviews online and tried it out in a store.  I found that using the stroller on a daily basis was an entirely different experience and wanted to share that so that you can make an informed decision.Background: I own two other double strollers, a Graco Quattro Tour Duo (that's a tandem) and a Maclaren Twin Techno (that's a side by side umbrella).  I have two children, age 18 months and age 1 month.First, I would like to address those who are looking for a jogging stroller.  This stroller is not a jogging stroller, and is not intended to be per the company, so it's not fair to review the stroller based on it's jogging abilities.  However, since so many people seem to want to jog with this stroller, I will note that I have tried both jogging and running with this stroller for review purposes and it is an excellent stroller when used as intended but if you want to jog or run buy one of the jogging strollers in their line.Ok, for those of you looking for a great everyday stroller, this is it!Storage:  In terms of weight, this stroller isn't a feather, but no double stroller is.  In comparison to others, it is light and reasonable to lift in and out of a trunk.  It also folds flat, so while you need a bit of space width wise, it can go flat in a trunk and leave room for other items (I fit it in the trunk of my Chevy Cavalier with room for diapers, groceries, and other things) or fit inside easily (we store ours in the hall closet).  Folding the stroller is easy- just pull up on the two straps located on the seats and the stroller folds right in half- though I will say there are a few times I went to fold it and I needed to shake it a bit to get it to fold all of the way.  What's great is that it can also fold flat with the belly bar attached, so you don't have to remove and reattach it every time.  Also, the wheels do pop off easily to fold it even flatter, but I haven't needed to do so and I wouldn't imagine it would be necessary as it really doesn't make much of a space difference.  [Note: Put the seats up and fold the hoods back before folding.]  Overall Storage: the stroller is light, easy to fold, and can fit in even a small trunk with plenty of room to spare.Quality: The stroller is sturdy and well-made.  The handlebar is has a nice rubber grip, not those cheap foam handle grips that come on a lot of strollers.  The actual frame of the stroller is of high quality and the material is durable, which is necessary since the stroller folds out so it has to be durable to avoid rips.  I find the black easy to clean, though I haven't taken it off to wash yet and also I store it indoors so sun fading isn't an issue for me.  The snaps and velcro parts are well secured and function appropriately, and the moving parts (seat, hood, folding mechanism, wheels) all work smoothly.  [Note: I did notice a squeak in the front wheel, but it resolved on its own].  Overall Quality: Built to last with excellent construction, fabric, and working mechanisms.Features:  Starting from the top, the handlebar has a great grip, but it is not adjustable.  At 5'5"" to 5'9"" we have found it to be a perfect height, although if your arms aren't extended enough you may find your feet hit the stroller or your knees hit the seat when the child is reclined back all of the way.  There are no accessories with this stroller like a cup holder or child trays- you can buy accessories for it but for the price it would be nice for the stroller to come with at least a cup holder; however, keep in mind that sometimes those accessories add weight or make it more difficult to fold.  I don't miss the kid trays at all, as it means I'm just not feeding them in the stroller and in turn keeps the stroller cleaner.  I did purchase the belly bar accessory which I personally consider a great accessory, but I will review that separately.  The seats recline easily, and because they secure with a strap, they are able to be adjusted to any recline, not set reclines like some, and the movement is very smooth, as opposed to the jerkey movements of strollers with set reclines, so that the child can be reclined if they fall asleep sitting up and the motion won't wake them up.  The seats also have a mesh opening when reclined all of the way to allow for airflow and a flap which can cover that opening in colder or windy weather.  Unfortunately, the openings in the mesh is too large to keep mosquitos and other bugs out, so you will need a bug screen that goes around the entire stroller if you decide to purchase one.  The seats have a supportive back (new for the 2011 model) and comfortably fit most children up to age 4.  My son is old enough to communicate to me when he is comfortable and when he isn't, and at 18 months he is very comfortable in this stroller for long, extended walks as long as I sit him up all of the way and use the provided straps to secure his seat in the upmost position.  The reclines also are individual so the children don't have to be at the same recline, and because the seats are separated in the middle, the children can't really touch each other, so it is possible to have one child sitting up awake and one lying flat sleeping without being disturbed by the awake child.  My other son at a month old however is too small for the seats on this stroller because of the position of the harnesses.  The stroller is not intended for children under 6 months old without purchasing and using either the bassinet or car seat accessories, but I actually put my son in it anyhow.  I won't downgrade it's rating for not fitting him properly because it's not intended for his age, but I do want to add that I have adjusted it so that I feel that he is indeed safe and I can use it for him even at a month old, so it can be done.  The harnesses are ok in this stroller, just ok.  They are difficult to adjust, but once they are adjusted properly they work fine.  I don't think it's safe to put the child in the stroller without the harness on (some strollers have a child tray that functions in such a way that an older child doesn't really need to be strapped in) as there is nothing stopping the child from falling out, so follow the instructions and properly secure your children.  The footrests are also just ok- functional but I'd imagine that in time they will see a lot of wear being that they are just the same cloth material as the seats, but they work find and actually my 18 month old is able to use them to get himself into the stroller (which I want to note he can do without tipping it over, so it's more stable than I thought it would be). As far as the brake, it is a simple footbrake that keeps the stroller from rolling, and the front wheels can lock or swivel, both simple features found on most strollers these days.  The hoods are not typical however, they are exceptional.  They fold down to three different heights and can completely block out the sun [disclaimer: there have been a few angles of sun which I couldn't block out from time to time, but these hoods did a better job than either of the other two strollers I own].  The hoods have two windows which allow you to see the baby, but also have velcro which keeps those windows covered when you want them covered or holds back the little flap when you want them open- not something you'd think about ahead of time, but I'm glad they thought of it because those little details make this an excellent stroller.  Overall features: great features, could have some included accessories for the price but the stroller has everything needed without being excessive.  I would rather have the stroller be priced where it is and pick out my own accessories rather than have it cost more and be fitted with things I don't want/need.  The features are comparable to other high end umbrella strollers, like the Maclaren Twin Techno I own, in similar price categories.Storage:  This gets it's own category because I think it's important to discuss for any parent, especially with two little ones.  There is a basket underneath the stroller, but don't think that you'll be using it often- it is very difficult to get into compared with other strollers and there really is no way to get a large diaper bag in there.  However, I use a smaller bag with just diapers and wipes in there.  If I bring a larger diaper bag, I hang it off the stroller.  You can purchase one that snaps onto the side, but I was ok with just hanging mine when needed.  There are also two mesh pockets on the back of the seats which can be used to store items, but of course when the seats are reclined all of the way this becomes difficult, plus the pockets are a bit deep for storing things like a cell phone that you want to get to easily.  This is the one area where this stroller lacks in comparison to other strollers; however, if comparing it to other high-end umbrella strollers, none of them have great storage.  I believe that using hooks to hang things has solved this for me and honestly, I've just learned to travel with what I need, not tons of other things, and I wouldn't trade how great this stroller is for the storage of another stroller because the rest of this stroller is just too good to pass up.  I suppose it depends on how often you need to load it up, but if you think you need a lot of storage, try it out at a store near you first to see if this is a deal-breaker for you; it wasn't a problem for me.Use:  It flips open easily and with a quick fasten of four safety snaps you're ready to roll.  You have to unfasten those four little safety snaps before folding the stroller, but it takes a second once your used to it and it's well worth it for how easily flat it folds compared to other double strollers.  Once the kids are bucked in and you're strolling, you will notice that if a child is fully reclined your knees may hit the back of the seat if you walk too close to the stroller, but that has only happened once to one of us and all of the other times we've used it (always with at least one seat reclined for the baby) it hasn't been an issue.  Your feet may also kick the bottom if you are walking too close to the stroller (which usually happens when trying to job with it, which again it's not intended for).  From personal experience, this hasn't been an issue for us.  The brake can hold the stroller from rolling even when the kids are in it and it's on a hill.  As far as movement, this stroller has an extremely smooth ride- when we first pushed it after using the other strollers we own, we felt like we were pushing air in comparison.  The front wheels can be locked, although we haven't had to lock them and the ride has still been very smooth, which may be in part due to the shock absorbing front end.  The wheels are big enough to be very smooth over pavement and dirt, although they aren't air filled so don't expect this to function as an all-terrain stroller- it doesn't and it isn't supposed to.  Even over grass the stroller protests a bit when loaded with the kids, but I still find it much more manageable even over grass than the other two strollers we owned.  Though I missed not being able to snap the car seat in and go, I actually am really glad now that this stroller doesn't have that feature because my baby seems to like being in the stroller more than the car seat and most kids are out of the baby car seats by 6 months or so, and remember this stroller isn't intended for kids under 6 months old anyhow.  Now for the amazing part: weight distribution.  One of my children weighs 30 pounds and the other weighs 10 pounds; I can easily push the stroller without it pulling to one side.  In fact, when in the store I loaded one side up with a pack n play and put my son in the other side to see how it would push loaded with two large children and it pushed just as easily.  I've also used it with just my older son in it and had no issues pushing it easily- it didn't pull to one side.  This stroller handles children of different weights easily and perhaps is for me the best feature of the stroller.  I have also hung things off of it despite the manufacturer recommending not to and haven't had any issues with weight distribution there or with tipping- again, this is a very well-made stroller that functions awesome.  In fact, it is so easy to push that fully loaded I can turn it with one hand and I have also been able to push it with one hand while walking on the side of the stroller (yes, the side) without an issue!  I also want to note that even though it's side by side, this stroller fits through average doorways- I have fit in many stores and down most isles- if a wheelchair can fit, this stroller can fit, which is a great feature when shopping.  Overall use: User friendly, extremely easy to push, and great for kids of different weights/ages- plus it fits!In short, this stroller is amazing.  It may not have all of the accessories, but you get a higher-quality, well-made stroller than functions very well as intended and is able to maneuver easily, even when loaded unevenly, and can fit through doorways and isles.  This is a great buy and even at the price is worth the investment as it's a stroller you will actually enjoy pushing.  Five stars!UPDATE:  I have noticed a few things about this stroller that are important to note.  1) You really can't hang things off of the handlebar.  I hung some heavy grocery bags and while it didn't tip, I noticed it put a lot of strain on the stroller and think over time that would ruin it.  So, it may be ok to hang some light things, but nothing too heavy, which is too bad since the under-the-seat storage is not that useable while shopping.  On the bright side, I forgot about the stroller one day last week and left it out in the rain!  I was devastated and thought it was destroyed because a lot of strollers get a mildew smell and have trouble drying out.  However, this stroller has an umbrella-like material and the rain literally just shook off of it!  Again, I still think this is a terrific stroller and now I'm glad to see that it can ""survive"" the elements as well!",5,1
Jungle Wall Stencils for Jungle Theme Wall Mural for Baby Room,"I love this kit. We were rearranging the kids because we were having another, and moving the 8 yr old girl and 2 yr old boy into a room together. So we wanted something gender neutral, and not cutesy or cartoony. This was the perfect look! I was able to use each stencil several times (especially important for the flowers and butterflies and clouds), fairly easy to use, and soooo versatile! I had to make myself stop on adding some of the stuff! I already had some paint (I'm an amateur artist myself, but not ready for murals!), so I could really play with colors. But the paint kit they also offer would have otherwise been very handy!Cons: a little pricey, I wished it cost less, but I still bought it, so take from it what you will. Some of the stencils didn't sit quite right, in particular the stripes didn't line up perfectly over the zebra or tiger. I had to line up the front half, paint that and let it dry, then re-position to get the back end lined up and painted. And the video/website said this could be done in a weekend. HA! It took me 2 weeks! Devil's advocate-- I was pregnant, had a 2 yr old to chase around so couldn't work on it steadily, and pretty much doing it alone because my hubby was afraid he'd screw it up.

Beco Baby Carrier Gemini - Espresso,"I have a moby wrap and dr sears ring sling carrier. The beco is my favorite so far. The moby was great for my newborn but was a pain to put on. The ring sling was the easiest to put on but not too comfortable to wear. The beco is easy to put on and very comfortable to wear. It is perfect for my four month old. I love that my son can face out, although the most comfortable carrying position is him facing towards me. I also like the fit of this carrier. I'm not a small woman and this carrier fits great.",5,1
"Blueberry Solid Colors Diaper Laundry Bag, Meadow Green","I found this through a link in a review for another bag, and boy am I glad I did! I just wanted a storage bag for cloth diapers that didn't leak, could fit a large quantity of diapers and inserts, and had a drawstring closure. All the other options I saw were either too small or had so-so reviews , or weren't easily washable. Enter the blueberry bag!This is made from the same PUL material as the Bum Genius 4.0 pocket diapers we use. The washing instructions say to wash in warm water, but I've washed it in a few cycles of hot/cold (because I throw the bag in the wash with the diapers) and it holds up well. I hang the bag on the clothes rack with the diaper covers, and everything dries together. It doesn't take long for the bag to dry at all. Just make sure you empty out any remaining water into the washing machine. As this is made from the same leak-proof PUL material as the diapers, sometimes a little water gets trapped in there from the washing machine.Size wise, this bag is big. I've had 22 diapers and inserts in there at one time with PLENTY of room to spare. It maybe had filled up 3/4 of the way with the 22 diapers. But you don't want to put much more in because the bag does get heavy to carry if the inserts are damp/wet.The drawstring is elastic, so it closes securely. The only drawback is that the toggle on the drawstring doesn't slide very easily. It takes a little effort to close it, but that is a small price to pay, in my book, for an otherwise perfect storage option.I don't own a diaper pail, but the bag seems like it would easily fit over a pail and serve as a liner. I just keep the diapers in there without a pail. I hang it on the hook behind the bathroom door, but as mentioned before, as the bag fills up, it gets too heavy to remain hanging, so I end up taking it off the hook. I haven't had any issues with the smell of diapers. The drawstring, once closed, does a good job of containing any smells. That said, I do rinse the stool off the diapers, and rinse and wring out the inserts before putting them in there.I am very pleased with the bag. It performs very well and seems like it'll hold up well through the multitude of washes it'll go through.",5,1

"Turtlemeter, the Baby Bath Floating Turtle Toy and Bath Tub Thermometer",When I brought my son home from the hospital I was using a baby bath that already had a built in thermometer and it was very reassuring to know that I was giving him consistent warm baths everytime. Well a month ago I had to get a new one because I moved and couldn't take it with me. My new bath doesn't have a thermometer so I bought this turtle and I am soooo happy with it. Not only is it nice to know that I'm giving my baby the perfect temperature bath everytime but he loves looking at his turtle! I only leave the turtle in the bath long enough to take the temperature and then I take it out and set it to the side before I put my son in and I hope by doing this I'll be able to prolong it's lifespan as it's extremely useful.,5,1
"Turtlemeter, the Baby Bath Floating Turtle Toy and Bath Tub Thermometer","We got this Turtlemeter to have on hand when our 3 year old grandchild visits us. She loves taking a bath here and of course, she loves a ton of toys in the tub with her.The Turtlemeter is the perfect bath time toy and I love that it constantly displays the water temperature on it's easy-to-read LCD screen on the turtle's back (turtle's shell). The turtle floats around the tub and I can see the temperature really easily.Fabulous item at a super affordable price!",5,1

Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams White Crib Mattress,"I have nothing to compare this mattress to. Let me state that first and foremost.Pros: It is water/mess resistant. It is firm (as they say not to let babies sleep on mattresses that are too plush). It fits perfectly in my DaVinci crib.Being a first time mom, I was LOST in trying to pick out a mattress for my daughter. I wondered if it was too hard, or if the quality was ok. So I went with this one based on other reviews and comparing them to other mattresses online. I bought a (thin) mattress pad for it. But that is my neurosis more than anything. She seems to like it just fine though, as she has no trouble sleeping at night. So I will call that a win.",4,1

"Luvable Friends Flannel Receiving Blankets, Pink, 5 Pack","These receiving blankets are a good value for the price, considering you get five of them in one package. I like the combination/variety of patterns and colors.They're not high quality, but seem to be durable. I've washed them a few times and the stitching is holding up well at this point,as well as the softness. Stains come out with a spot/stain remover. I'd suggest a cold water wash though, to maintain the color.We just had a small 4+ lb baby, so these are the perfect size for swaddling and for use as burp rags.Will most likely be buying more in the future.",4,1
"Baby Aspen Snug As A Bug Snuggle Sack, 0-6 Months","This is my favorite baby sack.  It is made so well and the colors are true to the picture.  The area across the top is narrow for a 6mo. old baby but it does depend on how big the baby is.  The medium to small babies have no problem with the fit but the larger babies, the ones with high birth weights, it fits snug.  The quality is perfect and when she opened this gift there were a lot of comments on how cute it was, which I have to agree with totally.  Great seller!",4,1
"Skip Hop Versa Diaper Bag, Cream Links","After reading many reviews about poor workmanship I was hesitant to buy the bag until I saw it at Nordstrom. I loved the design and it is literally the perfect diaper bag. The one I purchased is cream links.The workmanship of the bag is fine. For $70, you aren't going to get coach quality materials. The materials they use are, of course, cheap... but still durable.What I especially like is that its got pockets for everything, cell phone, keys, bottles, nursing covers, etc.For those who want to have high-end materials, a more realistic price would be $200, like the price of designer bags. I do wish they made a high-end alternative for a higher price... in case someone wants to spend that kind of money.",4,1
"Skip Hop Versa Diaper Bag, Cream Links","I have gotten quite a few compliments on this bag. Probably because I take it everywhere with me. It has now become my purse as well, since I have taken over one of the front pockets. I am able to have different compartments for bottles, diapers, change of clothes, toys, etc. I love the zippers to make sure nothing falls out. The adjustable strap it also incredibly handy, and allows me to change up the bag depending on how I want to wear it or hang it. I always want more room in a bag, but this is the perfect size because if it were any larger I would just weigh it down with junk. Highly recommended.",5,1
Infantino Activity Triangle,"My 9 month old son enjoys this so much. There are different activities on each side which are all perfect for little hands. Several of the sides have spinning features, and these are his favorites.There are also small balls and &#34;corkscrew&#34; type spinners in each of the clear tubes that connect the blue and orange triangles. They make a  &#34;rainstick&#34; type noise when the toy is flipped. Its a pretty durable toy, and its easy to clean. I definitely recommend.",5,1
Infantino Activity Triangle,"This is one of my 8-month old son's favorite toys.  He is a very physical baby and mostly just likes to crawl, pull-up, ""stand"" and ""walk"".  He has no time for most toys.  This toy is one of the few exceptions.  I can almost always get him distracted for 5 minutes with it.  That might not sound like a lot, but it is to me.  I can repeatedly distract him with it and I haven't found anything else (besides the Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Ocean Orchestra Musical Toy) that can engage him the way this toy can.Besides being engaging, the other things I like about it:1.  Encourages development of fine motor skills - the little panels are perfect for baby fingers to practice pincer grasps to move beyond brute force ""rake and claw"" hand movements.2.  Helps develop sitting skills - When my son was learning to sit, I would prop him up with a Boppy behind him and this triangle in front of him and he would play that way for a few minutes while exercising his core.All-in-all, this is very worth the money and space in the toy chest.",5,1
Especially for Baby Bottle Cooler Bag with Eva Piping - Black,"We ordered this cooler to transport bottles to daycare. We could fit 4 large Dr. Brown's bottles (8oz) although it was a little bit tight, especially with the ice pack. My son is now down to 3 bottles/day and there is room for those plus 2 containers of food (the Gerber rectangular plastic containers stacked sideways next to the bottles). There is a pocket on the front and the back that we use for various papers, spare clothes (they just tuck in and hang out the side, but it's enough to let me carry the cooler and carseat into daycare without any problem) and a great pocket on the side that velcros - perfect for pacifiers or Tylenol. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is that the ice pack cracked after a couple of months, so we had to replace with a generic one. The interior is a nice silver reflective material that is insulated to keep contents cold. It's easy to wipe down and seems durable thus far. I wanted something that was easy to carry, wasn't bulky, looked somewhat stylish and would carry everything I needed. We ordered a couple of coolers and this was the winner by far.",4,1

"Charlie Banana 10 Reusable Organic Cotton Wipes,  (Pack of 2)","These are SO SO SO soft and perfect for little hands and faces! I purchased both these and the charlie banana double sided wipes. I LOVE these for her little hands and face after meals, etc. Its the perfect solution for me because I was using a LOT of either paper towels or disposable baby wipes (so not enviro-friendly! and not really baby friendly either!) I just folded them acordian style (so that one pops up after another like disposable wipes) and put them in an old cleaned out wipes container (the huggies ones seem to work best) and before we sit down to eat I just wet one and keep it with me while I feed her to wipe her up.also, the tag is so silky soft so it doesn't bother her :)",5,1

Britax Child Cup Holder,This cup holder attached and stayed attached perfectly for my seat which was listed as one of those compatible. (Advocate CS) My only complaint is more to the car seat design than the cup itself. The placement of the attachment isn't perfect. My average sized 2 year old is rear facing (so in the furthest recline option) and can just reach something from the cup holder if the cup or bottle is tall enough. I can't leave small snacks like grapes or crackers in it and expect him to be able to reach. So the holder is fine and hangs on tight but it's not a lot of use for babies or snacks. I'm keeping it as it will be more useful in time.,4,1
"ERGObaby Organic Baby Carrier, Desert Bloom","Very smart baby carrier! Switched to ERGO baby after our Babybjorn began to feel too small, and we needed something to carry on the back.

"Skip Hop Dunks Stacking Bath Toy, Blue, Green, Yellow",My 12 month old son LOVES these bath toys.  They are perfect to fill and rinse him with one while he plays with the others.  He loves to play with them when he's not even taking a bath.  They spin on the floor and he loves to spin them around.  I also like a bath toy that isn't squirty because of concern about them developing mold on the inside.,5,1

Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo,"Omg My Baby Adores This so much especially when she moves and its starts singing its just perfect for my baby she loves it and all the toys and colors call her attention its a perfect thing for baby's 5 months and up and at a good price bran new just like at any store,",5,1
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo,"I spent HOURS reading reviews for so many other jumperoos and with all the negative comments I heard about so many others, I was really hesitant to buy one at all.  But the Fisher Price ones seemed to have the least amount of problems and when they did, Fisher Price seemed keen to fix them.  So I knew I wanted a Fisher Price.  And since this is their newest model, I figured many of the problems with the other jumperoos would have been fixed.  As far as I can tell, they were for the most part.1.  the toys are not overwhelming.  they are simplistic and keep my daughter entertained endlessly.2.  The music is not overly annoying and when set on the low sound level, can't really even be heard once away from the music.3.  I love the bouncy music feature that makes noises and giggles, etc. when she bounces.  She hasn't really caught on yet, but it keeps her entertained.4.  The red bird came with some paint scrapes on her face but I tried to scratch at them with my finger nail and nothing came off, so I wasn't worried about paint chips like some of the other jumpers had.5.  The colors are great, but not overwhelming.  They are perfect for her and keep her attention.6.  The springs are fabric covered and so far have held up through LOTS of enthusiastic jumping.7.  The base seems really stable.  When she bounces the arms barely move and the base not at all.8.  My only complaint - the leaves from which the rhino and monkey hang are supposed to SNAP in but I couldn't get them to and she is able, when she pulls hard enough, to pull the leaves actually out of the arms and get to the toys that way.  I wish they had a better locking mechanism so they couldn't do this.9.  One other complaint - the hanging rhino and monkey catch her interest and she tries to pull at them but can't really hold on to them.  I almost wish they were on a stretchier cord so she could get to them when she wants to.10.  Ironically, her favorite toy is the plain teether.  She spends more time with that than any other.  It is nice that it has a teether on it so she can have one toy that is sort of relaxing and doesn't make noise etc. if she ever just needs a break.11.  There is a small tray for snacks - some of the other reviews thought this was pointless and took up too much room, enough room for another toy instead.  But this tray is very small and doesn't keep any other toys from being attached.  I am glad there are no other toys on this tray because then I think it would be overwhelming.All in all, I love this jumper.  We haven't had any problems after one month.  Certainly no issues like so many of the other jumpers have.  She stays endlessly entertained and would stay in her jumper all day if I were to let her.  If any of the Fisher Price issues come up I will update my review, but for the tme being, we love it and have had no problems!",5,1
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair,I love this seat soooo much better than the crappy cheap one my mom bought him at Walmart. its perfect!,5,1
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","This is a great product and over all I am extremely happy with it.  The material is very soft our baby loves it.  I am not even kidding when I say if we put her in there she will go right to sleep.  It is warm and cozy for the baby.  The music plays loud and there is a pretty good variety of noises such as music or nature sounds.  The songs play for a long time and after it goes through all of them it stops.  The swing has good power in terms of moving back and forth.  The first setting is actually really fast for infants, but all we did was put a heavier blanket over the baby and it slowed it down to a perfect speed.  I am very happy with the speed power.  The one downfall about this product is that it only has on setting in terms of reclining.  Many other swings have the ability to sit up straight so they can have snack when they get a bit older, but this one constantly sits between laying down and sitting.  I was a little bummed to find out there are no options for sitting up straight or laying down.  The swing takes up a little more space than others but is very stable when swinging.  If you are still unsure I would go to a store and look at them in person that is the only way to tell which one is for you.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","This is PERFECT. My daughter loves it, the music/mobile goes just long enough for her to go to sleep and not drive me crazy, it has both battery and wall plug capability, and it has no problem swinging my daughter now that she's over 15 lbs. like a lot of other swings do. Definitely worth the money!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","She loves it so much, in fact, that she slept in it for the first 3 1/2 months of her life. A warning to other parents... don't let them get use to sleeping in this! We are now having issues with her head being pretty flat on one side and it is from her sleeping on the thin padding on this swing. That is of course my fault however and not the fault of the swing. She is so attached that we are having a hard time getting her to now sleep in her crib to correct the problem. She is also too big for this swing now at 4 months and 13 lbs and honestly has been for awhile. With that being said, this swing is perfect for settling down small babies. She has always been so happy in the swing and she LOVES the hanging birds! We don't use the music and sounds (birds, water) often because she didn't seem interested in it. We have not had any problems with the motor. It actually swings a little too fast for my comfort level. We have never taken it off of the first setting.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","After 6 months of constant use the motor died on our swing so basically meaning it wouldn't swing anymore. The sounds and mobile still worked perfectly. I contacted Fisher-Price easily through their website and used their messaging system to ""talk"" to a representative. She quickly helped me locate the model and serial number and I received a new motor (basically the entire top portion/mobile area) within a week. This swing is pricy as most swings are but I found Amazon had the lowest price when I bought this back in June. My baby slept in this swing until she was 6 months and when the motor died we painstakingly moved her to her crib, so I guess it was all a blessing in disguise.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","I can't find a thing wrong with this swing, it is great. My daughter was born at 5.8 lbs and she fits in it wonderfully. I love how it will recline to a pretty well flat position for her, so I don't have to worry about the length of time she is in it.(Newborns and especially babies that small need to lay flat rather than inclined for too long cause their head will fall forward and could close their airways.)Since she was so small the swing speed setting even on the lowest was too fast for her, but that wasn't an issue. All we had to do was lay a blanket over her and let it drag on the floor, it slows it down just enough. The fabric is so lush and soft she absolutely loves it and so do I. She would lay there in it content all day if I would let her. They don't specify whether you can let you baby sleep in it or not, probably for liability sake, however the way I figure it, if the baby is laying flat on its back (and it is still young enough to not wiggle and turn its head everywhere) I can't see the harm in it. I don't let her sleep in it during the night, but during the day I don't have any problems with it at all. The main reason I picked this swing over a few other options that Fisher Price has available right now is two things. It is better than the Fisher Price Starlight Papasan Cradle Swing because it has a 5 point harness instead of a 3 point. If you read the reviews on the other one, this is something a lot of people bring up as an issue. I want the safest thing I can get for my baby, 5 point is best! And it is better than the Fisher Price My Little Lamb Cradle n Swing because it is able to plug into the wall outlet which the other will not do. It is a little more expensive than those, but for those two things, it is well worth it I think. It doesn't have a baby tray but that was fine for me, I rather not have one anyways. My babies never really use those things, they just collect grime to have to clean off, and they are a pain to have to work to get your baby in and out around. I like the mirror dome and the mobile over the other swings as well, I think they seem more practical for a baby. It was super easy to put together, I did it all by myself in about 20 minutes or so. Their are a ton of other features I could comment on but I wont. I think I mentioned most of the important things. Basically for me and my babies needs, it is perfect so far.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","My sister just gave birth to a boy and he sometimes cries for no reason. We put him on this swing and he is asleep right away.I have searched $250 Mamaroo swing because it looks cool and modern, but this swing works perfectly fine with our family.Highly Highly recommend it.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","This swing has helped me out so many times when my baby wanted to sleep.  It was perfect during his colicky times.  I also loved how it plugged in.  We use the swing at least once a day.  The only thing I would do to make product better is the pillow does not detach for cleaning purposes.  You have to take the whole part off when washing.  Overall, I love the swing. He is almost 6 months now and I can see that it is getting a little too small for him.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","I needed to find something for my newborn son to sleep in as I didn't want to put him in his big crib yet. I saw this at a local store and it is adorable, plush and all sorts of sounds, etc. I ended up ordering it from Amazon as it was much cheaper than in the store. Everything works perfect, but holy cow the motor that runs the cradle swing is LOUD, not a low hum or something white noise-ish, but obnoxiously noisy. I put the Snugabunny in our bedroom near my bed and I can't sleep with the swing on! It also swings a little fast (even on the lowest setting) for my newborn. On the positive side, the mobile is super cute and the music is nice also. My little guy does sleep in it pretty well, just not with the swing going. I probably would have still purchased it again, but if you're looking for something for baby to sleep in and you're sensitive to sound, this thing will drive you crazy! During the day it's no big deal though.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny",This is a great swing. Easy to use and baby loves it. She loves looking at herself in the mirror above her head and the spinning toys. It didn't take long to put together. I did it all by myself less than a week after my c-section. Only issue is some of the directions are a little confusing so I recommend looking at the box while putting it together. Only other thing that was difficult was removing the screws for the batteries. I gave up after a few mins and have just plugged it into the wall and will let my husband do it later. It seems strudy as my 40 pound three year old decided to sit in it and it is still perfectly functional. Overall I love it and hopefully it will hold up really well. I would recommend it.,5,1
"Curtain Critters Plush Jungle Safari Elephant and Lion Curtain Tieback, Car Seat, Stroller, Crib Toys Collector Set",I had to send this for my friends baby.

The box come with an adorable saying, along the lines of ""when you're a twin sharing is a must, but somethings aren't meant to be shared""... perfect gift for anyone expecting twins!",5,1
Skip Hop Treetop Friends Activity Gym,We've tried a few but seems my daughter has chosen a favourite!  This product has generously sized toys with multiple interest points and my baby spends around 20 min on it about 3 times a day.  The pillow is perfect for little heads.  Love it!!j,5,1
Skip Hop Treetop Friends Night and Day Discovery Toy,"Just as adorable as shown in picture, maybe even more so. This item arrived a day early and was in perfect condition. Will make a great gift for christmas, I think my niece will just love it!",5,1

Kidsline Dotty 6 Piece Crib Set,"This crib set is exactly what i was looking for and believe me i looked hard. I probably looked at over 100! I wanted my baby girl to have the perfect blend of cute, colorful and fun while also being good quality. This crib set exceeded my expectations and is even nicer in person than in the pictures! and each time i have washed it the colors and fabrics are just like when i first opened the package. maybe even better actually, because they have gotten softer!",5,1
"John Deere Pickles 21X42&quot; John Deer Nap Mat, Down On The Farm",Our son uses this at Mothers Day Out and it is perfect. Nice padding for a good price and it is really cute.,4,1
"Tadpoles 16 Sq Ft Pawprint Playmat Set, Brown",we love this mat... it is adorable and we love anything bear themed. the only downside is that my baby is only six months now (below the recommended age for this item) and knows how to pull it apart very quickly...and it is a lot of pieces...each paw is five separate pieces. there should be no problem with this when he's older though hopefully :) ...for now we have it covered with a cloth mat so he can't get to it. would be perfect for an older baby/child.,4,1
"Bamboobies 2 Pair Ultra-Thin Regular Nursing Pads, Pale Pink","I'm a second time mommy, and I love this product.  I have 5 pairs of the overnight and 9 of the day time, and I think that is about the perfect amount.  My baby is just over 2 weeks so I'm in the over-producing / leaking stage and the bamboobies are soft and comfortable!",5,1

"Emily Green 4&quot;X3&quot; Tumbler, Mix It Up","I have 4 complete sets of Emily Green dinnerware -- bowl, plate, cup, and place mat -- in Sunshine Safari, Mix It Up, Up Above the World, and Dump It. For the past couple of years, they've been my favorite dinnerware for my 3.5-year-old, and I can't wait for my 15-month-old to get big enough to use them too! The artwork is quirky and adorable, but not too cutesy -- my family loves the designs. The dinnerware is also a big hit with my son's little buddies whenever they are over.The cups are great -- perfect size, nice shape that is easy to grip and stable on surfaces, sturdy (ours have been dropped many, many times), and fun to use.  Absolutely no complaints.  They are a good starter cup for the baby too.  Note that when stacking, each cup only fits about halfway inside the next.Amazon had these for the best price, and they definitely are worth the investment so far. Our oldest set is over 2 years old and the color is just as beautiful as our newest set. My only fear is that Emily Green will continue to come out with more fantastic designs and I will have to keep adding to our collection (much to my husband's chagrin!).",5,1
"Safety 1st Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat, Lamont","My daughter was 12 months old when she grew out of her infant car seat. This seat came fast and I like the quality, and she loves it. My only complaint is that if you are trying to follow the recommendation of keeping your kid rear facing until they are 2 then this seat is almost impossible to install correctly rear facing! We have a Toyota 4runner with lots of space and I actually ended up taking it to the local police department to have it professionally installed! You see, my husband and I spent forever trying to secure it, we watched the videos, read the instructions, used a towel, EVERYTHING, but it still would wiggle more then 1 inch at the base. I am pretty paranoid with it being installed correctly, so maybe most people wouldn't care that it would wiggle more then 1 inch, but we could seriously slide it back and forth way too much. Plus, when we did get it somewhat tight enough the recline wasn't right so her head would flop forward when she fell sleep in the car. I seriously had to reach back and hold her head up while she slept the whole 25 minutes home!The certified person at he police department spent 30 minutes installing it into my car. It looked like she was in a wrestling match, she was seriously bouncing on it and using all of her body weight and had to try it about 6 times before she got it right.  Well, my problem is now that it is installed perfectly I obviously don't want to take it out, but my mother-n-law watches her once a week...so the certified car seat person recommended buying a really cheap (but safe) car seat for grandma's car...so it looks like I am going to go buy a $50 car seat from Wal-Mart. I just keep telling myself that once we can  turn it around all these problems disappear, but wow it may be a long year. I may sound extreme, but I am willing to do whatever it takes for her to be safe in her car seat, getting in a bad accident is my biggest fear!",4,1
"Emily Green 6&quot; Bowl, Sunshine Safari","I have 4 complete sets of Emily Green dinnerware -- bowl, plate, cup, and place mat -- in Sunshine Safari, Mix It Up, Up Above the World, and Dump It.  For the past couple of years, they've been my favorite dinnerware for my 3.5-year-old, and I can't wait for my 15-month-old to get big enough to use them too!  The artwork is quirky and adorable, but not too cutesy -- my family loves the designs.  The dinnerware is also a big hit with my son's little buddies whenever they are over.The bowl is the perfect size and shape for a toddler.  We use it for soup, cereal, oatmeal, rice, etc.  It holds a good amount, but is wide (good for food cooling off) and a little low (more stable base, plus easier for a kid to manage).  My son likes seeing the design peek through as he eats his food.  The only downside is that it's not microwaveable (although this hasn't proven to be a problem for us).  Another thing to keep in mind is that they only partially stack on top of each other, so a stack of 5+ or so might be a little wobbly (4 is fine though, ha ha!).Amazon had these for the best price, and they definitely are worth the investment so far.  Our oldest set is over 2 years old and the color is just as beautiful as our newest set.  My only fear is that Emily Green will continue to come out with more fantastic designs and I will have to keep adding to our collection (much to my husband's chagrin!).",5,1
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Elephant",I got this for my 1 year old. It's perfect. So many night lights light up the room and make it too bright. This is perfect. It's a subtle glow. But I do wish one of the color options was white. I like the blue and green ones but not a fan of the red or the rainbow,4,1
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Elephant","We had a twilight turtle, but it shuts off after a certain amount of time. Our 20month old son was waking up at 2 or 3am freaking out in the dark. We needed something to stay on all night. Plug in night lights were just ""begging"" for him to unplug and play with. This is the perfect solution. My son sleeps from 7pm-7am and it remains on the whole time, never gets hot. He sleeps with it in his bed.",5,1
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Bear","Roughly 9 months ago, we had a violent, windy storm that caused our front door to shriek in the wind. From that night on, our 2 and 1/2 year was absolutely terrified at night. She had never had any trouble going to sleep before, but after that she was up out of bed a half dozen times or more each night, visibly frightened of the dark.We tried keeping the overhead light on, and letting a radio play, but both only provided temporary relief. I also didn't want her to sleep with her room completely illuminated at night. Enter the KinderGlo. We knew she needed a better night light - one that made her feel like she wasn't in the dark at all, but I didn't want to light her entire room. A night light she could hold in her hands seemed like the perfect solution.The first night or two, we used the rotating light function, because we thought it would fascinate her. And it did. But after that, we worried it was too distracting, and she was staying up later than we wanted. So we began to ask her what color she wanted, and then we'd set the color. At first she preferred green, but the last few months she's always chosen red. Other reviewers are right about some colors being brighter than others. Red is nice and soft. I don't believe she has gotten out of bed once since we purchased it.The only con can also be viewed as a pro. The bear is very easy for the child to turn off and on, and to change the color. The only reason this is a con is because we would choose a color, bypass the 30 minute timer, and then after my daughter went to bed, she'd decide to change the color again. When she changed the color, the 30 minute timer would be reset, which meant the bear would be off 30 minutes later, and she would wake up in the middle of the night in a dark room crying hysterically. After we explained several times that changing the color made the bear turn off (it would be very difficult for a small child to hold the button long enough to bypass the timer again) she seemed to understand and stopped messing with the color setting.Now for why this product doesn't have five stars. After reading all the reviews, I expected the bear to stop charging, or the light to stop working. After all, we've bypassed the 30 minute setting each and every night, which means the bear has run all night, every night for 8 straight months. Which is why I was days away from writing a glowing review. I was certain that if the bear was still working after 8 months, it would continue to work. Well - it likely still works, but the light mechanism inside has detached completely, meaning we can't turn it on to find out. My daughter has faithfully placed it back in the charger each morning since we go it, and we've never allowed her to play with it, but it has fallen out of her bed a handful of times (as anything in a child's bed would do from time to time). It has never been mistreated in any way, but a few of these short falls must have been enough to dislodge the light from inside. We currently have a request for a replacement from KinderGlo, as we are still inside the year warranty. I will update this review with fewer stars if we have difficulty receiving a replacement.",4,1
"Dreambaby Stroller Fan, White/Blue",The blades are made of soft foam so they are perfect for use around kids. I have one on my baby's stroller and one on the back seat of the car. Just the right amount of breeze.,5,1
Baby snuggle buddy (Minnie),"~~  I have been looking for months for a few back-ups of this particular Minnie Mouse security blanket/toy.  There are many different styles out there (some authentic & some fake and made to look like the originals--beware!).  My grandaughter became attached to this particular one, which was a hand-me-down from a friend which was never used,  but ther were no tags attached.  There is no place this little girl will go, unless she has her minnie......we desperately would sneek minnie out of bed at night just to wash it.  It was to my delight that we found this item on amazon,  and I immediately orderd two without hesitating.  Now we have a back up and one as a replacement if we ever loose one.  The product was NWT attached and in plastic.  Don't hesitate to buy this if your little girl or guy is attached to one, it is the perfect size to carry for little ones, plus it doesn't take up a lot of room for mom & dad to pack on small or large trips. Very happy with my purchase........Thank You!!",5,1

"Bummis Tots Bots Bamboozle Stretch Diaper, Size 2 (9-35 Pounds)","if I could have my bad sheets made in this lovely fabric I would. the diaper is amazingly soft, absorbant and cute. the only dislike is the velcro. its rubs bad and its cuts the skin of your child. if they can make the velcro skinnier or just use snaps, it would be perfect",4,1
Joovy Scooter Single Stroller Greenie,"This was a gift purchased from our registry.  We received it this week, and are very happy so far.  The greenie is a great lime green.  It was easy to put together.  It rolls really smoothly and seems easy to guide.  The hood is huge, as is the basket underneath, I can see fitting a ton of stuff in there.  I can pick it up with one arm, even though at first I thought it was a little heavy taking it out of the box.  The Graco Snugride fits perfectly as advertised, although it seems that you can't use the stroller's hood with it.My only complaint upon receipt is that the cup holder is not supposed to be used for hot beverages - guess I'll have to figure out something else for my latte!",4,1
"Vital Baby Press 'n' Pop Mini Freezer Pots, Orange, 1 Ounce, 8 Pack","I use these little guys to freeze spicy garden produce that I would want in small quantities: hot peppers, roasted garlic, hot onions, etc.  They are perfect.  They are not stable when stacked, but just put them in a basket or larger container.",5,1
"Vital Baby Press 'n' Pop Mini Freezer Pots, Orange, 1 Ounce, 8 Pack","I love these little freezer pots!  They make freezing baby food very easy.  They are stackable, and they save a ton of space by being able to put them in the freezer door.  I would definitely recommend these to any parent planning on making their own baby food.  When my puree is frozen, I simply pop the cubes into a freezer bag.  To defrost my food, I put 1 cube into a container that has a lid, then I put the closed container in the fridge over night.  I ordered 2 orders of these (16 freezer pots), and that seems to be the perfect amount.",5,1
"Vital Baby First Stainless Steel Cutlery Set, Blue",My daughter is 22 months old and has been using this set for a few months.  She and I love this set.  She has been using this stainless steel set like a pro.  This fits her hands perfectly and is helping her perfect her eating skills.  She is also trying to use her knife as well.,5,1
"Vital Baby Unbelievabowl Set, Orange",This works perfectly on our silestone counter. My husband is impressed too. My little one uses it and enjoys having a meal with us. Recommended!,5,1
"Vital Baby Toddler Straw Cup, Orange, 10 Ounce","My daughter has been very picky about what she drinks out of since she was born. We bought several different types of sippy cups and she just couldn't get the hang of having to tip the cup back so we decided to try a straw cup. After a couple different types and lots of research, we tried one of these and SHE LOVES IT! I love that it has the volume measurements on the outside so we can monitor her fluid intake and that it doesn't leak (unless she throws it). Other straw cups we have tried leave her coughing and choking because she gets too much water at once but these are perfect and she rarely coughs after drinking. It is not too difficult for her to suck through the straw. Its easy to clean, you just need a small brush. I bought one of each color and she will be able to use these for a long time. The protective cap comes off too, which we leave off unless we are going somewhere. 100% satisfied with this cup!",5,1
"SwaddleDesigns zzZipMe Sack with 2-Way Zipper, Organic Cotton Flannel Wearable Blanket, Dots and Hearts in Pastel Pink 6-12 Months",Perfect for my 6 and now 8 month old baby girl!  Love she isn't breathing flame retardants all night :),5,1

GrowingUpGreen Bamboo Booster Seat,"We were looking into switching out 2 year old from a highchair to a booster seat. We are also trying to eliminate the amount of plastic products we buy. Then I found THIS. I love bamboo products. This chair is not only green, but also nice to look at. I am glad we got this and not some bulky, primary colored plastic piece of junk displaying disney princesses.  My daughter weighs about 24lbs, the seat is perfect size with room for her to grow. The seat is not only aesthetically pleasing, it is also practical and very easy to clean. I am very pleased with my purchase...I will definitely be recommending this product to a friend.",5,1
Pink and Green Olivia Girls Boutique Toddler Bedding 5 pc set by Sweet Jojo Designs,"I am absolutely in love with this set.  My toddler loves frogs, so we redecorated her room with a frog theme this year for Christmas, and this set complements that perfectly.  We have a crib that converts to a toddler bed, and this set fits it just fine.The comforter is a light and not too thick, which is perfect for the warm weather where we live.  Some people may expect the comforter to be thicker, so just be warned when you buy it.  If you need something more, there's a nice fluffy throw blanket in this set, as well.  But for us, this is absolutely perfect.",5,1
Pink and Green Olivia Accent Floor Rug by Sweet Jojo Designs,this rug is awesome. it goes perfectly with the rest of the jojo olivia collection. great quality and is very soft. so glad i did her nursery in this pattern!,5,1
"Keekaroo Height Right High Chair, Infant Insert and Tray Combo, Natural/Cherry",I was a little worried after some of the reviews but I have a couple friends who have had one for awhile and love them. The chair is wonderful it's strong and love how it grows with the child. I wish I would have got it after my first child was born! My daughter is 18 months and the infant insert made her sit up a little to high putting the tray on her lower lap. We took the infant insert out and she fits perfect! I will agree that the food tray is a little skinny but luckily my plates fit on it. As far as the reviews about your kid possible falling when you take the tray off. If they followed the directions and installed everything correctly there is no possible way your child can fall out. Also the review about the foot pad falling out. No possible way! You have to loosen the screws in order to adjust the seat and the foot rest. Then you just tighten them back up! Great chair! Will recommend to friends!,4,1
"Keekaroo Height Right High Chair, Infant Insert and Tray Combo, Natural/Cherry","I bought my first of these chairs when my now 2 1/2 year old was 6 months old. He is still using it and I imagine will be for some time to come.I have another baby now who is 6 months old and in need of a highchair of his own. I considered giving him his older brothers and moving my older boy into something else. But after some consideration the older boy does so darn well in this chair still that I didn't want to take it away from him.So I'm purchasing my second as we speak. Bought the first here on amazon but just bought the second from ""The Furniture Store"" as they currently have the best price on the internet.A few things that you might find helpful....When I purchased the first I also got the infant seat.... A must. But when I got the infant seat and installed it I felt like I still needed something more behind his back instead of just the hard wooden back. So I also purchased the toddler flat seat and back cushion combo. I took the back cushion and used it in combination with the infant seat and it was beyond perfect! In fact that is how the chair remained configured until my boy was a little over two. He took the back cushion off when he was about two as he found it more comfortable without it now that he was bigger.Just yesterday (he is now 2 years 7 months old) I removed the infant seat and installed the flat cushion toddler seat. So he is now sitting in the chair with just the flat cushion seat and no back cushion. He was very pleased with the new configuration. I'm ok not having the back cushion on his chair as he climbs up into the chair himself and if he grabs the back cushion while climbing up the cushion will pull out of the chair and he will fly cushion in hand the the floor.I must admit I partially delayed the use of the flat toddler seat because I didn't realize that you could still use the seat belt with it and I still like to have him buckled in. But to my surprise you can still use the seatbelt with the toddler flat seat!So now I will take the back cushion and infant seat from the first chair and will install them on the new one coming for my 6 month old.This chair has been great! It's easy to clean, very sturdy, looks like a nice piece of furniture and not another plastic hunk of kid crap like we all probably have a ton of.  I use little plastic kid plates on it so the tray size that others have complained about is not a problem as I wouldn't want a bigger plate anyway. If you can get your kid to eat enough food to fill a big plate that's great but I'm lucky if mine will eat off a 5inch one at all.  So yes you must use two hands to get the tray off but I don't find that to be an issue. I'd say this is a pretty darn close to perfect chair.If I have a third kiddo I most likely will have a third Keekaroo!Update....Don't try to order from the furniture store.  I just purchased my second chair from Amazon after all as my order with ""The Furniture Store"" fell through. I guess the cost was too good to be true from them. Even though there were some stores selling at maby a $10 discount from amazons price I trust amazon and they always do right by me so they got my order in the end.",5,1
"Keekaroo Height Right Kids High Chair with Comfort Cushions, Natural/Lilac",I received this chair earlier than expected. It was very easy to assemble.This chair has a very unique design and will adjust asmy great grandchild grows. This is an amazing piece of furniture. It can be utilized from infancy to adulthood with a few minoradjustments from time to time.I consider it to be the perfect chair.,5,1

Tiddliwinks Batik Butterfly Fitted Print Crib Sheet - Purple,"I purchased this sheet because my child moved to a preschool room that had larger cots.  Tiddliwinks was the only brand-name that fit the dimensions of the preschool cots.  The quality of the product is the same that you would find with Gerber sheets.  I have washed the sheet over 5 times and do not see fading or shrinkage!  You pay more for this type of sheet, but for my purpose it was perfect.The quality of the sheet is better than what appears in the thumbnail view of the product.  I was very satisfied with the quality and workmanship when I received this product in the mail.Target.com is the only other place I found that carried this sheet and at comparable pricing.  I purchased though amazon because I have a prime account, and you cannot beat free shipping!I recommend this product.",5,1

"Boppy Tummy Play Pad, Stripe A Dot","I got this for my little niece who is as cute as a button.  Not having had a baby in the family before we are all a little bit beside ourselves - and imagine what a great aunt I am to have presented this snazzy thing.  Perfect for a little tummy time, or for setting little ones on the grandparents expensive sofa in case of leaks.  The little hook on toys are wonderful to keep her attention and the colors are great.  Apparently her favorite toy is the little flower that came with this thing.  Now that she is able to grab and move things of her own accord this flower is constantly getting gnawed on.  When I have a child of my own this will for sure be a purchase I make.  Small, portable, easy to clean, brightly colored, and not over priced.  I recommend it as a baby shower gift for sure!",5,1
"Philips AVENT Soothie Pacifier, 0-3 Months, 2-Pack, Pink/Purple",This is the same brand used by the hospital where our children were born.  Perfect.  This is exactly what we wanted in lovely feminine colors,5,1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Healthy Care High Chair,We have had this high chair for two kids now and it has held up perfectly.The Good:- I love the toy that fits onto the tray. Baby cannot knock it off or play the ""I drop it and laugh while Mommy picks it up"" game.- I love that the toy is removable when its time to feed.- The wheels roll smoothly and no problems of them getting stuck- The pattern is soooo cute- The seat is very easily adjusted from far back recline to up close to the tray. One hand adjustment too! That is a bonus!- Very easy to put together- Plastic vinyl very easy to keep clean and very few areas that food can get into that cannot just be wipes away.- The seat belt... although it was not easy for us to install... maybe we did it wrong? The seat belt is a three point harness.- Easy storage since it folds up- Height adjustable and not by small degrees... it goes almost all the way down to the floor so you can sit at the couch if you wanted to feed baby. Pretty handy when you are in my situation where you are breastfeeding while spoon feeding your 15 month old- Tray is dishwasher safe and fits our small dishwasher just fine- The added head support for early usersNot so Good:- The wheels were so easy to lock that every time we moved the chair one would get locked by accident.- The seatbelt is great for safety but they are a pain to get baby in and out.. they are 3 point harness straps.,5,1
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory",I've tried other kinds of these and most are pretty expensive. This one is the cheapest I think and is super soft and cozy for my infant baby. The car seat buckles fit perfectly around it. It's nice to use in a crib too.,5,1
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","I didn't know that these things existed with my last baby, so I was using rolled up baby blankets in the car seat to keep my baby in place, so when I saw these at amazon, I thought I would give it a try, and am glad I did. I works perfect, I recommend it to everynew mother.",5,1
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","Our daughter was not exceptionally small when she was born, 7lbs 4oz, but our stroller wasn't really made for newborns.  AND we had a bouncy seat that was a great spot to put her, but her head would keep falling over.  SO my husband found this!  Boy do we love it!  The headpiece is not connected to the rest, which makes it perfect to remove and use with other items AND for ever growing babies.  We use the head part in the bouncy seat and the whole thing in the stroller.  Not only does it help with head positioning, but it provides extra comfort and warmth and security.  PRICELESS!!!",5,1
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","So glad we purchased this Snuzzler! Would recommend to anyone and everyone. Soft, but durable, a nice neutral color to match any theme. Works perfect for any newborn car seat.",5,1
"Harmony Kids Round Back Glider, Blue Chenille",WE PUT THIS CHAIR IN OUR NURSERY AND IT IS PERFECT!  ITS LIKE SITTING ON A DOWN COMFORTER!  I WILL BE SLEEPING IN THIS CHAIR COMFORTABLY WHEN THIS BABY ARRIVES!,5,1
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink","This chair is the perfect size for my 18 month old. the chair is nice and soft and appears to be very durable. She likes to sit in it and rub the soft fabric on the chair. It says some assembly required, I expected to have to attach arms and the back, but you only need to screw the rockers on to the bottom of the chair. AWESOME! It's low enough and wide enough that she can crawl over it and it does not tip.  my only suggestion would be that the chair could be a bit heavier so that kids wont be able to push it around or pick it up on their own. I like the several different color choices and the price can't be beat. (I found the same chair on other sites for 20 to 30 dollars more than on Amazon) I plan to buy more of these when we make a playroom for her.  Love it!",4,1
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink",We purchased this for Christmas. My son was 19 months old. It was perfect. He sits in it while watching his videos. He is almost 2 now and he still loves his seat. Worth every penny,5,1
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink","After reading some of the reviews, I almost didn't take a chance on this chair! I am so glad I did. It is sturdy, attractive, and cleans up very easily when I wipe the arms and seat down after my grandson, age two,  has a snack in the chair. I am so pleased with it! We did not put the rockers on...our choice as we didn't want it to rock...and it is perfect. It also helps keep little ones sitting back away from the TV screen. Love it!!!!",5,1
"Itzy Ritzy WBL8024 Travel Happens Sealed Wet Bag, Avocado Damask, Large, Travel Happens, Large",This is a great wet bag. Many different functions from cloth diapers to swimsuits to soiled clothes! Perfect size to throw in your diaper bag. I also bought the snack happened pouch to hold my cloth wipes!,5,1
"Hold-On Handles Bizzy Bugs Spare Handle Unit, Ladybug","We got our first Hold-On Handle because it seemed so useful, and we were expecting our 2nd child. Honestly, we didn't use it for anything until we started traveling with both kids. My older one was 3, and we had a stroller for the baby. It was perfect for walking through crowded airports. I just hooked it onto the stroller, and instead of holding my hand, he just held onto this. I didn't have to worry about him walking too far away from me, and I didn't have to constantly say &#34;stay close to me&#34; while walking through the airport. Lifesaver when you have your hands full!I like that it is in 2 pieces so you could potentially connect more than one handle to the same caribeaner. We ended up losing the handle on one trip (got lost when we gate-checked our stroller and left it attached), so I was able to just order the handle again to save money. Next time I will just make sure I put the handle in my carry on bag before gate checking the stroller.",5,1
"Hold-On Handles Bizzy Bugs Single Handle Set, Butterfly",I love this idea and it worked perfectly until the clip broke the first day - the spring popped out.  now i have to strapped to the stroller and it works but have to call and complain that it broke so easily.UPDATE: i contacted the manufacturer and they responded immediately with shipping out a replacement product! Great response!,4,1
Fisher-Price Little Superstar Step N' Play Piano,"It's a fun toy for little babies and big babies!  A perfect grow with me toy and fun too. My daughter loves the songs. When we're away from it, I sing the songs to her and she loves it!",5,1
"Disney Rocking Chair, Cars Drift",This chair arrived in perfect condition.  My 4yr. old grandson was delighted with it.  He and his brother each have their own different ""cars"" rockers (see my review on the Disney Blue and Red rocker).,5,1
KidCo GoPod Portable Activity Seat - Pistachio,Our five month old at 97% for size was too small for the opening and needed towels folded around him...his two year old nephew climbed in and fit perfectly but was obviously too old and mobile to use.  I would suggest making the opening a little smaller and lowering the lowest setting so younger babies do no cause the material to collapse downward and inward.  Good design for quick folding and travel...I wish it was not made in China.,4,1
KidCo GoPod Portable Activity Seat - Pistachio,"Love the Go-pod. It's awesome. I wish that I had one when my older children were younger. I use it with my 7 month old son. I thought it would come in handy mostly for camping but find myself using it all the time. Tonight, we went out to dinner and sat outside and I was able to set it up next to the table. The little guy was perfectly happy the entire meal. I also bring it to the park with me and set the baby up in it so I can keep an eye on him while helping my 2 year old. I love baby gear and I would say this is a MUST BUY!",5,1
KidCo GoPod Portable Activity Seat - Pistachio,"Perfect for travel for my 6 month old! Easy to pack up and carry, great for feeding or playing. Baby enjoys being in it.",5,1
KidCo GoPod Portable Activity Seat - Pistachio,Perfect gift for the family on the go or a family who is outside a lot.  Makes a great baby gift.,5,1
KidCo GoPod Portable Activity Seat - Pistachio,We purchased this to take on a trip for our 6 month old. It folds up so compact that it makes it perfect to carry where ever you think you might need it. We even use it at home now for an upstairs entertainer!,5,1
"Skip Hop Bento Diaper Tote Bag, Black","Summary of below: It's a great bag that fits a huge amount of items.  I highly recommend it!I had theSkip Hop Studio Diaper Bag Tote Bag, Pewter Dotfor 5 months, but I found it just didn't have the storage I needed.  I could never find my diapers and wipes fast enough, nor was the ""Mommy"" section of the purse large enough.  However, since it was such a well-made, stylish bag, I decided to go with another SkipHop bag.The Bento Diaper Tote has so much going for it!  I've had it for 2 months, but I'm sorry I didn't get it sooner!1. The straps are all long enough to fit over a shoulder, and the long strap allows you to carry the bag messenger style for a more hands-free experience.2. The bottle pockets are huge.  I've never had the problem the other reviewers mentioned about the bag not allowing items to go to the bottom.  I actually use the included ice packet in the pocket with my bottles to keep them cold.3. The bottom section that holds the food cooler/ice packet is amazing!  My daughter is only 7 months old, so we don't really need the cooler feature yet.  Instead, I keep all my diapering needs down there so they are easy to get to.  It fits 6 disposable diapers, 2 cloth diapers, 1 wet wipes travel case, 1 small tube ofBoudreaux's Butt Paste, Diaper Rash Ointment, Tube 4 oz (113 g), a wetbag dispenser, and an extra onsie.  Yeah - it's both large and well-planned.  By keeping something in the lower pocket, the bag never falls over like other reviewers mentioned.4. There are 3 pockets I use as ""Mommy"" pockets.  In the large lower one on the middle-front of the bag I keep all my makeup, chapsticks, kleenexes, etc...  The pocket just above it is small and semi-hidden, so I keep my car keys and cell phone in there.  Then there is a fairly large pocket just in front of the main compartment of the diaper bag where I keep my ""big"" wallet (hold my checkbook, coupons, etc...).  It has room for a lot more, but I like to keep that pocket zipped unless I need it so I don't put anything else in there.5. The main compartment is huge and well organized.  It has 7 little elasticized pockets around it with an open center space.  Since the bag has the lower zip out compartment, it's not so deep you can't access anything.  Also, since the rest of the bag is so well organized, I don't have to carry a lot in here.  Just a feeding spoon, a few toys, easy-grab burp rag, camera, wallet, sunbonnet and sunglasses, my sunglasses, etc...  When I want to, I stick my laptop in the middle section and it fits perfectly!6. The bag is so well-styled!  I have the olive green color, and military details have been ""in"" for while now.  I have a pretty neutral style anyways, and this bag fits right in.  No, it's not as dressy as my old bag and I might feel a little strange carrying it to the wedding I am attending soon, but my husband will carry it without a problem and he refuses to hold my purses for even a second!  It basically looks like a messenger bag.I haven't tried out the cooler yet because I have no needed it, so I cannot comment on that.  I basically see if as a bonus item since the bag itself is so amazing!The only negative I can this of is that the long shoulder strap doesn't have padding, and if the buckle is at the exact right length, it will hit your shoulder painfully.  You just have to tighten or loosen it 2 inches to fix that problem when it arises.If you don't want a large bag, this is NOT for you.  But if you are like me and you tend to pack everything you can (including 6 diapers for one baby, along with 4 toys, etc...), this bag is PERFECT!  I imagine it would be great if you had more than one child, also, as it gives you separate compartments for their different needs and plenty of space to carry everything in.",5,1
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Moose","I gave this to my inlaws who are enjoying their newborn.  They love it.  Comforting, easy to clean.  The perfect product.",5,1
"Under the Nile 12 Piece Year Round Basics Sherpa Wash Cloth, White","These are super soft and thick, even after multiple washings.  Perfect for bathtime, or for cleaning baby's face or hands whenever.  These are the softest cloths I've found, and the only ones that I feel comfortable using on my baby's face.  I wet with warm water and wipe his cheeks/chin (to clean off milk/drool to prevent rash), and he smiles every time.  Yes, they curl up a little bit after you wash them, but who cares?  Lying flat is not an important criterion for me when it comes to washcloths; much more important that they are soft and organic, and wash well.  Love these!",5,1
"Pearhead Wood Bank, Giraffe","This was purchased for a new mother whose nursery theme is ""giraffes."" It is perfect for that. Fairly large with a cute, modern design. Packaging was good-looking, a turquoise box with a firm plastic window-easy to wrap. The bank's stopper is solid and keeps cash inside just fine. Because of the modern design, the bank portion will not hold tons of cash, but there is enough room to get a good start on a savings account. Parents will need to empty it occasionally, but that's OK. Very satisfied with purchase. New mother loved it. A nice touch in the nursery.",5,1
Preston 4 Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set by Glenna Jean,"It was exactly what I was expecting. The colours, texture  soft  and nice were perfect. Everything looked very nice.I just love it.",5,1
"Graco Somerset Convertible Crib, Classic White","Purchased this crib for our soon to arrive baby after much shopping and reading reviews.  This crib was a great purchase for the value and looks as good as the more expensive ones on the market.  I wanted something more neutral; non-gender specific, modern and that would last through the conversion from crib to day bed to full sized bed and this fit the ticket perfectly.  It was easy to put together.  I did it by myself, 7 months pregnant in about 20 minutes.  It's sturdy and the mattress I purchased with it fit perfectly.  It arrived quickly too and unlike some of the reviews I read, undamaged or marked despite the box it came it being completely munched.  All the parts were there and the instructions for assembly were easy to follow.  It fits great in our small nursery.  I'm very happy with the purchase so far and I think the baby will like it too.",5,1
Especially for Baby Food Processor,"I've used this to make purees for both of my babies! I bought it almost 4 years ago when my oldest was a baby. It worked perfectly and has continued to for my second child as well. Granted, there needs to be enough liquid for the food to puree properly, but that's the case for any food processor ... and making food for babies, the food needs to be a looser consistency anyway. That was never an issue for me.",5,1
3 Gumdrop Pacifiers and 1 Polka Dotted Pink Clip,"This paci clip fits any stile pacifier which is key for us since my daughter used gumdrop pacis all the way through until she gave them up.  The only issue for us was that the clip itself isn't as strong as we would have liked, our daughter persistently pulled it off of her clothing by tugging the leash.  It then because a weapon which she flung about happily until we took it away. If your child isn't as fascinated with this leash with a nice metal disk at the end as mine though this would be perfect!  Well constructed and very cute, and the pacis themselves were fantastic.",4,1
BabyMoon Pod - For Head Support &amp; Neck Support (Blue),"I will update this review in the future but I can only give a 4/5 because we have only been using the pillow for a few days now. I cannot comment as to whether or not it is helping with rounding out my sons head, but the product is very nicely made, very soft and a perfect size. I wish I ordered it sooner. My son can turn his head on it without an issue.",4,1
"JJ Cole Car Seat Canopy, Aqua Drops",It fit perfect and I love the colors!Love all of my JJ Cole Car Seat products.Would recommend to others.,5,1
"JJ Cole Car Seat Canopy, Aqua Drops","Since I live in Texas, I am battling both the sun and heat.  This cover is perfect because it's thin and covers the entire car seat.  When our infant gets a little older, we can use sunblock, but for now we use this on all of our outdoor walks. I can even open one velcro spot to peak in on our little one.  I highly recommend if you are looking for something thin, breathable, and covers the whole carseat (ours is a chicco keyfit).",5,1
"Boppy Pillow with Luxe Slipcover, Monkey","I purchased the pillow for my daughter-in-law the second day I visited her in the hospital on the birth of my first grandchild. The proud parents had discussed purchasing one before my grandson's birth, but when I saw how useful it was at the hospital it was an easy purchase on Amazon.com. It is perfect for nursing mothers and for anyone else who wants to sit with a newborn for extended time. The pillow is very supportive and yet incredibly soft. It also happens to fit in perfectly with the jungle theme of my grandson's bedroom! Love it! Daughter-in-law loves it!",5,1
"The Grandparent Gift Co. Brag Books Smiles, Daddy",I wanted to give a small gift to give my niece when she became an aunt for the first time.  She was leaving a few weeks after the baby was born to study abroad and felt bad about leaving the the baby.  It was the perfect gift to fill with pictures of the baby that she could look at while she is away.,4,1

"Mumi&amp;Bubi Solids Starter Kit, 42 x 1oz Cubes In Two Compact Baby Food Freezer Storage Trays, Plus Free e-Recipes","These trays are exactly what I was hoping for.  The size of the cubes for my daughter's first purees is perfect. The cubes can be removed easily if you follow the directions on the video.  Once the cubes are frozen I store them in a freezer bag so I can re-use the trays.  I've frozen all sorts of pureed foods in these trays: ground turkey, vegetable stock, carrots, peas, cauliflower, brown rice, spinach, sweet potato, etc. This product is a necessity for anyone who plans to make their own baby food!",5,1
"Bumble Bags Sarah Shopping Cart Cover, Evening Bloom","I wanted a shopping cart cover, but didn't want to pay out the wazoo for one. I also wanted one that was pretty big so that it fit into larger shopping carts. I stumbled upon this one. The color choices that I really wanted were out of stock (understandably so, as this is a great product), so I went ahead and went with the Peony Paradise, because I needed the item before a planned vacation. The color scheme isn't my favorite, but it's not by any means unattractive or repulsive. I've gotten lots of compliments on it at the store. It also has a lot of cushion all over, which I love because my daughter is so skinny, she needs a little extra padding. It fits Wal-Mart carts perfectly, it's a little bulky for the smaller carts, but still works fine. Also, I can use it at Costco or Sam's Club carts, but I have to scrunch it over to one side, since they have the double seated carts. It still covers all the needed areas, and I have no complaints. I have actually washed it in the washing machine twice, on low agitation, and air dried it. It has come out beautiful both time. It is a little bulky in the restaurant high chairs, but definitely covers the seat and gets the job done. I love it. Only thing I would change is the fabric color, but that is just a personal preference. This company that makes them has some great other color schemes, but were sold out at the time that I needed to order it. I also wish that it came with a bag to keep it all neat and tidy, but I usually just fold it up and strap the seat belt around it all. Overall, great product for the price, I use it all the time.",5,1
"Kids Line Luxury Security Blanket, Pink",perfect size for toddler to hold onto and washes great.  My granddaughter uses it as a napkin sometimes!  But it washes up nice and fresh.,5,1
Beco Baby Carrier Gemini - Carnival,I love how comfortable this carrier this.  It feels like I'm not even carrying any weight.  I also love how many positions it works with (front rf or ff and back).  But I do have 2 complaints about it.  1) the waist belt has an &#34;extra safely feature&#34; on the buckle which requires two hands to unbuckle which I find SO annoying since I never have both hands free (should I put my baby down on the sidewalk while I try to get out of the carrier?) and 2) the headrest straps hit my daughter right in the middle of her face when she sleeps.I think most people will love this carrier enough to overlook those annoyances but I do wish Beco would fix those things and come out with a new and improved model of this almost perfect carrier.,4,1
"Safety 1st Gentle Dreams Baby Mattress, White","I am very happy with this mattress.  I got a Graco crib and it had a big warning sign on the instructions that said it had to be used with AT LEAST a 27 1/4"" x 51 5/8"" mattress.  So that's 27.25"" x 51.625""  To be honest, those dimensions were difficult to find.  This mattress was the right price, right brand, and perfect dimensions! 27.5 x 52.5.  I wanted bigger because the more snugly it fits the better I feel. It fits great in the crib.  It is firm but not rock hard and is a waterproof material which I wasn't actually expecting. Nice surprise! It came in a big box and wrapped in plastic and had no damage whatsoever.  It was very easy for me to carry the box on my own to the nursery.  The mattress is a little bit heavy but still easy to handle. I definitely recommend this mattress, especially if you are getting a Graco crib!",5,1
"Safety 1st Gentle Dreams Baby Mattress, White","-  This mattress shipped in a box and had plastic packaging protecting the mattress.-  The mattress seems to be of high quality, compared to other mattresses that I've seen in stores.-  Fits perfectly inside crib.-  Firm, but not hard as a rock. It does have a little bit of give.-  Not the lightest mattress in terms of weight, but I wouldn't let this affect your decision. It isn't heavy by any means.",5,1
"Sassy Go-Go Guitars 2 Pack, Colors May Vary","This was a perfect find for my new cousins, whose parents are music and art lovers and are very concerned with brain-stimulation. They were just as excited to receive these for their new baby as I was to discover them to give to her!",5,1
Sassy Developmental Sensory Ball Set - Inspires Touch,These balls were perfect for my 8 month old granddaughter.  The blue one is her favoritebecause it is easy for her little hands to crasp. When I roll them all out that is the one she goesto first.  She can pick it up and throw it easily.  The others are also great.,5,1

Match my daughter's room perfectly. And she loved them.,4,1
"UPPAbaby 2013 G-lite Stroller, Denny Red","This was perfect for traveling. I felt like we got our money's worth. It doesn't recline, but I guess that feature would add weight. I was looking for something lightweight, so this worked well for me. My son is a big 2.5 year old and he seemed comfortable in it. He took naps in it - didn't always look comfortable (but I also don't have a flexible, nimble 2.5 year old body) - but he even took an epic 3 hour nap in the stroller while we were out and about.",5,1
The Original Theraline Maternity &amp; Nursing Pillow with 2 Removable Zippered 100% Cotton Jersey Knit Covers - Ecru &amp; Reed Green,"Although, this pillow is pretty expensive to some of the other regular nursing pillow, it is totally worth the prize. I love it and have been using it during my pregnancy to support my legs - it definitely helped a lot. It will also be perfect for nursing, since you can put it around you in any position you want and it is soft to be adjusted easily!",5,1
"BambinOz Porta Chair Travel High Chair, Slate","Love this chair, I tried out a number of chairs before selecting this one as it was the best fit and baby loves it. I really like how compact it is. Unfortunately there is a problem with the buckles, after only 2 uses one of the buckles shattered at the point where the tabs click in, it appears to be a problem with the plastic as it is very brittle. Waiting to see how the company manages this, I expect they will just replace it but hope they also look at the materials they are using. Except for the buckle it was otherwise perfect.",4,1

Roan Rocco Classic Pram Stroller 2-in-1 with Bassinet and Seat Unit - Coffee,I have to say doing business with D'salika Team has been a very good experience. They kept me updated all the days I was waiting for Pram because Canada had railroad strike in that time and sellers were worried about shipping more than me))). Dasalika Team's really helpful and supportive. I couldn't find at stores something like this Pram so thanks Dasalika Team for this opportunity to order it on line.We bought the Roan Rocco Classic Pram Stroller  because we initially liked the look of it. After much internet research and test drives at baby stores we decided to purchase it and did not regret our decision. Th' Roan Rocco Pram is excellent and we love the versatility of it! The classical bassinet is very roomy and and feels sturdy. This Pram is also perfect for winter time and any bumpy road.,5,1
Summer Infant Baby Touch Digital Color Video Monitor,"We are first time parents and did alot of research on monitors and are VERY happy with our purchase!  We live in a two story house and this is perfect for viewing our little girl with out having to go upstairs for each cry.  It is also perfect when we are outside.  I love that it is charable on the stand and when plugged in the picture says on but if you use the monitor off the charger, it will go in time saver mode.  My husband put this right next to the crib and it peers through the crib bars with perfect picture.  If you are looking for a video monitor - this is highly reccomended.",5,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Diaper Stacker,Perfect lil diaper stacker and matches the theme of my grandson's bedding. Very pleased with the colors and how well it matched other items in the nursery.,5,1
Swaddlebees 6 Piece Baby Wipes,"I didn't know which cloth wipes where best so I ordered four different brands and like these the best.  They are the perfect size in length and widith for my standard wipe warmer and are soft yet great at picking up the dirty business on my baby's bottom.  I used disposable wipes at first and am in love with cloth wipes!  It only takes one wipe for the dirtiest poop, where as it could take three or more disposable wipes.  The cost savings is huge!  And it doesn't add extra laundry since I cloth diaper already and they are small.  I use with Lusa Organics Baby Wipe Juice and love them both!  Hope this helps.",5,1
Ocean Wonders Sea Life Single Toggle Wall Plate Cover,I purchased the plate cover to go with my Ocean Wonders theme nursery and they went perfectly! I love them!!,5,1
"Blueberry by Swaddlebees 6 Piece Baby Cloth Wipes, Aqua","I like these best (though I haven't had them more than a few months, so I can't report on durability) because not only does my daughter say they are very soft, but they are the perfect size to just lay right in the wipe warmer, without having to roll or fold. It's a small time saver, but totally worth it.",5,1
"Buggy Bagg Elite Shopping Cart Cover, Groovy","I comparison-shopped tons of cart covers and hesitated before splurging on the Buggy Bagg Elite Shopping Cart Cover.  I quickly realized that that ease of use was just as important as effectiveness.  (Who wants a cover they have to struggle with?  I knew I would abandon using anything that was a hassle or didn&#8217;t work universally on all carts.) So I dithered about the price.  And I wavered because I didn&#8217;t particularly love the prints available from Buggy Bagg.  But in the end I decided to just go for it&#8230; the glowing reviews deserved credence!  I'm not a bit sorry - this cart cover is amazing and so thoughtfully designed.  Its practicality, ease of use, comfort, and adaptability to any cart size trumps concerns about price or any of my minor aesthetic preferences.My first trip out with the Buggy Bagg was to Costco on a busy weekend.  With one arm holding an 8 month old, I was easily able to set it up in the over-sized cart.  Within a few moments we were coasting into the store.  The baby was ensconced in padded comfiness and the attached pillow was the perfect support behind his back so that he fit into the cart snugly and felt secure.  I was able to shop peaceably and the baby was able to play agreeably with some toys tethered to the cart cover.  Upon leaving the store, I unbuckled the baby and got him in his car seat in a jiffy.  The cart cover easily flopped into itself (with attached toys and pillow inside) and was ready to be zipped-up.Since then, this cart cover has eliminated my anxiety about shopping with the baby.  I know I can maneuver him easily by myself, that he will be comfortable and entertained while I'm shopping, that the cover is keeping him from touching grimy carts, that the cover is easily folded up, and that the whole thing is machine-washable.  I don't mind paying extra for such a well-designed and useful product.PROS* Dark solid exterior hides grime* Soft but sturdy fabric* Stitched well with binding on all edges including the handy interior pockets* Attached pillow can be used behind or in front of baby* Ease of use (unfolds and folds up quite easily into itself and is its own bag)* Exterior zipper is heavy-duty and easy to use* Baby is buckled in with the Buggy Bagg belt, not the cart's belt* All touchable surfaces of the cart are covered* Padding everywhere for baby, including the post wrap-around between the legs, but not so fluffy that the thing becomes an amorphous blob* Light-weight* Can store tethered toys inside* Can store notepad, coupons, and/or wipes in the cart pocket that flops over the back of the baby's seatCONS* Seems to be the most expensive baby cart cover on the market* Limited fabric prints* Size when folded up is not super small - you will not be able to tuck this into your purse or diaper bag* Would not use in a high chair &#8211; I bought a separate, smaller cover designed specifically for restaurant high chairs that fits easily into a diaper bag (BRICA Deluxe High Chair Cover )",5,1

"Dreambaby 3 Pack Secure A - Lock, White","These were perfect for my handles, and knobs on cabinets in my kitchen and sun room. If your cabinet knobs are very close together they may not work for you. They are so easy for me to open with one hand but keep my baby out. Perfect! Safety First brand that has a little red/ green indicator window were awful.  I couldn't even open those with both of my hands. This brand was perfect for me just measure how far apart your handles are. Would probably work well for ones extra far apart to. Give them a try!",5,1

"Comotomo Baby Bottle, Green/Pink, 5 Ounce, 2-Count",This are the best bottles I have ever used. The flow is perfect for 3+ months. No leaks out the sides of mouth. I used the 5oz bottles when my baby was a newborn. They seemed to improve my baby's latch for breastfeeding also.,5,1
"Lamaze Crib Soother, Northern Lights",I have an addventurous little baby boy that was always smacking his head on our previous crib soother. This one is so nice because it is soft sided so I dont wake up to a bumpy headed baby anymore! The sound is nice. We really only use the nature sounds though as that is most relaxing. There are many different ways to set this soother and it works perfectly for cribs that transition to a full size bed. Easy on and off application making changing the sheets very easy.,5,1

Levana ClearVu Digital Video Baby Monitor with Color Changing Night Light (LV-TW301),"Functionality:This device is extremely easy to use.  You can control the brightness and the volume from the monitor unit.  The picture is excellent and clear.  The audio is surprisingly good, and gets quite loud.  I think this is excellent for parents who want to stay apprised of what's going on, since you really can hear everything.You can add more cameras (to a total of 4) and the included wall mount was perfect for watching from the top corner of a room.  Seeing my 2 year old, Penelope, play or sleep is almost as much fun from the screen as it is in person.Nightvision is extremely strong, with a very large array of IR bulbs enabling crisp video in very dark rooms.  Be aware that this camera will conflict with Wii-motes.  I had to move mine to a different corner.The nightlight function is really cool.  You can turn it off, but I think it's charming.  Another thing you can set is having the camera send video if it hears sound.  The monitor has its own charging base which thankfully produces a very faint green light when charged (we hate brighter LEDs in our bedroom... this one doesn't disturb us at all).Build Quality:Really high, IMO.  The receiver is solid, its charger holds it nicely, the camera's night lite is pleasant.  Everything has a durable feel.Value:This seems expensive to me, but I've never bought a comparable product.  It's well constructed, simple to operate, and does a good and reliable job.  I looked around and don't see anything that represents a better value for what this product can do.So congrats on the child in your family or friend's family, and if you want a monitor, I recommend this one.",5,1
Fisher Price Fastfinder On The Go Backpack Diaper Bag - Brown,"I have 3 children and have gone through many diaper bags over the years.  I have been using the JJ Cole Collections System Diaper Bag in cocoa oval for almost a year now (my son is almost 1).  I really love the bag and found it ""almost perfect"" as well which is why I have used it as long as I have.  For me the reason for change is that with my boy getting bigger and heavier, it is sometimes hard on my shoulder to be using a shoulder strap bag.  I decided a backpack style (that would distribute the weight on both shoulders) is better.  I don't carry the diaper bag a lot but if I have to go in and out of places with it, I figured a backpack style would be ideal.  If I'm using the stroller the JJ Cole has stroller attachments and I have always used those.  To my surprise this bag has stroller attachments as well.  It doesn't list it in the description but it does have them where the straps are on the back.  My main complaint with this bag is that for me the bottle section doesn't fit more than one bottle and for me it barely fits that.  I have been using the Born Free bottles (which I didn't think were very bulky or wide) and I couldn't zip the compartment all the way closed.  Grant it, my son is on his way to using a sippy cup but still takes the bottle right now and thankfully I don't usually need more than 1 bottle when I'm out and about but I was disappointed that it didn't fit properly.  Likewise, there really is no spot for a sippy cup, other than placing it in the main compartment which is nice and deep and has plenty of room but my concern is that if it tilts and leaks (although most sippy cups are designed not to leak, inevitably some do)it will be all over the inside.  I have not used the front 2 pockets for anything as of yet.  I like the pacifier compartment and the wipes compartment on the outside is a superb idea.  Love that.  Likewise, I love that each compartment is essentially labeled so you know what goes where.  Of course you can always customize it to your liking I suppose but the specific compartments are helpful.  I use the front zippered pocket for kleenex and other random things.  The inside has some nice pockets on both sides that you can use to your liking.  Even with every pocket on the outside and inside full you still have plenty of room in the main section of the bag.  I personally would have loved maybe a divider of some kind in the middle of the bag so I can toss my things on one side and baby things on the other but that's not a deal breaker for me.  Bottom line, I definitely recommend this bag if your looking for a backpack style bag.  Nicely organized and plenty of room.",4,1
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White","Ok, I rarely rate or review but I really like this baby gate!  I bought it to replace an old one that broke and it's way better than the old.  Here's what I like:Door swings both waysThe mechanism is super easy to open with one handIt looks niceThe opening is nice and wideIt's secure and tall enough to keep my dogs (medium sized huskies) on one side of itIt was totally easy to installMy house has lots of gates to control access by my dogs and my toddler.  This is my favorite one but I will caution that it is the only one my 3-year old has figured out how to open.  So, it is not toddler-proof but other than that it is perfect!",5,1
"Munchkin Extending Extra Tall and Wide Metal Gate, White",This gate would be perfect if there were additional adjustments possible. I made a small modification (cut 3/4&#34; off of the latching bolts) that allowed for a perfect fit. The gate is very sturdy and easy to operate. I ordered two and am considering a third gate.,4,1
"Munchkin Extending Metal Gate, White","We are no strangers to walk through gates.  We have used different types over the years.  We bought this one because we found it for a good price, it doesn't have the bar across the bottom and we liked the slim design.Upon installation, however we discovered the screws are worthless.  The first one we tried to use broke.  That did not surprise us because we had read the reviews.  We wanted to see for ourselves and sure enough... those screws are worthless. My husband is a Carpenter by trade so he just went into the garage and got longer and stronger screws.We've had this gate installed for 3 months now and we still love it.  I would say our gate is in a high traffic area.  With 7 children in the house I would say we open and close this gate at least 30+ times a day. It's still in perfect working condition.",4,1
"Munchkin Easy-Close Extra Tall and Wide Metal Gate, Dark Grey","It's hard to find a wide gate that's also tall and looks good. This as close as I could find to the perfect gate to contain our golden retriever in the kitchen. As others have mentioned, it will not fit every opening as the extra pieces can only be adjusted a small amount with the side screws. Someone left a review with all of the measurements that will work, so check that out if you're unsure. I am concerned that the plastic latch may not hold up over time, but we try not to slam it and if I'm not in a hurry I carefully latch it to make sure it lasts. We used the pressure mount disks and have had no trouble with it moving at all. We had a party and it was nice to be able to take it down for that event. (The paint did come off the wall under one of the disks.)  Glad I found this gate!",5,1
"Neat Solutions Appliqued Thank Heaven Cotton Pique/ Knit Terry Bib and Burpcloth Set, Boy","I LOVE LOVE LOVE these bibs!  They're so hard to find.  I've only found 3-packs of them at Kohl's.  I bought this 2-piece set only for the bib but figured I could use the burpcloth sometime.  These bibs have this extra dry-weave layer on top (strange analogy, but kind of like a pantiliner) so it pulls the spit-up down into the next layer.  But it isn't embedded down in there.  It washes up perfectly!!!  Definitely the best bibs for the first 6 months when your baby is spitting up when you burp them.  My FAVORITE bibs!",5,1

"Lil Joey 2 Pack All-In-One Cloth Diaper, Lux","These are a perfect fit for a newborn and will grow with your baby.They do not have inserts, but are thick enough to handle pretty much anything that a small baby will need.  However, because of the elastic they need to be snapped open inverted before washing to come clean properly, and they take a while to dry because of the thickness.  Just keep that in mind for measuring out how many you need to purchase.",5,1
"Rumparooz Reusable Cloth Pocket Diaper, Ladder 6, Aplix","When I was pregnant I researched cloth diapers the entire 9 months and decided to make up my stash of the following:-Prefolds/covers for newborn stage (first 2 months primarily, but still use occasionally because Rumparooz also makes covers with awesome colors and prints; I also use Flip covers which are really good)-Pocket diapers: Best started fitting my baby when she was a good 8-9lbs. I mostly own all the versions that BumGenius makes as well as Rumparooz. I've recently purchased a couple more Rumparooz G2 because they are just that great.I have both the Aplix(hook and loop) and snaps versions. Naturally snaps typically last longer, but I think it's good to have a couple Aplix versions for dads, sitters, grandparents, overnight use, and quick on-the-go. And the aplix is really sturdy and well made. Always line-dry these diapers for extended longevity.What I love: Inner gussets contain explosive poo quite well. The interior and exterior material are well made; the included 6R soaker is microfiber. The fit is perfect and trim (a little low rise, but I like the look). My baby is now about 10lbs, so she is still using the newborn soaker pad, but occasionally I'll add the 2nd soaker and the fit is still nice and unobtrusively bulky.It's pricey, but you almost always get what you pay for. I highly recommend this diaper!",5,1

"Safety 1st Travel Ease Plus Play Yard , Droplet","Playard is perfect!  Bought this one for our 3rd child due in a few weeks.  It only took this very pregnant mamma 5 minutes to set it up, bassinet top and changing station and all.  Very easy to break down too.  Love that it comes with a carrying case that has two zippered compartments. I was not willing to spend $$$ on a playard with all the useless bells and whistles.  This will go perfect in our bedroom.  Love that it has locking wheels.Would have given it 5 stars, but one thing kept me from doing so.  It seemed like the bassinet top could be a little sturdier.  It attaches with plastic tabs that connect on the inside of the playard, as apposed to the outside like most.  It does say that 15lbs is the weight limit for the bassinet.Overall, WELL worth the money.  Do not waste your money on the most expensive brands...",4,1
"BOB Sport Utility Single Stroller, Blue","So great and easy to run with. I got mine a little cheaper because the box was damaged, but the stroller was in perfect condition. It's like a super excellent bicycle transformed into a stroller. We've been out running almost everyday since. The only thing I'm not happy with is the lack of cup-holder...$30 additional for a cup-holder! Besides that, AMAZING!",5,1
"BOB Sport Utility Single Stroller, Blue","Absolutely very best stroller for our purposes. We purchased this stroller in addition to the Britax car seat attachment. We live on a dirt road which is made of road base and gravel. With rain and other elements, there are many ruts and holes that make it impossible for most strollers to go past. When using this stroller, my five week old literally slept the entire way and we had no issues whatsoever navigating the terrain. I was even able to take him through pieces of my yard where we have high ornamental grass with ease. My neighbor said she purchased a different type of Bob stroller that did not work in our area. The sport-utility version is perfect for people who need to get out on roads less traveled&#8230;",5,1

"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","I did a lot of research and looking at reviews when I was pregnant with my daughter (my first). From all I read, the BOB was the way to go. Despite the price tag attached, we ordered it and I LOVE IT!! We have had it 2 years now and it's been well worth every penny spent (cost has went down a lot since then!)!! My husband and I are both runners and I enjoy doing shorter races for fun so this has been the perfect jogger for us. I'd say maybe if one isn't much into running, but does more walking or real minimal running, then they may choose to seek a cheaper stroller, but if running is part of your lifestyle several time a week, invest in a BOB.We just had my son 3 weeks ago and just ordered this exact same stroller in a Duallie. We should get it tomorrow and I'm SO SO excited to start jogging again!! Anxiously awaiting our delivery tomorrow!!",5,1
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","We bought this stroller after it was recommended by friend that used their's for 5 years w/o any complaints. We love it!! Smooth ride and great handling. You can even use it to run, although I haven't personally. My sister-in-law has the double and runs with it all the time. The only down side is its size. We have a small SUV and if you lay the stroller flat it takes up most of the back so we use a bungee cord to keep it on its side up against the back seat. This works out perfectly for us.",5,1
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","This stroller handles like a dream and it is so super light. It is perfect for walks or jogging and it can handle any terrain. Although it folds very easily, it is very very bulky when folded. Would not recommend using this stroller if you use public transportation or for grocery shopping or in any high congestion area (the front wheel sticks out to much and people catch their heel on it). We reviewed a number of stroller before making this purchase and so far we are very happy with our decision.",4,1
"BOB Ironman Single Stroller, Yellow","This stroller has been nothing short of great.  It's light-weight and easily fits into the hatch area of our station wagon and trunk of our Honda Civic.  They certainly made some improvements to earlier models too.  I used my sister's that is about 5 years older and my 3 month old son didn't fit in it, but he fit perfect at that age in our newer model.I am competitive runner and this stroller has performed just as well at 6 minuter per mile pace to 8/9 minutes per mile pace.",5,1
Dr. Brown's BPA Free Deluxe Gift Set,"I opted for Dr. Browns again because my first child got used to the nipples from a very early age and barely had any gas.

Beaba Babypote - Reusable Kids Squeeze Pouch,"We purchased this for our 18 month old who loves pouches of apple sauce from the store.  We can make our own apple sauce cheaper and make less waste, and this helps keep our snack ""on the go"".  It does come out faster than some other store bought pouches, but that also varies greatly on the texture of what you put in the pouch. Easy to clean, easy for him to use, holds way more food than store bought as well. This is perfect for mom's who make their own baby food (just squeeze it onto a spoon for those not ready to suck it out) and wonderful for bigger toddlers who need a snack to take along! Worth the money!",5,1
"Summer Infant Easton Tote, Black/White","This bag is very cute and it holds enough stuff for a day out with my 2 year old and 2 month old. I use cloth diapers and it holds enough for both kids (about 6 prefolds and a spare cover for the baby and a couple of pocket diapers for the toddler), as well as a wetbag, a couple receiving blankets, a sippy cup for my toddler, an extra change of clothes for both kids, a travel pack of wipes and a few cloth wipes, and my stretchy wrap. It also has enough room for all my mommy essentials, (wallet, phone, keys, agenda book, etc.) It has tons of pockets that are perfect for organization. The print is cute and stylish enough that I don't feel like a dork when carrying it, I have even received a few compliments on it.Since a previous reviewer mentioned it, I do feel the need to disclose that the black in the design is not a perfect jet black like it appears in the photo, but it is still cute and very functional so I give it 5 stars.",5,1
"Safety 1st OnSide Air Protect Convertible Car Seat, Adeline Black","I ordered this seat for my 10 month old son. He is around 19 pounds and 28in and it is perfect. He also has plenty of room to grow. I drive a Honda Accord so I was worried that it may not fit. It fits great in the the middle of the back seat. My husband is 6'1 and he can drive with the seat all the way back with no trouble. My son seems very comfortable in it also. Installation wasn't any harder than any other seat I have installed. I did have to put a rolled towel under the front of the seat to get it level, but it wasn't a big deal. Overall I am extremely happy with the seat. I will have to uninstall the seat to adjust the shoulder strap height but you don't have to do that often, so it shouldn't be a problem. I shopped around for weeks before I bought this seat and I am so glad I did. It also has a good ammount of padding, which is one thing I was looking for.",5,1
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","This is a great product for traveling or if you are renting a house and don't want to damage a door due to installation of a door lock.  This product is SOOOO easy to use!  You can put it on the door in 2 seconds.  You just push a button and grip the door monkey to the door.  It works perfectly with our daughter (24 months old).  She tries to open and pull on the door, and this little guys just stays put!  She doesn't pull really hard or try to rock the door back and forth like other reviewers stated, so I don't want to claim it would work great in those situations;  however, from the look of it, it seems as though it would still withstand a lot more pressure as compared to what my daughter does.  I love that you can just take it off the door and use it on whatever door you need.  For example, we just bought one, and I take it off my daughter's bedroom door and put it on the bathroom door sometimes.  It will also be great to travel with (as long as the doors frames are the standard rectangular shape).  In short, I LOVE this product and would buy more if we weren't on a budget.  But it's great for those on a budget because you only have to have 1 door monkey because you can move it easily from door to door!",5,1
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","We have lever type door handles and needed something to keep our toddler out of the hall medicine supply closet.  I didnt even want to try one of those top of the door locks, as I am only 5'1, so I needed something practical.  The lever type safety devices did not receive great reviews, so I checked this door monkey out.  Started out cautiously and only ordered one to see if it would fit properly and work well.  It clipped snugly right onto the door and worked great. It didnt take my daughter long to figure out that she cannot pull the door open anymore, and that doesnt even seem to bother her.  The way the device works and is made causes the door to stay cracked open, so it's possible for little ones to get their hands in the door and tug on it, but it has held up perfectly these past 6 months despite a few tugging episodes.The opening is not enough that she can reach anything in the closet to pull it out.  Because the door stays cracked open, these are only meant for interior doors. The second one I later ordered for another door, the pantry, does not fit as snug on the door, but it stays up despite that and has undergone tugging without any problems so far. She pulled a chair over to the pantry door recently and tried to figure out, unsucessfully, how to make the device open the door.  She recently turned two.  No, she isnt starving, she is just a two year old who loves to play and get into everything (ie. I forgot and left the pantry open the other day and found her digging her sand shovel in the bag of flour).  It is easy enough to just move the door monkey up high out of their reach, even if they have a chair :).  I am now ordering a third door monkey for another problem area of the house.  I think $13 is a bit much for this piece of plastic, but it has worked well for us.",5,1

Sealy Baby Firm Rest Crib Mattress,"I found it somewhat comical in reading the other reviews when some people were saying this mattress is too firm and others saying it's too soft.  Anyway--I found that this mattress is (in my opinion) somewhere in-between (go figure!).  I like that it's thick and has the plastic-like cover already on it.  The price was right too.  It's not a firm mattress--my little guy leaves a small indent in it when he sleeps at night, but it's not too soft either because he's able to easily roll around and pull to stand at the side of the crib (without the mattress caving in).  It fits our crib perfectly--no gaps around the edges (I would tell you the namebrand of the crib except that it's super old school and has the drop-down sides which are now frowned-upon so not sure how useful that would be to others).  I found this mattress to be of good quality and would order another one if needed.  Plus, hello!, you can't go wrong with free returns from Amazon if you decide you don't like it.  Not to mention that it was delivered to my door which is a huge plus.  It's quite difficult to purchase a crib mattress at a local store with a baby in tow only then to try to fit it in your 4-door sedan.  No thank you!",4,1

"Lollaland Lollacup, Good Green",I read tons of reviews about various sippy cups before choosing this one.  From what I could tell there isn't a perfect sippy cup.  I really like that  this cup is made from U.S. plastic.  It is more expensive then many of the sippy cups out there but I am so thankful that Lollaland has made a sippy cup using U.S. plastic.  There were a few reviews about this cup being easily broken when dropped on a hard surface.  I have kept this in mind and this cup is only used when my daughter is seated in her highchair with supervision.  This cup also has a great warranty so I thought it was worth the price and risk of it breaking.  I wanted to start my daughter with drinking from a straw to get her use to drinking from a cup.  We have been breastfeeding so this has been a big change for her.  So far it has worked but I have only tried this cup a handful of times.  I am still breastfeeding but I also give her some milk in this cup.  When I put the straw in her mouth she knows to suck on it!  I think it has been the easiest way to introduce the concept of drinking from a cup to my 7 month old.Update June 2014:  My daughter is now 1-1/2 and Lollacup has definitely become her sippy of choice.  I recently bought two more cups because she uses it so much.  One of the top reviews for this product mentions trouble with the cup breaking when dropped.  We have hardwood floors in our house and my daughter has dropped this cup on numerous occasions from her high chair and it has not broken yet.  She also runs around the house with the cup and we have had no problems with it breaking.  In contrast we had a cheap cup from target that only lasted a few months before needing to be thrown out due to it breaking.  One time I even dropped the cup on our concrete garage floor when getting out of the car and the hood on the lid popped off but I was able to pop it back on no problem.  My daughter has used this cup almost every single day for the last 6 months and it is still holding up fine.  There is a little wear around the very top of the cup where the roosters ""comb"" is.  Also the straw has gotten a little stained looking.  We love this cup so much we bought two more just recently.  Well worth the price tag in my opinion.Pros:When the lid is closed it's leak proofProduct is made in USADurable,5,1
"NUK Replacement Silicone Spout, Clear",My son liked to chew his spouts to make the hole bigger.  We were unable to find replacements at the local stores but were fortunate to find them on Amazon.

lillebaby Nordic Carrier,"I used the Bjorn with my daughter for the first 3 months and couldn't wait for her to fit into an Ergo.  I tried the infant insert with the Ergo and it didn't work out at all (she wasn't happy, positioning weird, too hot).  The Bjorn isn't very comfy and you can't nurse in it.  The Ergo is just too big for the under 6 month crowd.  BUT... the Nordic is perfect!  Very comfortable for baby and mama right from the beginning because the seat adjusts for small babies (vs the Ergo which is very wide and the baby has to really spread their legs).  There is no need for an insert, you can nurse in it very easily, and you can wear the baby forward as well (you can't in the Ergo)!!  My little one needs to be facing out once in a while as she fusses if she is facing in too long.  I have a 3 year old to keep up with, so I think it is great that I can change positions to keep the baby happy as long as possible in the carrier. She sleeps facing in or out and is a very happy baby in this carrier.  She is in it for at least 4 hours a day and I have no pain.  It is very, very comfortable. It looks nice, and is very easy to put on (easier than the Lillebaby Everywear because the straps are padded like the Ergo, not adjustable).  Two criticisms: there is a sleep hood attachment, but it does not come with the carrier and is not for sale on Amazon, and there is no pocket on the carrier (although you can order a cell phone case for $15).",5,1
"Safety 1st Nature Next 3-in-1 Potty, Lime",This potty was perfect for my 20 month old.  She loved using it and it was a great size.  I loved that it was inexpensive and ""green.""  We used it as a stool and as an insert in the regular toilet as well.  Great purchase! We will be using it again with my younger daughter.,5,1
Safety 1st 4 Pack ProGrade Pivot Position Cabinet and Drawer Latches,"Once installed, I really like these latches.  They seem to be of high quality and will last a long time.  I love the fact that you can disable them for times when you don't want the cabinet locked.  Installation does take a bit of time and patience.  Reading through the instructions the first time I was a bit confused on how to use the template, but once I understood it, I thought it was quite clever.  There is a two-sided adhesive template that you stick to one side (the catch), mark or drill your holes, then remove the adhesive backing to transfer the template to the perfect spot on the cabinet door to drill holes there.  In theory, its perfect.  In practice, it can be frustrating.  If your cabinets have dampeners (which I assume most cabinets do to prevent wood on wood slamming) the ""transfer"" step can be tricky.  If you are attaching to a left and right set of open cabinets, you can easily reach around and through the other half to help the template transfer.  If you are doing a single cabinet or drawer with no way to reach the backside with the cabinet/drawer closed, sometimes the transfer just doesn't happen as you don't get good contact.",5,1
Safety 1st Magnetic Locking System Complete,"We bought these for our kitchen cabinets once our 1-year-old daughter figured out how to open and close every single one nonstop! Some of the ones we looked at allow the cabinets to be opened an inch or two (like the kind with the hooks), which means that fingers can still get pinched.  These were the perfect solution!  Cabinets are kept tightly closed without the magnet to open them. They can also be turned 'off' (so they can be opened like normal) when you choose, so it's win-win.  We live in an old house where things aren't quite lined up all the times, so they took a bit of effort to get them all lined up properly (and they definitely take some time to install regardless), but once they were in, it's been great.  Definitely recommend!",5,1
Safety 1st Magnetic Locking System Complete,This system is perfect if you have small children. It didn't take too long to install and I like that you can't see them from the outside of the cabinets.,5,1
The First Years Disney/Pixar Cars Simple and Secure Booster,"love this booster seat, it is the perfect size for any chair and my granddaughter loves it,  will fit for a while",5,1
The First Years Disney/Pixar Cars Simple and Secure Booster,I purchased this seat for my 16 month old son. It is the perfect height. He fits at the table naturally and loves the seat. It is safe and secure and he seems very comfortable in it. It is also very portable and easy to take anywhere. A great buy!,4,1
"Peg-Perego Pliko Mini Stroller, Aloe","I needed a stroller that would fit in the trunk of my Chevy Sonic, no mean feat, I can tell you. Because of it's clever fold, this folds a lot shorter than your average umbrella stroller. And what a fold it has - one-handed and super-quick - it's awesome!! The stroller is very lightweight too so it's really a great travel stroller from that respect. It maneuvers well and can cope with a few bags over the handles without tipping over. The recline and canopy are ok, not amazing, but they do the job. The basket is pretty useless. It's small, hard to get to and has a habit of coming off of it's hooks. My First Years Ignite has waaaay better storage, especially when you include the parent caddy, which this does not have (it doesn't even have a cup holder!!). But it's much lighter and shorter than the Ignite. It feels a bit &#34;rickety&#34; when you push it but it's held up to everything I've thrown at it so far. If only they would improve the basket and include a foldable parent caddy then it would be just about perfect!",4,1
"Summer Infant Waterproof Full Length Crib Pad, White, 27&quot; x 52&quot;",I really like this pads size and thickness. It fits the baby mattress perfectly. It is also soft (after washing).,5,1
"Summer Infant Plush Pals Changing Pad Cover, Green/Brown (Monkey)",I got the green monkey one. This cover is so soft and fits my standard size changing pad perfectly. It still looks like new after multiple washes. It also helps in keeping the pad a little warmer. My little girl had crush on monkeys. You will love this and the price is right. You will enjoy laying your baby down to change diper on this pad cover. I couldn't be happier with this cover.,5,1
"Summer Infant 4 Piece Monkey Jungle Collection Crib Set, Neutral",very cute and fits the mini crib perfectly.,5,1
"Summer Infant 4 Piece Monkey Jungle Collection Crib Set, Neutral","Let's just get to the negatives! The colors aren't as vibrant as the photos; however, the photos don't really show the details of the animal characters on the comforter.  On the comforter, the monkey is made out of some type of plush velour and his ears protrude from the comforter. Absolutely cute and comfy! The animals and font are very large and easy for any baby or child to see and I love the pastel Easter like colors on the sheets and bedskirt. I purchased a pastel green solid fitted sheet from Carter's and it went perfectly with this set.I will agree with other reviewers that the bumper is a thin sheet of material, but I own a sewing machine and will rip the side seams to refill the bumper...and extra $5 purchase at JoAnns and I will have a perfect bumper! Easy, cheap fix and not to mention I didn't want to spend $200 on bedding when I just spent that plus on a crib and mattress. Another safari set I found the bumper was $59.99 by itself! That is crazy and I love this one more because of the inclusion of words with the animals. I can teach my little one as we cuddle.After I wash this comforter, I will come back and review how it withstands multiple washes.",4,1
"Sorelle Lynn 4-in-1 Convertible Crib w, Changing Table Nursery Set in Merlot","Arrived in 2 boxes and in perfect condition. The pictured color is accurate. I wasn't sure about such a big commitment of money on a product that is sight unseen AND happens to be the 2 most important pieces in the nursery. But, I'm glad we took the chance. All pieces are solid wood except the 3 shelves that are with the changing table. But those 3 pieces are painted to match and they look fantastic. I have the shelves loaded and they are holding up well with no sagging. The whole set is very solid and sturdy. And it is beautiful! Assembly was simple. I'm 7 mos pregnant and I put this set together without my husband or anyone else. Sit on the floor in a good sized open space with a good show on tv or some music and you'll have it together in no time. Overall, I love this set! I'm really happy with our choice. The only thing that would make it a 5 star is a cheaper price.",4,1
"Evenflo 4 Pack Simplymilk Storage Bottles, 5 Ounce","These are WONDERFUL, versatile, and just a joy to use. They are perfect for pumping, storing, and feeding. They really quite useful.

"South Shore Precious Collection Changing Table, Royal Cherry","We ordered this to go with the Davinci Rowan crib in espresso since the finishes looked so similar and the lines mimicked each other.  The finishes are so close that unless you get ALOT of light in the room, you can't tell the difference. I was thrilled about that.Now, when it arrived, it was H E A V Y.  This is not some lightweight collection of particle board. And one end of the carton had been damaged which went thru to the edge of the top piece. I followed the instructions included and called their 800 number and told them which piece it was and they shipped that piece right to us. Took about 4 days to get here and was WELL wrapped and in perfect condition. We had been smart and ordered this more than a month before we'd put it together anyway, so it wasn't an issue.Putting it together was a beast. The instructions aren't the clearest in the world and it took the better part of 6 hours or so, but we weren't in any rush. My Hubby put it together with his mom. We chose not to put the bottom in the top drawer of the pull out on the right side and put the hamper in there instead. Worked out great.I am very happy with the dresser/changing table. I think it's beautiful, it has plenty of room for baby clothes and once he's older it'll be perfect for underwear, socks and sleepwear since we have another dresser for other clothes. And for the money it's heavy duty particle board with beautiful veneer. If you want real wood, you're gonna pay 2 or 3 times this. So just make sure you order this early, in case you need to have pieces re-sent (not surprising really since it's soooo heavy) and so you have plenty of time to put it together. But I would totally buy it again.",4,1

Kolcraft Pure Sleep Therapeutic 150 Crib Mattress,I was a bit skeptical at first since this mattress is so cheap compared to some of the other ones at other stores.

I am very pleased with my purchase!,5,1

Baby Trend Sit-N-Stand DX Stroller - Matrix,"Love, this stroller!!!  Was concerned about the negative reviews from various sites, but decided to try it anyway.  This Sit n Stand is a lifesaver!  Toddlers love standing on the back platform, while the younger one sits in the front.  The child in the back can sit, if he/she chooses, while seat belted to the jump seat.  Mall runs are more peaceful, as the child can sit or stand (on back only).  Some children dislike sitting for long periods of time.  This stroller enables them to stand too, so you can keep shopping.  This stroller folds up smaller than the Graco DuoGlider, is easier to maneuver/turn, handles tight turns with ease (one handed even), rolls smoothly, and absorbs a lot of shock.  Better than the Graco DuoGlider.  It has only one snack tray (front), but when you child is old enough to stand on the back, they should be coordinated enough to eat from snack cups or to sit at the table anyway.  I have a double snack cup that attaches to just about any stroller frame ($15 at Toys r Us) and works perfectly for the back seat of this Baby Trend.  The front snack tray folds into two positions, and is completely removable.  It is also big and allows young ones their own table for eating.  Love it!!!!!  The canopy covers both heads, the kid in front and back, when seated.  No cons to this stroller.  Took it on gravel, dirt, and grass for a test drive and no issues.  It even glides smoothly/easily on grass!  The storage basket underneath has a big open area in the rear, which makes putting objects into it easy.  With the Graco DuoGlider, I had to lift the back seat up to fit some items into the storage basket.  This Baby Trend is perfect, modern, sleek, lightweight (about 26 lbs) and easy to use.  The Graco DuoGlider weighs about 32 lbs.  Assembly took 2 minutes.  It comes 95% assembled.  You just attach the tray, canopy, rear wheels, and rear platform (all pop into place, no tools needed).  I traded in my Graco for this Baby Trend and have NO REGRETS.  I forgot to mention it is VERY sturdy and stable, as well.  It is also easy to transport in trunks of average cars because it folds up so small.",5,1
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump with On the Go Tote,"There is a reason that this pump is so popular.  Medela has gotten it right with this pump.  It includes what you need to quickly, effectively, & safely express breastmilk for your child.I also own a Medela Swing pump that I am very pleased with.  I believe that Medela pumps are of the highest quality.I have NEVER had milk back up into my tubing.  I am not quite sure how this might happen when using the pump as instructed.  Sometimes I find some condensation in the tubing.  I simply run the pump for a couple minutes while storing my breastmilk & then turn the pump off.  If you do find you have milk in the tubing (or too much condensation), simply run rubbing alcohol into the tubing.  (I use a little dropper that comes with my daughter's medicine, drop it into the tube, & swing the tube over my head in the front yard like a lasso/crazy person.  It is quite a sight to see, but it works!)Some features that I love about this pump:-this is a double pump, but there is a plug that allows you to close 1 pump slot & only pump on a single side.-the ""let down"" technology is wonderful.  I had an older model Pump in Style & when you turned it on, it just went to town! It pumped so hard & so fast.  It was not nearly as effective.  With the ""let down"" technology I know that after 2 minutes I will really begin seeing how my daughter drinks.  It ""pulls"" correctly & does not just suck the air in & out.-there is an option to use a battery!  this is a great option when I have been on a long car trip & have needed to pump (especially if I find myself leaking unexpectedly).-the storage with this bag & with the travel ice pack is perfect.  I can't imagine needing more space.-the strap is actually long enough to put over your shoulder.  nothing is more annoying than a bag with a strap that you have to carry that bangs into your legs.  the nice long strap on this bag is perfect.-you will get every accessory you could need with this pump.  there are no unexpected purchases with this pump, it is ready out of the box.There are only TWO things that I wish were included with this pump:-the flexible shields. The hard plastic shields that are included with the pump are uncomfortable for me.  I purchased flexible shields.-a bottle-holder.  My Swing pump came with a small bottle holder that keeps the bottle upright when I am done pumping.  I LOVE that item!  When I pump with my Pump-in-Style I am always concerned that my bottles will tip over while I am trying to get readjusted, unhooking the hoses, unscrewing the shields, etc.  Giving us 2 of those bottle holders would be amazing.All in all, this is a top-quality pump.  Like I said, there is a reason why Medela pumps are so popular.",5,1

Baby Jogger 2013 City Select Stroller with Second Seat - Onyx,"I absolutely love this stroller! I originally purchased the phil and ted double stroller. It was great as a single, but as soon as I had my 2nd baby I hated it due to lack of storage space, popped 2 tires in 2 months and my daughter hated sitting in the back seat. So then I found this stroller and wished I had got it in the first place.My favorite things about it is the variety of seat configurations, great storage space, narrow profile so it is perfect for taking to the mall. The ONLY thing I don't like about it is that it is pretty heavy, but I think all high quality double strollers are heavy.",5,1
"Boon Glo Nightlight with Portable Balls,White",I bought it for my granddaughters for Christmas.  They wanted a night light and this one looked fun.  The lights change color if you want or stay in one color.  They love it.  They had it for about a week and one of the lights stopped working.  I contacted Amazon and they had a new one in less than 2 days and this one works perfect.  The product and the service so far have been outstanding.  Thank you.,5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Bib, Dog","We have the matching backpack, and are equally happy with that. This is the perfect addition to the baby bag (and now the purse I've switched to). I keep it in the folded state in my bag and then after use, I put it back like that and don't have to worry about any of the food remnants messing up my bag until I get home to launder it. I'm surprised that the thin material protects my toddler's clothes, but it really does work well. It's better than carrying her bulkier food bibs that don't fold up. I've never had a problem with the width but if you have a larger toddler, you may find that it may not cover their entire front.Cleaning it is easy. Just throw it in the washing machine and allow it to air dry. It dries very quickly and has never stained, even with blueberries. It has also not shown any signs of wear after 3-4 washes per month (we only use it when going out to restaurants but wash after every use).",5,1

"timi &amp; leslie Rachel 7-Piece Diaper Bag Set, Black","FTM here - looking forward to having this baby in a few weeks, but also looking forward to rockin' my new diaper bag! I haven't been working during this pregnancy, so I have been analyzing and over-analyzing every single product that we plan to use in our parenting.After decided to get just one gender-neutral bag for my husband and I to share, I was given a surprise shower and we received a really awesome dad-bag! It is perfect for my husband and just what we'll need for more adventurous excursions with baby.In the meantime, however, my husband convinced me to go ahead and splurge on a girlier bag for myself, since I will have primary care of the baby and carrying this bag around on a daily basis. After checking out bags in stores and online, I decided against childish patterns and colors (you know the ones I'm talking about!) and opted to look for something a little more mature while still functional and feminine.Which brings me to timi & leslie. Not all of the review on their bags are great. But the reviews on the Rachel bag were - so I decided to go for it. And with free returns on Amazon, how could I not give it a shot? I considered the red color but went with the taupe - it's still very rich and I think goes with more. The day I received the shipment, I immediately unpacked, prepped, and filled this baby up. I love a good shoulder bag, a good messenger bag, and a good designer bag - I basically keep a collection that fill those needs. But a diaper bag that fills all of them? AND will keep every single baby item I need organized and close at hand? Seriously - this bag does it all, and comes with every accessory you'll need to boot.Since I got this bag a few weeks ago, I've been using it as my regular large purse, opting for a smaller clutch when I don't need so much. Oh, and by the way? I still have 3 weeks to go before we actually use this as a ""diaper"" bag. timi & leslie - you have made me one happy mama-to-be!",5,1

"Infantino Renew Car Seat Cover, Chained Up","This cover fit my Graco car seats perfectly - soft fabric. I have purchased much more expensive covers in the past and this one seems like a comparative bargain. The only difference is the two vertical slits that the straps fit through are Velcro from top to bottom, not several costume stitched holes (for the various stages of growth of your kid) that matches the custom cover that comes with the seat. This means that the Velcro closes in a vertical line, whereas the straps enter in a horizontal one. Have yet to put my gestating newborns in it yet but I am happy with the purchase.",4,1

"Dream On Me 3&quot; Playard Mattress, White","Well, I suppose my baby girl should write the review since I've never slept on this mattress.  Since she's only 9 months I guess I'll have to do my best to write the review on her behalf.I've never slept in a Pack n Play, but looking at the standard &#34;mattress&#34; that comes with one I'd be willing to bet it's not the most comfortable sleeping surface ever.  I bought this Dream On Me mattress for a couple reasons:(1) the panels in the standard mattress that came with the pack n play kept shifting.  The design that allows the mattress to conveniently fold for travel also allows the panels to shift and &#34;bunch&#34;.  I kept looking at it thinking &#34;she can't be comfortable&#34;(2) we have the pack n play in our room right now because we co-sleep and the pack n play fits better than the crib.  since she is in the pack n play for more than just an overnight here and there when traveling, I felt like she deserved a better mattress.We have this Pack n Play: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Y9AKZI/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc;=1This mattress fits it perfectly.I like that this mattress is waterproof.  I still put a waterproof mattress pad on it as well (the mattress is quite firm, the mattress pad makes it just a little softer to sleep on) under the sheet.The mattress is nice and firm, she doesn't &#34;sink&#34; into it.One complaint, but I think the mattress pad is at fault here, not the mattress.  The playard mattress pad I purchased fits the standard playard mattress (that comes with the pack n play) but not this 3&#34; mattress.  So I had to improvise a little to make it work.  This is the playard mattress pad I have: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BPMJR6/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc;=1I know one &#34;pro&#34; my daughter would list is that the extra 3&#34; allow her to see over the top of the pack n play now.  She's very petite so without the mattress her eyes are behind the fabric at the top.  She had to try to climb the mesh if she wanted to look over the side rail, or she would have to crouch down and look through the mesh.  The 3&#34; are just enough to allow her to look over the side rails without climbing.I really have no complaints.  She doesn't seem to either.  I see no reason not to give this 5 stars.",5,1
"Dream On Me 3&quot; Playard Mattress, White",I'm still pregnant but I bought this for my Eddie Bauer soothe and sway pack n play. I just wanted to let everyone know that it fits perfectly.

"Dream On Me 3&quot; Playard Mattress, White","We are co-sleeping with our baby and our bedroom is quite small, so we decided to use the pack n play as her crib until she is too tall for it. The folding pad that came with the pack n play was really lumpy and was not even when laid into the bassinet insert. The Dream On Me mattress fit amazingly BETTER than the pad that came with the pack n play. It was slightly wider and longer which eliminated gaps on the sides. It is firmer than the folding pad too. This was what I was looking for. I am really happy with it.The only disadvantage was that the sheets I had that fit the folding pad were now too small for this one. The only one that DID fit was one that I bought from Buy Buy Baby. They brand is TL Care (tlcare.com) and it is the &#34;Natural Organic Cotton Fitted Pack-n-play Sheet. The Graco and BRU brands won't fit. I don't mind though, because the organic cotton is a jersey material and it is ridiculously soft I want to rub it on my face all day it's that's soft!Other than that, it was perfect for us.",5,1

"Dream On Me 3&quot; Rounded Corner Playard Mattress, White/Brown","I'm 8 month pregnant and decided to let my baby sleep in a Pack n Play since I have a small 1-bedroom apartment.  I really don't like the board that comes with my Graco Cuddle Cove PNP.  It's a thin board with some cushion that is too soft.  Since it's thin and fold-able, it does not stay well at the bottom of the bassinet and seems kind of bouncy because of its light weight.  After lots of research I decided to give this mattress a try.The mattress just arrived today and I'm very pleased with it. It measures 38x26 (The other Dream on Me mattress measures 38x24. That's probably why some reviewers stated that the mattress didn't fit their PNP. They didn't get the right one). The rounded corners of this mattress make it a perfect fit to the PNP, even better than the original board.  The mattress is made of polyurethane foam covered with plastic-like cover which makes it water-proof and very easy to clean.  There's no odor at all and although it says ""extra-firm"", it really is not that firm.  It's soft enough but provides sufficient support in my opinion. I'd give it 5 stars if it's a bit firmer.I also bought theAmerican Baby Company 100% Organic Cotton Interlock Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, Natural, which is very soft and comfortable, but too thin, stretchy and easily wrinkled. To make the mattress safer and free from hazards, I added a layer of cotton bath towel and usedThe ORIGINAL Bed Band. Adjustable Fastener/Holder/Strap/Suspender/Gripper for Your Sheets. Patent Pending.to make the cover more absorbent and tightly fitting (see photos).  I'm finally satisfied with my bassinet and can't wait to see my baby sleep in it.",4,1

"Dream On Me 3&quot; Foam Playard Mattress, White",I love it! This mattress is extremely firm. The size is perfect for my  cosco funsport playard and good quality.,5,1
"Safety 1st AdapTable High Chair, Cosmos Storm",I shopped all over the place for days for the perfect high chair. I wanted something that would work with an infant and be able to grow with her. The assembly was easy and the instructions were clear. I really like the design. It folds up and stores pretty well. I really like how it can be adjusted to so many different heights depending on where we will be eating. The seat also reclines for different sized babies. I think it's going to be really good for us but I will update if I see otherwise!,5,1
Happy Heinys ONE for ALL One Size Cloth Diaper with Snap Closure + 2 Microfiber Inserts (Aqua),"This diaper is perfect. Great fit for a one-size diaper, tight snaps, ability to crossover snap or not,tight leg elastics, wide back pocket for easy stuffing. I love it. I've bought three so far and as soon as I find more colors I like, I will be buying more!",5,1
"Summer Infant Babyshade Infant Car Seat Cover, Taupe",This is the perfect answer for just about any weather condition and allows for air circulation. It also helps keep strangers from touching him when we're out at the store or doctor's office. So great!,5,1
"MamaDoo Kids Foldable Play Yard Mattress Topper, Blue","Our duaghter slept in her pack n' play with no fuss.  it wsa no different than being in her crib.  Great idea, easy to transport, and fits perfect in the Graco Pacn n' Platy.",5,1
"MamaDoo Kids Foldable Play Yard Mattress Topper, Blue",Great product fits perfectly in the play in go. I needed more padding in the play in go so my daughter could sleep in when we travel.,5,1
"MamaDoo Kids Foldable Play Yard Mattress Topper, Blue","When my DS was an infant he HATED his bedroom and thus his crib. He forced my husband and myself into co-sleeping. He slept great in our bed but we didn't with him in it. So for about 6 months (from 8 months to 14 months) he slept at the foot of our bed in his pack and play and on his MamaDoo mat! What a lifesaver it was!!! I slept great knowing he was comfortable AND safe! Some have mentioned that it is too soft, I totally disagree! I think it is perfectly firm and soft at the same time! It has gone along on many trips and will again as his little brother is only 3 months old! We've used ours A LOT and it still looks like new. I am sure that when we are done using it we will be able to pass it on in like new condition!",5,1
"MamaDoo Kids Foldable Play Yard Mattress Topper, Blue",Our baby sleeps in this play yard a lot and this topper is just a perfect fix for a standard super hard bottom that it comes with. I even managed to pull a waterproof mattress pad over it (although it wasn't easy). I washed the covers once with no issues. Honestly i dunno how kids can survive without it.,5,1
Prince Lionheart Versa Formula Mixer,"I've been using this for about a month, and it is worth every penny! I use the formula mixer attachment. It works great for making single bottles of formula. My son gets about 4 ounces of formula a day right now, so this is perfect for us. If I were exclusively formula feeding I think I'd get the Dr. Brown's pitcher mixer. This produces formula with no clumps (which means no clogged nipples)! It's easy to use, easy to clean, and inexpensive. I'm very happy with my purchase.",5,1
"green sprouts 7 Ounce Silicone Bowl, Green","It's not easy to find something non-toxic since most baby things are made of plastic. It's non-toxic and it's good size, perfect!",5,1
"Tommee Tippee Anti Collic Bottle, 5 Ounce, 2-Count","I've used nuke, similac and tommee tipee bottles. Tommee tipee is the best so far for feeding without chocking. My baby is totally bottle fed so there's no problem of switching nipples of different bottles. She can take any shape of the nipple, including this one, which is very different from the nuke bottles. We used nuke for almost 3 months before switching to tommee tippee. Now we use all three types of bottles in turn.pros: having a heat senser for temperature. So it saves you from guess work; a valve to reduce air bubble, so it reduced colic at night.cons: you got to make sure after every cleaning and resembling the nipple flushes with the ring of the lid, otherwise the nipple sucks back during the feeding.The odd shape of bottle neck not fits into the bottle warmer perfectly so water comes up.",4,1
Backyard Birds Night Light,Very pretty night light. I like that it's made from an aged looking metal. Different from others I've purchased in the past. Worked perfectly for my location.,5,1
"BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Booster Seat, Gray/Black/Green","To the reviewer who said it does not stay open when set-up, they must be doing something wrong. In order for this to work correctly, you have to make sure you pull the straps tight enough to flatten the chair. I love this. Didn't even know they existed until my mother told I should look for one. I recently went on a trip to visit family and this was perfect for my 13-month son to use. It cleans very easily is compact enough to fit in my luggage without taking up a lot of space.",5,1
"BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Booster Seat, Gray/Black/Green","I was a little taken aback when I first removed this seat from the packaging, because it just didn't look like it would work. It has this flimsy looking fold that looks like it would collapse under any movement. I was pleasantly surprised. We used this for our 23 lb 14 month old for a road trip. It was perfect. It folds to nothing and is super light. My son was leaning and grabbing and the seat never faltered. It fit every hotel room chair we tried. I knocked off one star, because the clips for the strap that hold the travel seat to the seat of the chair are located in the middle. That means that one has to basically be on the floor, under the chair, in order to fasten the clip. It is hard enough for a parent with a toddler to maintain any dignity in a restaurant setting without beginning the affair by rolling around on the restaurant floor.",4,1
"BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Booster Seat, Gray/Black/Green",We used this on vacation so that we wouldn't have to have a high chair. Our daughter was 19 months old then. It was perfect. We've also used it since then when visiting friends and going to restaurants. It's sturdy and made well. My daughter likes sitting in it. Seems like good quality. It's really light and travels easily.,4,1
"BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Booster Seat, Gray/Black/Green","I have one year old twin boys, and we recently took them to visit their grandparents in California.  I looked at various travel high hair options online. Most of the options I found were the soft,tie on variety. I came across the Brica Fold N' Go Booster by chance, and thought it looked like a more comfortable choice. We had it shipped straight to CA and I was a bit nervous, not having seen the boosters in person before the trip. I needn't have worried. The seats are perfect! They're sturdy enough for my 25 pound kiddos, and see comfortable too. They secure easily and safely to the kitchen/ dining room chairs, and allowed the boys to be at a comfortable level to eat from the table with everyone else.We brought both boosters back I one suitcase. They're very light and portable. We whipped them out again at a friend's barbecue last weekend, and they were the envy of other parents there.Nice job, Brica!",5,1
"BRICA Stay-In-Place Baby Mirror, Black","This mirror works like a charm. It's plastic so it won't break, but the reflection looks like glass. I can see many son perfectly and he can see me. I bought one for each car.  I highly recommend it!",5,1
BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Bassinet,the product arrived in perfect condition and atime.It is as I expected and really is extremely practical for the baby.,5,1
BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Bassinet,"We bought this for our 6th child. He slept nights downstairs on the couch (using a baby moniter) in order to avoid waking his 5 sleeping siblings. This bassinet was perfect!  I could quickly fold it and store it behind the couch during the day and whip it out at nighttime. I loved having my own space downstairs to tend to our baby's needs without disturbing anyone else. I could turn on lights, watch a short show (to keep me from falling asleep sitting up in the chair), change him while he cried and none of my family woke up.  During the day he slept upstairs in the crib. He is just now growing out of it (4 1/2 months). I highly recommend this portable bassinet.",5,1
"BRICA Kick Mats (2 pack), Black","Works perfectly in my Mini Cooper.  Straps Velcro around the top head rest bars, and elastic around the base. I don't have to worry about the kids feet on the back of the seat, so I'm a happy customer!",5,1
Bearington Baby Lil Giggles Monkey Ring Rattle,Of course nothing can be wrong if it's monkey!  My daughter loved the theme and the rattle was a perfect addition to her collection . My grandson is now 12 days old but I am sure he will love it just as much given the time to grow.,5,1
"BRICA By-My-Side Safety Harness Backpack, Blue",I have a wild and adventurous one year old and this backpack is amazing.  I received it very quickly.  It fits my average sized toddler perfectly and she loves to wear it.  The back is big enough to hold a couple diapers and a ziplock of wipes.  The strap detaches easy and has some stretch to it.  It made my day at the zoo so much better!,5,1
"Carter's Memory Book, Wonder","I was looking for the ""right"" baby book and this is just perfect. Everything it is fantastic - the design, the paper, etc. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking or a baby book.",5,1
"Carter's Memory Book, Wonder",Bought two books for twins. Each baby can now have their own &#34;life information&#34;. Books are very nice and will be used for many years to come. The layout is perfect for any information you may want to put in the book.,5,1
"C.R. Gibson Memory Book, Baby Bots","My mom actually found this in the hospital gift shop and it could not be any more perfect. All the space for photos, baby shower stuff, firsts, monthly updates, etc. so adorable and really nice quality. I have gotten countless compliments on it - now if I can just keep up with the constant updates I'll be good to go!!",5,1
"C.R. Gibson Memory Book, Baby Bots","Love it! Perfect for my son due in November. Has a place about parents, how they met, family tree, a page for every month up to 12 months, and MORE!!! Couldn't be happier!! Lots of places for pictures as well :)",5,1
"C.R. Gibson Slim Bound Journal Album for Photos, Happi Baby Girl",she will always know she had the owl collection as a baby and toddler book arrived in perfect condition no complaints.,5,1
Custom Baby Bedding -Jungle Animal 15 PCS Crib Bedding,"I would recommend this to anyone! It is so cute and perfect for my little Maddie! The only thing extra I am doing to it is adding a little more stuffing to the pillows. I am truly amazed I got all this for that price! The material rocks, so soft, and so many different textures, and vibrant colors! A definite win on my part!",5,1
Mary Meyer Okey Dokey 17&quot; Dino Baby Blanket,"I bought all the Mary Meyer Dino blankies, and wubba nubbs. They are just too cute. This Dino Blankie is perfect size for little hands and has silk on the inside and soft fabric on the outside. My now 3 month old loves all his dino's.",5,1
"The Grandparent Gift Co. Sweet Something Frame, My Godparents",This is so cute and perfect for soon to be grandparents. I purchased for both sets of grandparents and they love it.,5,1
"BOB Single Snack Tray, Black","The tray do its job. It's high so my kids legs don't hit it, easy to put on and off, perfect for his sippy and snacks.",5,1
"BOB Duallie Snack Tray, Black",I give it 4 starts because I hated when I found out that my dual stroller doesn't come with that and that I needed to buy it separately. Otherwise perfect fit.,4,1
"North American Bear 12&quot; Velveteenie Circus Knotted Baby Cozie Plush, Lion","My five month old baby was having a hard time learning to sleep in his crib without being nursed to sleep so I bought this lion for him to use as a lovey.  It's perfect!  He can suck on the knots, snuggle into it, or hold the tail as he falls asleep.  The body is very lightly stuffed but not perfectly flat like a blanket so I'm not worried about it being a suffocation hazard.  It has worked exactly how we were hoping it would and the baby now falls asleep in a few minutes without fussing the majority of the time.  In fact, I just ordered a second one today as a back up for when the other one is in the wash!",5,1
"Quinny Zapp Xtra Travel Bag, Black",had a little issue at first and then need to break the seat down. it won't break. Perfect for the airport.,5,1
"Aprica Presto Flat Stroller, Jet Set Black","This stroller is by far the best lightweight stroller thus far. I purchased this for my 14 moth old daughter.. to replace my Chicco Cortina, which is huge and took up a lot of space. Compared to the Chicco Cortina, The Aprica flat has the following features which I love:-The seat is considerably higher, which makes my daughter happy because she can see more. It is also convenient when we go out to eat because I can just roll her up to the table.-There are 4 different reclines...from almost 90 degrees to almost lying down...doesn't recline as flat as the Cortina, but pretty close. It does sit up straighter than the Cortina. The recline mechanism is the same on both the Cortina and Aprica, utilizing a lever.-The basket underneath is substantial for a lightweight stroller...Plus when the seat is completely reclined, you can still access the basket because the seat is set higher. With the Cortina, once the seat is fully reclined, you cannot access the basket.-The fold is pretty easy. Read the directions and follow them closely. Once you get the hang of it, it's not bad at all.-It takes up a third of space compared to the Cortina...and is a lot lighter.-For being a lightweight stroller, the Aprica does not tip when I hang my heavy JJ Cole diaper bag and other bags on the handle. Amazing!!!! I added a Diono buggy buddy and a JL Childress side mesh bag...PERFECT!!!!-The leg rest can be put in 3 positions...all the way up to 90 degrees, straight out, or all the way down as pictured.Other things worth mentioning:The canopy was not as big as I had hoped, but much more substantial then the Cortina. The canopy does not rotate. The Aprica steers pretty well, but not as smooth as the Cortina...obviously because it is a lightweight stroller. My daughter loved the padding on the Aprica. Super soft. Both the Aprica and Cortina can be converted to a 3 point or 5 point harness. Overall I love the Aprica because it had all the features I was looking for and was a lot more portable. The height of the seat really did make a difference because my daughter was able to see more and enjoyed sitting in her stroller!!! Fell asleep every time:)!",5,1
Metal Wall Decor Butterfly Sculpture 29x15,"This is the very first thing i ever ordered online and did not have the opportunity to hold in hand to examine before purchase. I wasn't sure what to expect, but was figuring it would probably be junk and end up in a garage sale. I was so excited to see it wasn't and that its quality actually exceeded what I could have bought at our local stores. I love it and it fits perfect in the place i ordered it for.",5,1
Metal Wall Decor Butterfly Sculpture 29x15,"This was for the outside wall of the shed that faces toward the front. My wife just loves it, and it was accompanied with 4 other butterflies that we bought just makes it perfect.",5,1
"NUK Trendline Silicone Spout Learner Cup, Blue/Orange Dots, 5-Ounce","This is the perfect sippy cup for your transitioning littler one! It was seamless to go from bottle to sippy and unlike many others, this one truly is spill proof!",5,1
OsoCozy Flushable Diaper Liners,"These are great liners!  They are a bit big for my BG 4.0s so I cut them in half width-wise and store them in a disposable wipe container. They are perfect as-is for my prefolds and when I'm using those I keep them on the roll (they are on the roll in a way that you are able to use every liner).  They catch solids and flush easily, making changes so much faster and cleaner.  I throw them in the trash if it's not a poop diaper and they don't stink, which was a concern of mine in the beginning.  Get these!",5,1
"Jahgoo Bath Support Baby Bath Seat, Lime","I love cool baby things and was looking at the Boon bath, among others. I couldn't quite justify spending $50+ dollars on something as silly as a baby bath. .With my first three children I didn't even both with a baby bath, I just put them in the kitchen sink or held them in the tub; however, my fourth baby had surgery and for the first month or so was not supposed to be submerged in water.  I needed something to basically act like a third hand for me; offering support for the baby, and this fit the bill. Obviously I wouldn't leave a little one alone in this,  you MUST keep a hand on your child; it is a little hard, but I just put a hand towel in the seat and it was fine. I wouldn't use it for extended periods of time, just long enough to get the baby in and out of the bath.  Plus it doesn't take up much space, I can easily stick it in the closet when I'm done. Perfect.",5,1
"Jahgoo Bath Support Baby Bath Seat, Lime","With my first daughter I bought a huge bathtub and she was constantly slipping around.  We both ended up hating bath time.  With my second daughter I bought this seat.  She just loves this!  We both enjoy bath time so much.  It sits perfectly in the tub, never slips and it even has a little drain in the bottom to let dirty water flow through so she is constantly sitting in clean water.  It probably won't last long because it is small (baby will grow out of it soon)but it is so inexpensive it is worth it for the first few months.",5,1
"Graco Blossom 4-In-1 Seating System, Sapphire","This is best the high chair! Most of my son's big ticket items were purchased with the intention of having good quality, design esthetics, longevity and can grow with him over time. This chair embodies all of those items in one. The removable back insert worked wonderful when my son was smaller and needed to be closer to the table. With most beginning eaters, they tend to make large messes so, having the option to remove it made cleaning easier. When he turned about 10 months, we removed the back insert and he seemed really comfortable with out the extra padding because the back of the chair was sturdy but soft. The tray(s) are wonderful. There is a base tray that is smaller with a cup holder, a main tray which is really wide and a removable top tray that also has a build in cup holder. All trays are easy to clean and put together. The seat has different reclining positions which make eating and cleaning easier. The chair can be adjusted to many heights making it easier to lower as my son gets taller.The best part about this high chair is the seat. We have taken the padded part with the tray on several trips but, recently, we have only needed the booster. The table does not attach to the booster but, the booster is easier to travel with. The booster's back can be detached and when needed, the booster can be strapped to any chair. We've even had his cousin sit the high chair while my son sits in the booster. Perfect with families with more than one kid. The only down sides are that the base cannot be folded for easy storage when guest come over and the foot rests are still too low for my 16 month old to reach but, none of these matter since the benefits out way all the negatives. This learning chair, high chair and booster will take our son from infancy all the way to preschool. Best investment we every paid for.",5,1
"Graco Blossom 4-In-1 Seating System, Sapphire","I have been using this for about 2 months and i don't think I have any complaints. It's easy to get my daughter in and out of. The tray has never given me a problem or fallen off. It moves around easily. It fits perfectly in the corner. I like all the adjustment options. The button that releases the straps gets stuck a little but that is about it.My only suggestion is not to pick which one you want based on the pattern because that is only on the removable pad. So unless your child is quite young or very small, you'll be taking it out almost immediately and then it's just cream.",5,1
"Prince Lionheart Flexibath Foldable Bathtub, White","perfect for our three year old. It folded up nicely in our suit case since we were going to a home with no bath tub.We use it in our own home as we, too, don't want to fill the whole tub for our little guy.",5,1
"Prince Lionheart bebePOD Flex Plus Baby Seat, Green/Kiwi",Both my kids loved this little chair. They could sit in it from about 3 months old and it would keep them entertained for a half hour or so while I did things around the house. I like how safe it is with the strap and the tray is perfect because it can have toys for them to play with or turn into a food tray. We used it to feed the babies before they could sit well in the high chair.  Plus it's small and doesn't take up much room like other baby gear.  I highly recommend it!,5,1
SnoozeShade Original - the breathable sleep and sun shade (UPF50+/max UV protection) for strollers,"I was lucky enough to receive my Snooze Shade as a sample, after seeing a friend from the UK using hers.Before I had it, I was using pegs (!) to hold down a black pashmina in a desperate attempt to shield my 5 month old from the sun (even in the winter), and allow him to sleep in his stroller. The Snooze Shade changed everything. It's small enough to keep in the basket underneath my stroller (Bugaboo Bee), and I just whip it out when he's tired and we're about to start walking. It fits perfectly, and stays securely in place. It takes about one minute to put it on. He is ALWAYS asleep within minutes. I couldn't live without it now, and am so relieved I sorted the problem before summer!",5,1
SnoozeShade Original - the breathable sleep and sun shade (UPF50+/max UV protection) for strollers,"I had been looking for something like this for quite a while!  It fits my bugaboo just perfectly and allows my little guy to get some sleep while we are out and about!  The mesh material allows air in, while keeping the light out.  The interior of the carriage also stays nice and cool.  This works sooo well that he was able to snooze his way through a trip to the McDonald's playland with big sister!  Love it!",5,1
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Classic Pooh","It seemed to be in the beginning it wasnt very stable , but now i know, its perfect, very stable and very comfortable.The thin, the table by itself doesnt attach very tight. it seems a lot unstable.",5,1
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Newborn Napper, Classic Pooh","Graco did wonderfully when they created this pack and play. Not only is it super cute, but its worth every penny as it is functional from birth on up through each stage! The newborn napper is a perfect place for the brand new little one and I love the changing station, makes it very convenient to keep the baby in your room rather then a nursery. The bassinet will suit an infant just fine for some time and the playyard is perfect for a toddler as a safe place to play. We have all boys and there has never been any cute patterns to pick from like there are for girls, but finally there is a cute pattern that works either way! We are very pleased with this purchase!!",5,1
Medela Harmony to Symphony Conversion Kit,I bought this conversion kit for a pump that we are provided at work.  It is perfect and works great.  My only complaint is that there was only one in stock and I needed two.  I use this everyday and works like a champ!,5,1
"Kushies Waterproof Bib, Blue Circle, Infant","I love these bibs!  They can be washed over and over (i wash mine at least once a day, sometimes twice) and the velcro is still good as new.  They also can be stuffed into corners of bags and brought with me anywhere.  And, that's what inspired me to buy these bibs - going on a trip for a week and i didn't want to have to drag a week's worth of bibs with me and keep them dirty in a bag for a week.  They were the perfect solution!  I have two and i almost never use any other bibs.",5,1
"Luvable Friends Fitted Crib Sheet, Blue Circle","Fits the crib mattress perfectly, super cozy and soft right out of the package.  I bought the same brand in 2 different patterns so I would have enough to rotate or have a backup.  Didn't shrink with washing, I am very happy with this purchase!  Much better price for a good soft sheet than my local stores have.",5,1
kateaspen Born to be Wild Animal Candles,"I got these as decorations/ party favors for my baby safari animal-themed baby shower & they are every bit as cute as in the picture.  They are on the small side though, I'd say the base is about the size of a tea light.  They were adorable & went perfectly with the Kate aspen place card holders & the rest of my party decor!",5,1
"Boon Water Bugs Floating Bath Toys with Net,Orange","My son has always loved bath time ever since he was a newborn...however for the last 2 weeks he has been crying the minute I said bath time..so i decided to get him some new bath toys to make it exciting again...I have always been a huge fan of boon both for their design and for their quality and looked at their selection of bath toys, I got him this and the bath tub appliques and they are both so much fun! The net and floating water bugs keep him entertained and he loves scooping them out of the bubbles in the tub..it's a perfect size and looks sturdy made and I love the fact that there are no holes for yucky stuff to grow inside, clean up is super easy...my son loves this toy he says &#34;scoop scoop&#34; and when we're done he says goodnight net goodnight bugs...I would easily recommend this or give it as present...we love it",5,1
"Boon Stash Multi-Room Organizer,White",Perfect size to organize baby products in the bathroom.  Everything has it's own space and it's all easy to access with the slant design.,5,1
"Boon Lawn Countertop Drying Rack, Green","We just had our first baby and were putting bottles on paper towels on the counter to dry. It was unsightly and probably not too clean either. I looked for a better solution and came across this. I bought two which is perfect for the number of bottles we have (I'd recommend two). It looks great and functions perfectly. The grass is sturdy so you can hang stuff off the side blades if you want. I've been using them for a couple weeks now and very little water gets trapped underneath, meaning you won't have a bunch of stale water sitting around. I'd recommend this for any new (or not so new) mom.",5,1
"NUK Gerber Graduates Learning System Sports Learning Cup Tumbler, Baseball, 9-Ounce","Never leak, easy to clean. Spouts are a great transition from normal sippy cups to regular cups. Fun designs, perfect for our son. Oh and very durable, they have survived many falls and are still holding strong.",5,1
"Kids Line Quilted Fitted Crib Pad, White","This cover fits perfectly on my crib mattress. I've washed the covers several times and it is still is great shape. I purchased 2, to have a backup, knowing if anything leaked through the sheet and onto the pad, I'd need to change both before putting my daughter back to sleep...obviously laundry isn't always convenient depending on the time of day this could happen :)",5,1
"Kids Line Espresso Wooden Letter, A",The color is nice and even without any damage or nicks. Easy to hang via the hanging hardware included. Perfect for a child's nursery,5,1
"Kids Line Espresso Wooden Letter, A",I purchased all the letters for my daughters name and it looks just beautiful. The wood is quality & the color is perfect. I would highly  recommend this l line of wooden letters.,5,1
"Carter's Wildlife Hamper, Beige","Perfect for the baby's room, but also loved by the 3 year old big brother. May have to buy another. Good quality  practical",5,1
"Zutano Elephants Crib Fitted Sheet, Green/White",Love the pattern and the colors in it.  Goes perfect with my jungle theme!  I also bought the matching changing pad cover and I love that even more!  Sheet fits good and I've washed it about 4 times and have not had any stretching or shrinkage.  Great sheet!,5,1
"Zutano Owls Infant Towel and Washcloth Set, Pink",This is so cute and cuddly.  The owl motif was a hit at the baby shower.  And the pink highlights just perfect for a baby girl!,5,1
"Kids Line Dena Happi Tree Embroidered Boa Blanket, Pink","Beautiful addition to the Owl decor. Really nice, warm and cozy. Baby loves it. Fits the crib perfect. Highly recommend this item.",5,1
"Kids Line Dena Happi Tree Lamp Base and Shade, Pink","Loved this lamp !  It's cuter than the picture.  It literally brightened the nursery.  Very sturdy base, colors on the lamp shade and trunk are very bright and pretty. I would recommend this as a perfect addition to any nursery.",5,1
Zutano Elephants Valance,I purchased two of these to complete our nursery!  The colors are gorgeous and match the colors of the bedding and other Zutano Elephants accessories perfectly!  Highly recommend these if you are on the fence!,5,1
"Kids Line Dena Happi Tree Velour Changing Pad Cover, Pink",This changing pad is so cute and perfect for a sweet little girl.  It's made with good material & it's still in good shape after many uses & washes.,5,1
Hevea Panda Teether,"This bear has become our favorite teether. The rubber turned out to be an acquired taste for my baby - for the first week or so he'd grimace and reject it when we offered it to him. But he got used to it, and now it's our go-to teether. The shape and thickness is just right: no matter which part of the panda ends up in Baby's mouth, it works. And it seems to be the perfect texture and firmness. There's a little bit of give to it, but it's firm enough to stand up to even vigorous teething.  When I help my baby hold it in his mouth, I can feel the vibration of his gums working it. He'll chew on this teether longer than on other teethers, both the squishy gel and hard plastic or wood types. I also like that it's one solid piece, and the fact that there are no plastics or paint gives me peace of mind. Recommend!",5,1
Baby Jogger Carry Bag,"I used this bag to check my City Mini on a trip from Hawaii to the East coast. I am really impressed with the quality of the bag. The fabric is tough like a standard piece of luggage would be. The zippers are high quality too, tough. They added some convenient features to the bag such as an extender zipper to make the bag larger, a very nice shoulder strap and some roomy interior pockets too. I was able to fit in my Peg Perego infant car seat adapter and a whole pack of diapers into the bag as well as the stroller. The stroller was in perfect shape when I arrived. I'd highly recommend this bag! I only wish I could find one like this for my BOB Revolution duallie.",5,1
Postpartum Support Girdle Belt w/zipper Support Belly Band Medical-Grade Compression Bellefit,"I bought this to help me get back to my normal size after birth. I waited two weeks pp to start wearing it for comfort purposes. I am now three months pp and still wear this practically every day. I was 175 before delivery and am now 145. This girdle is holding up perfectly, it makes me feel comfortable in my clothes, and along with diet and exercise, it has and is helping my stomach return to its previous shape and size.",5,1
Postpartum Support Girdle Belt w/zipper Support Belly Band Medical-Grade Compression Bellefit,"After doing MUCH research regarding postpartum girdles which included talking to friends/other mamas, reading reviews online, and even watching youtube videos of success stories, I selected this product: the Bellefit Support Girdle w/Zipper.  It arrived VERY quickly and the size was perfect.Note: I used the online sizing calculator at 37 weeks and was as honest as possible.  Pre-pregnancy I was a size 4, 127 pounds with about a 27 inch waist and 36 inch hips.  At 37 weeks, my weight gain was 33 pounds and my hips had grown to 38 so a Medium was what I selected. Make sure that you definitely go with the size that they recommend; even though I was used to wearing a small in other support or shapewear products, the medium fits perfectly so that I could use it upon first coming home from the hospital.  I already plan on ordering a small so that I can transition to that as the weight loss continues-I'm amazed how quickly that has been!I cannot say ENOUGH great things about this girdle-way more comfortable than I ever thought it would be, easy to use and get on, and definitely a better option than those bands that simply go around your waist/hips; a friend gave me one and I tried it out while I was washing my Bellefit one day and I CONSTANTLY had to keep pulling it down as it was riding up.  This is NOT how you want to spend your postpartum days :-)  Get the Bellefit Belt, you will not regret it and you will be thrilled with how fast you start to see your ""old body"" come back! As a runner and 5X a week gymrat, I am absolutely ecstatic that I will be able to return to my pre-pregnancy weight ASAP thanks to this invention.",5,1
Melissa &amp; Doug Bella Butterfly Snack Container,"The snack box is really really cute. It perfect to put in 3 items. It not ideal for sandwiches, but good for fruits and other snacks.If you want to see a smile on your daughters face buy it! She will love it.Great buy for kids snack.",5,1
"Kids Line Lamp Base and Shade, Miss Monkey","We wanted a softer light in the nursery and this is perfect.  We also have the mural, hamper, blanket and some monkey curtain tie backs, so adorable.",5,1
Nuby Infant Nail Clipper,"Before we ordered these clippers, we were using regular adult-size nail clippers on our baby boy. When I was choosing nail clippers, I wanted something cost-effective, and these totally fit the bill. Just tried them out on our sleeping 7-month-old and they worked so perfectly I feel ridiculous that we waited so long to order them. I should have bought them seven months ago!",5,1
"Baby Brezza One Step Baby Food Maker, White/Grey","I'm not a mother, just a person who enjoys steamed and pureed single portions of food. I just got this today and I immediately tried it with broccoli and carrots, steam + blend for 25 minutes. Turned out perfectly! Once it was done, I added some seasonings and blended some more for a delicious side dish! I love that the steaming and blending occurs in the same place! Hand cleaning was very easy afterwards. The water chamber for steaming is a little annoying to dump out after each use, but doesn't take away from the overall awesomeness. I hope this product lasts a long time!",5,1
NoJo Reversible Water-Resistant High Chair Cover Pad,I have a Peg Perego Prima Pappa and the leatherette was starting to peel -- my son started to rip it and put it in his mouth. So I went online trying to find a cute--not too ""baby"" highchair cover and found this one.  Its sooo cute and fits perfectly and is washable etc.  We love it!!  Love how cushy it is and love the colors! Also love the two sided idea--my older two like to pick which side to use after I wash the seat.  Great product--I highly recommend it!,5,1
Disney Mickey Mouse Night Light,This night light is perfect for our new Mickey Mouse Clubhouse room for the kids.  They love turning it on before bed!,5,1
"OXO Tot Divided Feeding Dish, Aqua",I am a pretty big fan of OXO Tot because they are very thoughtful in their designs.Pros:- The color is great- The portions are perfect for a young baby- Love the no slip rubber bottom of the bowl- Very comfortable to holdCons:- The dish turned orange from the carrots and yams that my daughter eats out of it.,4,1
"OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2 Ounce, Set 6, Clear","perfect for fridge and freezer and hold right amount of food per feeding. love the lid and individual cups. i haven't try ice trays but these works fine and when my baby outgrow it, i can start freezing fruit cubes for the kids.",5,1
"OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2 Ounce, Set 6, Clear","I LOVE my regular size oxo containers so since I knew I wanted to make my own baby food when I found oxo baby food containers I had to have them. They are expensive BUT I almost bought a cheaper brands containers until I opened the box and the lids would not stay close! It is worth the expense to know the lids will work, you can keep it in the freezer, and they will last and last for a long time. They take up little room in the freezer and fridge using the tray and they stack which is perfect. I spent $100 on trays but I make enough baby food to last months which is cheaper in the long run than buying baby food weekly. This makes making your baby food so much easier.",5,1
"OXO Tot Straw and Sippy Cup Top Cleaning Set, Orange",OXO baby items are safe and functional. I love the interchangeable parts on all of the cups that we own. I highly recommend most OXO products and this is no exception. It works and fits perfectly for OXO sippy cups.,5,1
"OXO Tot Flip-In Hamper, Gray/Green","Super cute and easy to put together.  Perfect size, love the color and a great price.  Highly recommend for a child.",5,1
"Bumbleride 2011 Flite Lightweight Compact Travel Stroller, Jet","This is a review of the 2012 Bumbleride Flite in Ruby color. Our baby is 4 weeks now and we got the stroller shortly before she was born. It's our only stroller.We live in a city and I wanted a stroller with a small footprint both open and closed, that is also lightweight. Even smaller than the City Mini which is a popular stroller in our neighborhood. To me this meant an umbrella stroller. But I wanted to find one that we could use from birth.This stroller really fit the bill. The most similar stroller is actually the recent model Maclaren Quest, which also fully reclines.I only tried the Quest in the store so I don't have real world experience with it, but the Quest is definitely a better stroller in two ways: It folds more smoothly and uses a clever one-hand folding mechanism; and the recline uses a latch that you can also do with one hand, and goes even more horizontal than the Flite.The Flite folds and unfolds pretty easily but you have to get the hang of it. Once you're pro it is just possible to do with one hand but it's easiest with two. It folds very compactly, locks closed automatically (and unlocks automatically when you unfold), leans upright against the wall, and has a handy built-in carrying handle. You can toss it into the car without a thought. There was an issue in previous years where one of the folding bars could fold unexpectedly, but this issue is gone.The recline uses a draw strap so needs two hands, and doesn't go 100% flat; but it's flatter than a car seat, for example. The back actually goes quite horizontal, the issue is more that the seat bottom that supports the upper legs is angled up, and that you can't adjust (you can adjust the incline of the back and of the part that supports the lower legs of an older child). Bumbleride says it's safe from birth and we even mentioned it to a chiropractor who said if anything it's probably better to be a little inclined. I definitely recommend using a Snuzzler, not the little infant headrest that Bumbleride supplies. Most important, we used it with our newborn from 2 or 3 weeks and I can report that she's perfectly comfortable and cozy and falls right asleep as we stroll. Bumbleride used to sell a bassinet accessory for this stroller but it is practically a little bassinet already.I think the suspension works pretty well although it's hard to tell what you'd feel in the seat compared to what I feel in my arms as we stroll. It certainly maneuvers great and the small size is beneficial, I was even in a small bookstore the other day with her. You can stroll with one hand even on bumpy sidewalks. The light weight is great for curbs. We rolled up a big grassy hill in a park and it was fine. I imagine strollers with bigger wheels could be smoother on some terrains but I really don't think the kid cares, if anything she probably likes the movement. At some point you have to lift the wheels over big bumps, but this must be true of all strollers at some point.To me the bottom basket is plenty. The trick of course is to load it from the front. You can put a heavy blanket and a new package of diapers (not a case of course) in there at the same time.The canopy isn't huge but it's helpful. The peekaboo window works great when the seat is reclined, you look right down at her face. The rain cover (sold separately since 2012) is a nice one.The Flite seems to weigh more than the stated 14lbs as others have noted. I think it's between 15-16lbs, obviously with the wheels and canopy attached. But for all I know, all stroller manufacturers understate their weights. To me it does feel a little lighter than the City Mini and about the same as the Quest, which is in line with what their respective weights are supposed to be.The Flite's most unique feature is you can put a car seat in it. This the Quest can't do. This must be one of the most compact and lightest strollers with that feature. We first tried the Graco SnugRide Click Connect 35 and realized Bumbleride doesn't recommend this model; it sort of fits but not perfectly. Then we tried the Graco SnugRide Classic Connect 30 which fits fine, but we finally wound up with the Chicco KeyFit 30 which we really like and fits really snugly. When you close the carseat's canopy and the stoller's canopy, the baby can be completely enclosed except for a little crack on the sides. You can securely lift the whole stroller by the carseat's handle, handy for curbs. You do need to use the supplied strap to secure the carseat to the stroller. My one minor annoyance with the Flite is that, as you can imagine for a stroller like this, you need to remove the supplied carseat adapter bar to fold the stroller; and then there's no place to store the bar, it just kind of hangs around in the trunk of the car. I imagine some carseat and stroller or Snap-N-Go combinations (such as strollers made by car seat manufacturers) would be more convenient in that the car seat just snaps in/out and then you can fold the stroller, if you're going to be doing that really often; but we didn't find a stroller we liked that worked that way. It's by no means difficult with the Flite and many other stroller/car seat systems work the exact same way. In any case the car seat feature has been handy when we're actually driving someplace so we don't have to wake the baby to put her in the stroller and so she's enclosed more completely in there (such as a trip to the doctor followed by sleeping in the waiting room). We also wanted the feature because we thought the baby might not be cozy enough just in the stroller as a newborn; but after the first week or so we don't find ourselves using the carseat just for more support when strolling around the neighborhood, rather we put the baby directly in the stroller now so it's lighter to maneuver and simpler for us, and I think the baby likes having a little more space in there. On the other hand she turned out to be tall for her age at 2-3 weeks.Everything about the stroller feels both durable and friendly, from the aluminum tubing to the rubber parts to the straps to the fabric.Bumbleride's customer service seems excellent based on their Facebook page, one phone call I had with them to ask a question before the purchase, and another email exchange to ask another question after the purchase.The 2013 model apparently has a bigger canopy and a harness that is harder for toddlers to release, and that lets you detach the shoulder straps from the waist straps. I suppose that could be handy although we haven't had any difficulties with the Flite's harness.In the end we just liked the looks and feel of this stroller compared to the Quest, and the car seat feature. We've really enjoyed the stroller in practice, and so has the baby as far as we can tell! It is for sure a reliable way to put her to sleep. I strongly recommend it, I think it's a unique stroller if you're looking for this combination of qualities and features. Perhaps I will update this review in years to come after we've had a chance to try it on public transportation, and with the seatback upright once our daughter is older!",5,1
Mamas &amp; Papas Urbo Stroller - Black,"I just got new version of this stroller and I cannot say anything bad about it yet..I did a lot of research and tried out probably every stroller I had on my contenders list. My main requirements were : reversible seat, lightweight, used from birth (recline totally flat), adjustable back and foot rest, swivel wheels, easy to maneuver and reasonably priced. First of all after doing all the research I have decided that there's no perfect stroller (otherwise stroller manufacturers would not be able to come up with ""updated"" versions). After realizing that I made a list of MOST important things in the stroller. Ex. if I wanted it to be lightweight and compact it would probably mean less space for storage basket (now some of us cannot comprise that but I did).Of course it has some things I don't like but their are minor (like the back of the seat is plastic, I wish they would use some fabric on it or smth...but I can live with that).I knew each flaw of the stroller before purchasing it (small basket, plastic seat back, no accessories included)however for they were minor. I put the stroller together my self without the manual in less than 5 min, super easy fold, nice colors and it has everything I was looking for in a stroller.",5,1
"Green Eats 2 Pack Bowls, Blue","perfect size for growing kids...toddler to jr. high...cereal, and soup, ice cream,etc. dishwasher ease, and won't break when thrown (yes, they will!) on the floor.",5,1
"Green Eats 4 Pack Snack Plate, Blue","Love these! They are the perfect little snack plate for fruit slices or a few chips or a sandwich. They are small, but I don't think it is fair to ding them in reviews for that because the diameter is listed in the product description. To give you an idea, a sandwich on standard size bread would take up the whole plate. These would work better for toddlers with smaller portion sizes. I would not suggest using them at dinner for things like green beans and corn because my two-year-old ends up just sliding things off the plate (so we use the Green Eats bowls at dinner instead). We've had them six months and they've held up very well. They are dishwasher safe, which is a must for busy parents like us.",5,1
"Green Eats 4 Pack Snack Bowl, Blue","We got these for our 9 month old, and they are the perfect size for his portions. Dishwasher safe and unbreakable make them great choices for the multiple times a day that he eats.",5,1
"Green Eats 4 Pack Snack Bowl, Blue","Perfect size for snacks for my toddlers, very easy to hold & have held up well under their rough handling. Love that they are made from recycled materials. Going to buy some plates in this style next!",5,1
Parking Pal Car Magnet - Parking Lot Safety for Children (Flower Pal),"I slapped this on our car and it worked perfectly to keep my toddler in place while loading/unloading. Unfortunately, it disappeared after only a week or two. I contacted the company and got the following response with an offer for a 50% discount on a replacement:&#34;Our magnets are made is the USA and should stay on a vehicle during all weather conditions (snow, rain, wind, sleet) and during high speed travel. (However, it will come off in a car wash).My guess would be that it was stolen. The only solution I have for that would be to stick the magnet into your purse/diaper bag when walking away from the vehicle and stick it back on when returning to the vehicle. I have heard of some people who do this and it works well for them.&#34;I think that is great customer service that I wanted to share - though I did decide against a replacement until I move to a neighborhood where it's less likely to be taken again. I'd rather not deal with the hassle of removing it after every trip. Our window was recently smashed as well, for no apparent reason other than pure vandalism. Unfortunate that our experience with a great product was tainted by sub-par humans.",5,1
"Nuby BPA Free 4 Pack Fun Drinking Cups (Colors May Vary), 9 Ounce","The whole line of Fun Drinking Cups, Bowls & Plates come in assortment of bright fun colors and are the perfect size whether your child is just learning to eat by themselves or is an old pro like my 3 year old. They are extremely durable, and I love that they are ok to use in the microwave and top rack of the dishwasher.",5,1
"Nuby BPA Free 4 Pack Fun Drinking Cups (Colors May Vary), 9 Ounce",These are dish washer friendly and a perfect size for 3-5 Year olds. Most other cups I've found were too small or too large.My only criticism is they could have made them with a larger base instead of the extreme tapered design.,5,1
Zo-li Replacement Bot Straw with Brush (2 Straws 1 brush),"So glad this was available. If you have a Zo-li cup, you should buy this little set up.The replacement straws are clutch for when:&#8226; The original straw gets beat, battered and no longer stays closed off to prevent leaks&#8226; The original straw is just plain grossAnd eventually you're gonna want to clean that little straw out (for real clean it). The brush here is obviously perfect for that job - I can attest to that!",5,1
"Dr. Mom Finger Tooth Brush with Case, Green/White",This is a great product and I would recommend it to any parent... the size and design is perfect for you little one.,5,1
Little Giraffe Luxe Pillow - New Dot Trim,"Excellent product, super soft and cuddly, perfect for naps or long rides in the car.  Love Little Giraffe luxe products, there is nothing softer!",5,1
Disney Classic Pooh Together Time 2 Piece Canvas Wall Art by Kidsline,"I bought this for my grandboy's nursery and have yet to see it, but my daughter loves it!! She said it is really perfect for his Pooh room! Four stars because there was no hanger on the back of one, but they are sending one out for us to put on.",4,1
"Summer Infant Extra Camera for Best View Monitor, White","This monitor is perfect!  It has the night vision which you can see very clearly.  The one complaint I kept reading in the reviews was the volume was too low.  I have never used volume passed the first level.  You can hear EVERYTHING with this.  If it's higher then the 1st volume, you can even clearly hear the baby breath.  I love it and would recommend it to anyone.",5,1
"Kolcraft Lite Sport Lightweight Stroller, Blaze","When it says &#34;One-hand fold,&#34; unlike other strollers that boast this, the Kolcraft actually is a one-handed fold. It's lightweight, but it feels sturdy and safe. I can hold my infant in one arm, and collapse the stroller in another without killing myself. I have a baby who loves to sit up very straight, and often leans forward. And this stroller is perfect for that. It maneuvers well, I love the bar handle, the extended canopy, and the cup/tray pieces snap on and off easily. Also, assembly was ridiculously simple.This is a good choice if you aren't looking for a stroller where baby can nap, as the seat does not recline that much. I have a long day of air travel coming up in a couple weeks, and I'm relieved to have this lightweight stroller for layovers and down time. Yay! Couldn't be happier.",5,1
"Kolcraft Lite Sport Lightweight Stroller, Blaze","I absolutely love this stroller.  I used it for five years on many trips with my two children.  It is perfect for travel and airports as well as handy to have as a second lightweight stroller for trips to the mall, grocery store etc.  I much prefer this to an umbrella stroller which does not allow for much storage space underneath.  The one button flat collapse is just as good if not better.[....]",5,1
"Jeep Traveler Tandem Stroller, Spark","After searching for almost a year for the perfect double stroller I realized it does not exist.  However, this one comes really close.  I have a Honda Civic and my major concern was finding a stroller that would fit my small trunk.  This one does the job and I still have room for a few more items.  It rides smooth, easy to open and close.  I have a 4 month old and 16 month old and they love it.I have only had it for about a month and I already know I made the best choice. The only thing that I would add to it is trays for snacks.  The front seat has a cup holder and the toy but no room for a snack.  The back seat has no tray at all.  Other than that, for me, it is the perfect stroller.",4,1
Kids Line Winnie the Pooh Together Time 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"i love this bedding, it is perfect for a gender neutral nursery! the bedding is very soft, and the colors are a perfect classic pooh! very pleased with the bedding. i have not used it yet, but by looking at it and taking it out of the package i love it. VERY fast shipping as well!",5,1

"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow",This was perfectly priced and &#34;operable&#34; for the brief stay of my granddaughter this summer.She enjoyed it.  It's durable and I'll find a good home for it IF we don't need it for anotherbaby!,4,1
Tangerine Orange &amp; Fuschia Full Bed skirt,We bought this along with the Bacati orange and fuschia bedspread.  The bed skirt is a perfect match.  The colors in real life are a beautiful bright and vibrant tangerine.  The picture doesn't do it justice.  It's a must have if you're getting the bed spread.,5,1
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom",Have this camera for our newborn. Works great. Picture is perfect. Night vision works well. Don't use the music function. Talk back feature is great to communicate with wife. Would buy again.,4,1
"Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 2.8 Inch","I bought three monitors, no one is ""the perfect one"", some are good for the price, some are better than others because of the dimension of your home or the type of WiFi you're using. I think the best one (that I haven't tested yet) is the Motorola MBP36 but it sells for $239.Here some pros and cons of the ones I've tested:Lorex LW2451Pros:- Very good video quality- Very good infrared/night video quality- Very good video FPS (frames per second), very fluid video (like a professional security camera)- 3.5"" monitor- Charging Docking Station. The battery life is really good because you don't really think about it, when it sits on the station it's always charging (this is a big plus)- PTZ- Button to turn ON and OFF whenever you like to- Good and simple options menu- Good options- microSD for video recording- Video recording with button- Video recording with voice activation- Very good price- No interference with the WiFi (2.4Ghz or 5Ghz)- It works as webcam for Skype when connected to the PC via USB (I hoped it worked wirelessly as well but it doesn't, it's a big plus anyway. Extremely easy installation)Cons:- SOUND TOO LOW (best monitor I've had but this is a deal breaker. NOT SAFE! Wait for new model, hopefully they will change the microphone)- Voice activation (VOX) not working very well (since the microphone is not the best, sometimes you need too much noise and you can hear the baby from the room before than through the monitor)- Not too long power cable. Hard to mount high points on wallInfant Optics DXR-5Pros:- Very good price for the options you get- Good video quality- Very good infrared/night video quality- Good video FPS (frames per second), fluid video- Best voice activation (VOX) I've tried. This can also be annoying since it will turn on on every little movement during the night but I like to see the baby is safe every time he moves or every time he makes a noise, I really like this feature.- Best noise isolation I've tried- Extremely simple options (4 buttons total, very well explained)- Stand included (even if not needed in my opinion, the monitor is alreay designed to stand by itself)- Clip (my wife liked this, she was able to go outside with the monitor on her jeans all the time)Cons:- Awful battery life (constantly in charge)- No button to turn the video ON whenever you like to- It doesn't turn ON on VOX (someone may like this better?). It turns ON on ""always ON""- It literally kills your WiFi (this was my deal breaker with this monitor). I own an IT company and I install WiFi networks for companies, there was no way to get this to work with any channel and any router (I now have one of the best WiFi N900 routers installed, the ASUS RT-N66U). If you use 5Ghz band you will be fine but not every device has this possibility. I had to literally shut the monitor down to stream HD movies to my Boxee Box (no 5Ghz available on the Boxee Box), also unable to transfer files between laptops or iPhone- Not too long power cable. Hard to mount high points on wallMotorola MBP33Pros:- Very good video quality- Very good infrared/night video quality- Good video FPS (frames per second), fluid video (better than the DXR-5 but worse than the LW2451)- Amazing microphone, it is actually an external microphone like the ones you buy for computers, it also seem you get stereo audio from it. Just for this kind of microphone, the MBP33 is the safest monitor I've tested- No interference with the WiFi (2.4Ghz or 5Ghz)- When it goes off idleing, you can turn it on pressing any button. If you hurry when you hear something just press a button and look (awesome function)- Long power cable- It doesn't isolate the static noise of the room (the DXR-5 is the best for that) (changing this to a Pro feature. If you hear static you always know the monitor works and it's capturing audio also you can hear your son breathe.Cons:- No Pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) (you get that with $60 more, with the MBP36. I don't think this option and the VOX are worth $60)- No voice activation (VOX)UPDATE:The MBP33 stopped working about two weeks ago (we were oversea for vacation!), it lasted long time and speakers just break. I've opened it, tried to solder the speaker again, made a mess and Motorola didn't even blink. They, with Amazon, refunded me right away, no questions.I am ordering a new one, same model, right now and change the rating to 5 stars. The Motorola MBPxx It's the best monitor I've tested so far.",5,1
"Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 2.8 Inch","This monitor is exactly what I needed.  First one worked well, but sound failed after a few days.  Amazon to the rescue!  They shipped a replacement, which arrived in less than 48 hours, now working perfectly.  Amazon backing is BETTER than the factory warranty!",5,1
"Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 2.8 Inch","We had a Summer Infant Video Baby Monitor for about a year and a half and it finally basically just broke so we had to purchase a new one that had good dual camera function for our newborn to go along with our toddler.  There were two things that caught my eye about this one that the Summer Infant did not have:  1)  Temperature in the room, 2)  Intercom feature.  Some of you may not use those but I live in a large house when my baby wakes up it takes me a while to roll out of bed and get up there so I can just hit the intercom and say, ""I am on my way!""  My wife and I will sometimes converse on it as well if one of us is in the room.  Also, because his room is in the upstairs it gets hot up there when the main level is not.  We can always gauge this from the monitor and it is very accurate.-Battery Life:  Appears to be fine.  We charge it all night while it's on, turn it on during his 3 hour nap off the charger and then charge it again for the next night.  Definitely needs a FULL charge in order to make it for a 12 hour sleep, if you are lucky enough to have that.  There is a beep when the battery is getting ready to run out that happens twice.  If you are in the room with your controller you will hear it, but if you are out of the room, you probably aren't going to catch that.-Durability:  Has a kickstand so it can stand up on a table or the ground and that makes it easier to carry.  It is round and kind of slippery so it could fall out of your hand if you don't have the kickstand out.  After 4 months, this thing seems good as new.  We love it.-Range:  I was concerned about range when looking at the others but we have never had a problem with this one.  We live in a 3700 SF house with all SF basically even with each of 3 levels and we get great reception everywhere.-Video Quality:  Great during the day (or OK is probably the better term) and OK and night.  Definitely good enough.-Adding a new camera:  This was really easy to do.  Just plug in the other camera and it reads it immediately.  You can scan between the two so it will go back and forth every 10-12 seconds or keep it on one of the two cameras.-Features:  Brightness control, volume, standby mode, temperature in the room, zoom (which I never use) intercom.-Non-Feature:  the camera for this unit does NOT move via this remote and can only be moved manually.  What this means is that you need to have a space you are watching where the camera can be stable in one spot and gather all the image you need.  My last one had a camera that moved and that was a great feature.Overall rating:  8/10-Marks down only for no camera that moves and also that the rechargeable batteries that it takes are very odd ones that are hard to find.  Eventually this rechargeable battery will die (as they all do) and our last one took re-charagable AA's-easy to find and also compatible with other things.  Works perfectly with excellent range and very trustworthy and reliable.  It's a lot of money, but if you are debating on video vs. just audio-for your infant, video is the way to go for the comfort you want.",5,1

Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Twinkling Lights Projector Mobile,We went to many baby stores and looked for a mobile that would match our animal themed nursery. This seemed perfect. We are still waiting for the baby so we don't know if he will like it but I don't see why he wouldn't. The big animals light up and move up and down while the three little bees in the middle spin around. The animals light up at different times. For about a month now we have been turning it on to try it and it looks beautiful and it keeps working. We also like that there are different songs and everything is set up for the point of view from the crib. We looked at other mobiles that had animals and from the bottom you could only see the edges. With this one the faces of the animals are actually facing where the baby will be. We hope the baby likes it as much as the parents!,5,1
"Kids Line Carry All Printed Diaper Bag, Lime Ginko",I have to say when I ordered this I was rather afraid. I was pleasantly surprised I will say it is MUCH bigger then I thought it would be but now that my little guy is eating solids and we have to pack food its perfect the only draw back I have found with this bag is that the inside pockets don't have good enough elastic in them and tend not to contain the diapers/changing pad causing a slight jumble in the bottom of the bag if I don't pack it JUST so....but this bag MORE then makes up for thatpro's-the straps *not the detachable one* but the two handles are STILL long enough to sling over my shoulder when needed-the stroller straps/cart straps are easy and fast and make fitting everything & a baby in a shopping cart a LOT easier-I abuse it horribly and it STILL looks very clean-All the pockets are good size and shapes for bottles diapers ect.-the top can zip closed which is nice if its raining but I rarely remember to but it hasn't tipped and dumped on me once...even when my lil' guy pushes it over or uses it to pull himself up on it doesn't spill!,4,1
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink","Works perfect for hotels/motels/house for our toddler.  I think that this is a must for every trip!  Great job, Aqueduck!",5,1

Disney Friendship Pooh Lamp Base And Shade,"This lamp is the perfect addition to our son's room.  It is very cute, and with the large bee pull he has been able to use the lamp by himself.  The base is fairly heavy, so when he pulls on the bee it stays stable.  I would recommend this for any young Winnie the Pooh lover.",5,1
Disney Friendship Pooh Lamp Base And Shade,Perfectly cute. Great quality..Characters are 'as is'..meaning Pooh looks like Pooh..etc..I'm really funny about when characters are recreated and don't look exactly like their TV version..Bulb that comes with it is pretty bright..so if you're looking for a soft light for the nursery for night time feedings..you'll need to switch out the bulb to a lower wattage..,5,1
SheetWorld Round Crib Sheet - Dark Grey Jersey Knit - Made In USA,These sheets are well made and fit the round crib mattress perfectly. I love the gray color. It's definitely dark gray. The photo is pretty accurate (viewed on iPad). The color hints towards a warm (red) gray rather than a cool (blue) gray. If you're using gray in your nursery you'll know what I mean. Is amazing how many grays there are out there. This gray goes well with everything in our nursery. I'll try to post a picture.,5,1
Animals Alphabet Baby Nursery Peel &amp; Stick Wall Art Sticker Decals for Boys and Girls,I used one of the walls in my baby's room for these alphabets and its the cutest thing. I only used the capitals since they have pictures attached. I have bumpy walls but these decals hold up perfectly even after numerous times of repositioning,5,1
Animals Alphabet Baby Nursery Peel &amp; Stick Wall Art Sticker Decals for Boys and Girls,"These letters were perfect for our nursery. Everyone always asks if I got them at Pottery Barn...The only complaint I have is that they are shiny on the non graphic part, so you can definitely tell they are stickers if you look at them in the light.",4,1
"Bright Starts Start Your Senses Shake, Rattle and Swim","The colors, the shape, and the noises.  Perfect!

"Taggies Colors Blanket, Confetti","My kids always loved to ""feel"" tags when they were little. I saw this and thought it was the perfect, portable solution for my 5 month old granddaughter who is also starting to ""feel"" on things. Very soft. Not quite as big as expected, but big enough.",5,1

Bright Starts Clack and Slide Activity Ball,"This was my baby's first toy that he loved to play with by himself.  Perfect for the 5-9 month range.  He loves the colors and textures and moving the little rings on the spindles.A new baby doesn't need many toys, but this one is a must!",5,1

Chewbeads Necklace - Jane - Black,"It's the perfect combination of stylish and functional. I like it because it allows me to still wear accessories, and feel comfortable knowing my little one wont break it.",5,1
Chewbeads Necklace - Jane - Black,"The length is perfect, as is the color. It really does match everything. The only caveat is that the beads are rubbery in texture and it tangles all the hair at the nape of my neck! If they could somehow make the beads less rubbery, they'd be perfect. I would probably wear them even when none of my kids is teething :p",4,1
"24&quot; X 24&quot; X ~9/16&quot; Extra Thick Rainbow Play Mats (Set of 6): Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple",I have a 7 months old and its very helpful when he tries to sit or stand. The cushion is perfect,5,1

"Joovy Tricycoo Tricycle, Greenie",I purchased this for my daughter's first birthday. It was super easy to put together and she instantly fell in love with it. The only issue was that the handle bars came damaged with the plastic coating being split. I called Joovy customer service and was told a new part would be shipped immediately. About 5 days after purchase I received a new handle bar in perfect condition. I am very pleased with the customer service. I was able to get the new part just in time for my daughters party. We've used it twice since purchase and She loves it! Totally worth the money and so cute!,5,1
"Joovy Tricycoo Tricycle, Greenie","This turned out to be perfect for a little beginner. I purchased this for my 1yr. old granddaughter. It was easy to assemble and the perfect size.

"Sugarbooger Zippee! Lunch Tote, Dia De Los Muertos",I love my lunch bag.  I get so many questions about the &#34;scary looking skulls&#34;  so many people have no clue.  This is very durable and wipes up very well.  The price was perfect for what I was looking for,5,1
"Sugarbooger Zippee! Lunch Tote, Hoot",Love this lunch tote!  My 2nd grade daughter does too.  It is the perfect size to fit food and a thermos and it also provides great insulation.  We would recommend it!,5,1
"Graco Pack N Play Playard with Bassinet, Pasadena",Works beautifully for our needs. I bought one for my parents' house and one for my use in Alaska. Very portable and the fancy bells and whistles of the more 'deluxe ' product are simply not worth it to me. She can sleep the whole night through in it without issue. Very pleased with it. Color is fun but muted. Perfect.,5,1
"Graco SimpleSwitch Highchair and Booster, Pasadena",This gift for our kids met all my expectations and our kids'. The booster is perfect for any chair that has a fairly large base. The legs are easy to carry and install anywhere so you don't even need to use it as a booster unless you want to. The contemporary owl fabric delighted my daughter-in-law. Great value great product.,5,1
"Graco SimpleSwitch Highchair and Booster, Pasadena","These chairs were exactly what we needed when our twins started eating solids!  The reclining feature was just right when they weren't sitting up yet, and it comes apart quickly and simply which is perfect for taking the chairs with us to Grandpa's house once a week!  I really love how they convert into boosters!  Not having to buy yet another item two years down the road is a life-saver when you have to buy two of everything!!!",5,1
Playtex Spill-Proof Cup Replacement Valves 2 ea,I bought two of these so that I have spares when a valve is hiding in the dishwasher.  Fits perfectly into the cups and extends their lifespan.,5,1
"Baby Essentials Circle Fashion Diaper Tote, Sage","I love this bag but after only a couple days of use, the zipper is already giving out.  Planning on seeing if I can exchange it for a new one.  I really like it and hope it is just a defect on this one bag.Lots of pockets, perfect size to be a purse/diaper bag.",4,1
"South Shore Savannah Collection 4-Drawer Chest, White",I am so happy with my purchase! This dresser is beautiful and the color is perfect. It is sturdy and holds alot!! I would definately reccomend this (the whole southshore savannah collection),5,1
Mamas &amp; Papas Baby Snug and Tray - Raspberry,"This seat turned out perfect for my 5.5 month old...she has bigger thighs, so Bumbo seat would not have worked...also the seat grows with the child, you can pull the raspberry insert out. I have to admit the tray is not great, another reviewer complained about this...mine is not very secure either....but she hates the tray so it wasn't a problem for me. She is very secure in the seat, which is a relief (she can't tip out or over, however she is around 19 pounds, which makes a difference)...I don't walk away from her in it...it's just nice to know its sturdy and designed well. I like the seat because she is still a supported sitter and it supports her nicely, we can play and read from the seat, I usually lay her on the blanket or carry her and do this, so it is a nice change!",5,1
"Kids Line Luxury Security Blanket, Sage","We got an older one which was a bit smaller but this is the perfect lovey. It is super soft and a nice color. My daughter loves it. She plays with it, sleeps with it, talks to it. It is her comfort and we love it.",5,1
All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them Walt Disney wall art wall sayings,"I am a HUGE Disney fan. This quote was perfect for my childrens' playroom. I had a 1/2 of a wall of bare space next to a window, and didn't know what I wanted to put there. I have many different quotes all around the house so I have become a pro to these! I found this one on Amazon for a great price, and decided this would be perfect. It was so easy to apply to the wall - step by step directions were included. I have had absolutely no problems with it. It is on there and not going anywhere. I know from past experience that these vynl letters are easy to pick off when you are re-painting so I am not worried about that at all. I would definitely recommend this quote :) I love it.",5,1
Pack N Play - Playpen Netting Fits Most Graco - Jeep - Kolcraft and More!,Good purchase.  Fit the playpen perfectly (sorry forgot what brand).  Does it's job of keeping the mosquitos off of the baby.,4,1
Zutano Elephants Velour Changing Pad Cover,"I love how soft this changing pad cover is. The design is gender neutral and very bright and colorful. It fits perfectly with the LA Baby 32&#34; 4 sided changing pad, and has slits for the safety straps to fit through. I use an inexpensive pad liner on top of it sometimes to extend its use between washings. I've used stain remover on it several times (gotta love those baby blowouts!!) and it doesn't affect the colors or softness.",5,1
"Britax Baby Carrier, Black","The Britax Baby Carrier is lightweight and comfortable.  We also have a Kelty carrier that is perfect for hiking, but its metal frame is too cumbersome for errands and shorter walks.  The Britax is a great go-anywhere carrier.",4,1
"Boon Catch Bowl with Spill Catcher,Lite Purp/Red",I have a 2 year old who can use a spoon if the bowl doesn't move and there is a &#34;slop over&#34; extension. This is perfect and easy to clean. Just what I wanted.,5,1
Britax B-Agile Stroller Child Tray,This is a nice little tray for my son's stroller. It fits perfectly and doesn't get in the way when we close it up to out it away or in the car. It's a nice little tray and a good buy if you have the B-Agile series stroller.,4,1
Britax B-Agile Stroller Adult Cup Holder,I was looking for a cup holder that will fit Maclaren for a while. After reading reviews this one seems to be the one. Amazon shipping was very fast. It fit Maclaren Techno XT very well. Perfect fit for wider cups. Might not be so great with cans. Overall I am happy with the purchase.,5,1
"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red","So here is the setup we had when we took this to Europe, Paris France to be exact (survived the cobblestones, YEAH!! biggest worry). Compact fold down made stowing the stroller manageable in the small European living quarters. Light enough that the mountains of stairways were not a huge problem on our vacation (with 2 adults carrying the stroller, bumping it up and down the stairs was a little hazardous). Our 9 month old was very comfortable in it, no problem falling asleep but to make her a little more comfortable, I &#34;popped&#34; the foot rest portion up by pushing underneath the material (it actually stays in place probably because her leg did not extend all the way down yet) to give her a more 'flat' surface to ly on. The zip pocket is big enough for her stroller blanket and a small toy or two. We splurged on the Rosk pouch carrier (another LOVE item) and kept the blanket nice and clean, Placed two of the king mighty stroller hooks(fits perfectly right at the base of the handle) to hold our diaper bag and shopping bags. The rain cover was a must for us, not just for the rain but it blocked a lot of the wind and coldness. We were able to fold up the stroller WITH the rain cover still attached to the canopy portion. Oh and the canopy, LOVE!! sturdy, big and the 'window' allowed me to catch her falling asleep a few times so I could quickly adjust the seating. The biggest bonus was we were actually able to bring this INTO (yes, INSIDE) some of the restaurants/cafes when she was napping. We had heard many stories about this being such a big NO NO over there. (we did try to choose bigger establishments that COULD accomodate us and crossed our fingers to see if they WOULD) We were NEVER refused the few times we had to do this with her napping in the stroller, they were so accomodating, nice and sympathetic!!Some cons/wish list for future improvements: Not sure if this is airline specific (air tahiti) but we gate checked the stroller only to have to pick it up at luggage because it was too 'bulky' according to airline. Not a big deal since I ergoed her but caused some confusion when we landed and was waiting for the stroller.  Wish the handle could optionally extend out a little and change angles for comfort. I'm 5'2&#34; but the long walks made me wish I could position my arm and hand differently after a while.. A little unstable when folded and standing, it has to be in a certain position or it will fall over. Not crazy about the handle touching the ground when folded to stand stroller up. This might just be my daughter's preference but having the seat more upright would be wonderful, I often catch her leaning forward instead of resting her head against the head rest to sit up straight. I keep wanting to bring along a small pillow to place behind her but keep forgetting and it'll be one more thing I have to travel with that would be nice not to need. Again all of this are not deal breakers but would be NICE to have :)",5,1
"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red","I bought the B-Agile on a whim because I saw a great sale and had been salivating over some of the higher-end strollers that were fairly compact.  So glad I went for it!  I love that it has a higher weight limit than a lot of other strollers that are similar -- I have a 2.5-year-old son who is quite big for his age and wanted something he wouldn't outgrow anytime soon.  So here is a breakdown of the pros and cons:Pros:-Easy, one-handed fold (there is a safety button that you have to push first before pulling the strap to fold, which is a great feature)-Steers and pushes like a dream!-Huge canopy for those rainy/sunny days.  Has a mesh peek-thru window that allows you to hear your child.  I noticed that my older stroller of another brand had a plastic one, and I couldn't understand anything my children wanted to say without pulling the canopy all the way back.-Brake that is easy to lock/unlock with your foot, but still secure when you need it to be.-Fabric is nice; doesn't seem too hot for our little passenger.-The bar that goes across between back wheels is curved upwards, so you never kick it.  That was always a problem with previous strollers.-Huge storage pocket with zipper, under handlebar.  Somewhat makes up for the lack of parent tray.Cons:-No parent tray or cup holders!  Seriously, there should be at least one built in somewhere, but this seems to be a way to get you to buy the additional parent tray that hooks onto the handle.-No child cup holders.  I realize you can purchase the additional tray, but my son was disappointed that it didn't even have a pocket to stow his toys or sippy cup.-Basket is a little difficult to get purse in and out, if child is seated in stroller.  Not a big deal, as I realize this is a more compact stroller, but thought I should mention it.No matter how you look at it, this is a great stroller and highly recommended.  I gave it 4 stars because, let's face it, it is not perfect.  But with an included parent cup holder (at least) and child cup holder, I would gladly give it 5 stars.",4,1
"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red","After spending months of research for the perfect stroller for our family, we can say that we couldn't be any happier with the Britax B-Agile stroller with the chaperone infant car seat. Our family is always on the go, with my son's sporting events that takes us all over the country to my oldest daughter and mom that loves to go shopping to nearby malls while traveling. What is best about the stroller is it goes on all terrain, it can take the rough bumps at the sporting events to those tight narrow spaces in crowded malls with no problems. The stroller is light weight and very easy to use without sacrificing comfort and gives the best protection for our newborn. The true testimony to this stroller is our baby sleeps very well while traveling which makes us all happy:).",5,1
"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red","I purchased this stroller for my Mom, who watches my 8 week daughter 4 days a week. I have the UPPABABY Vista, which I love, but wanted something in between a full size and umbrella stroller. The B-Agile is just that! It opens and folds with one hand, is incredibly lightweight but safe and easy for anybody to operate. The Kiwi color is exactly as pictured, very vibrant and stands out from the typical black and red Britax offers. We use the Peg Perego Primo Viaggio infant car seat and this is now compatible to use with the purchased adapter. We probably won't be needing it, since it is used primarily with Grammy, but it is a great option. I am a first time Mom and research EVERYTHING (probably way too much) related to baby before buying and knew this would be a safe bet since the Britax brand is such a big name in baby gear. This is also going to perfect for traveling!",5,1
#70 Preppy Pink argyle baby leg warmers by My Little Legs,"I ordered these little leg warmers in about six different patterns, and I'll probably get more.  They're absolutely perfect: they're big enough that they'll fit my daughter for a while, but they stay on her legs even now (she started wearing them at about six weeks old - they're big, but they stay on as long as she's wearing socks). They're toasty enough to substitute for pants, and you don't need to pull pants off to change diapers - just pull them down slightly to get them out of the way. And they're completely adorable. We always get many, many compliments on them when she shows them off.  They make a great gift, too.",5,1
Ball Gown Pink Twin Bed Set,"My 4 year old granddaughter picked this out. We are redoing her room with a princess theme and castle on the wall mural so we needed a solid print. This is perfect for any princess! It is made well and very, very pretty. Snagging may happen if we let her play on it before pulling it back or if her kitty gets on it with her. She was so excited when it came that she jumped for joy!",5,1
"Obersee Kid's All-in-One Pre-School Backpacks with Integrated Cooler, Rhinestone Angel Wings","A great all in one bag for pre schoolers. I got this bag for my 5 year old and it fits perfectly, also the shape of the bag is good for support when carrying books. Only problem is if you have something frozen in the cooler section it sometimes causes the other section to sweat.",4,1
"Obersee Kid's All-in-One Pre-School Backpacks with Integrated Cooler, Rhinestone Angel Wings",Great backpack.Lot's of storage space.FunctionalGreat material.Many colors to choose from.Perfect for pre-schoolers 18 months and up.Highly recommended!!,5,1
One Pack BPA Free Replacement Tubing for Medela Pump in Style and New Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump,"The product works great - fits the Pump-N-Style Advanced perfectly.  Maybe it's just my mommy brain, but somehow I read ""retail pack of 2"" to mean two sets of tubes.  Just in case anyone else also reads it wrong, please take note that this just means one set.  If you are in need of two sets of tubing, make sure to buy two packages.  Otherwise, these are great!",5,1
"JJ Cole Mode Diaper Tote Bag, Mixed Leaf",Wonderful diaper bag.  Perfect size to carry everything you need but not look like your hauling luggage around with you.  Fits well under stroller.  Many storage slots to keep things organized.,5,1
"C.R. Gibson Keepsake Memory Book of Baby's First Year, Pretty Petals","Loved this baby book! It covers all the milestones and has a family tree, also. Some baby book can be overbearing and tedious to write in, but this one is perfect!",5,1

"Disney My Friend Pooh Musical Mobile, Sage/Ivory","My baby girl loves this mobile! She will lay and watch for hours!  Wish the song was a little longer, but it matches the design of the room perfectly!",5,1
"Stork Craft Milan 2-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, White","We needed a crib for our daughter, but didnt want to spend many undreds of dollars doing so. This was perfect. For a little more than a hundred dollars, we received a farily high quality crib that will convert into a bed when we need that. It took a little while to assemble, but once done, we realized this was really very sturdy, and fit our needs perfectly. All you need after assembly is a mattress, which we of course bought at the same time. Our daughter has really taken to the crib, and sleeps quite soundly at night. The crib itself looks nice as well, which is an added bonus. We are completely satisfied. Anyway, not really sure what else to say about the crib, although i will answer any questions you might have to the best of my ability and experience.Enjoy!ed: More than two years later (April 2014), this thing still works great. We removed the front and it now functions as a normal bed for our toddler. Further proof of a great purchase.",5,1
"Kushies Zebra Blanket with Plush Toy, Orange","I was afraid this was going to be a cheaply made blanket, but it's not. I'm very picky and I love this blanket and it's perfect for our new son. Not so small but just the right size.",5,1
"NUK Replacementvalves Spill Proof Cup, 4/pack",So nice to be able to purchase replacements instead of buying new cups.  I looked for these at various stores and I could only find them on Amazon. They are exactly the same as ones that come with the cups so they fit perfectly.,5,1
"UPPAbaby Cruz Stroller, Denny","We bought this stroller after selling our beloved BOB rev. on craigslist. We used the BOB for 9 months for my son, but it just wasnt practical (I dont jog/run, it didnt have a big basket, and was very bulky to take into stores quickly. However I did love how it unfolded easily, but it was heavy to fold up and lift into my small trunk myself. Overall I didnt realize what I'd need in a stroller until AFTER I had my son. Live & learn!) We did love how easily the BOB would go over pretty much anything. Nevertheless we sold it and after extensive research on strollers we decided it was between the uppababy brand because of the large baskets OR the city mini GT because of its easy fold up design. After looking over both strollers I decided on the uppababy cruz because of a few main factors. It SITS UP! I cant tell you how much my son hates being reclined when he is just riding in the stroller and not napping. The BOB and the City Mini had a slight recline and he always tried sitting more upright. The uppababy sits up like your sitting in a chair. He loves it! It also reclines nearly flat. The foot rest can be positioned upwards so that its as if he is sitting on the floor, because he is so upright and his feet are out in front of him. Also the LARGE basket was a HUGE plus! I cant tell you how great evvvvverything fits in there. Its perfect and soooo easily accessable. The city mini gt did NOT have a big enough basket for me, and there for was not the right choice for me despite the very easy fold up. The true test for us was this past weekend when we took it to Maine on a camping trip. YES it is no BOB! However I thought it was just fine over the rough bumps of a campground. Bumpy ride? Yes. But nothing my 10 month old couldnt handle, and honestly It wasnt that bad. We took it to old orchard beach and as I suspected, it didnt roll over the sand like my good old BOB did. But it rolls really nicely on pavement and I just carried my son over to the beach, and I figure he will be 1 soon enough and walking so I wont need the stroller on the beach anyways. I also love the reversable seat, that comes in handy because my son is going through some sort of attachment to mommy thing so he likes being able to face me from time to time. I also love that the Cruz is a less expencive option to the Vista. The vista is much much heavier and a little bigger. And since we didnt need the extras that the Vista comes with, this was the better option for us. Also: I called Uppababy and asked about a belly bar and toddler board for the cruz and they told me that BOTH would be available. The belly bar will be out this summer, and the board is ""in producton""... huge plus! So for us this stroller was a hit, but as anything goes, you MUST research what YOU need in a stroller and figure out whats important to you. Some people dont care about a big basket and in that case id for sure go with the City mini gt.UPDATE::1/7/13We are in LOVE with this stroller still. It fits great in the trunk of my saturn ion, and how I fold it is, I take the seat off first (takes 1 second) and then fold the frame. I found it fits and folds better that way, plus some times my son likes to sit forward and sometimes backwards still so I just set up the frame and then throw the seat on top depending on which way i think he wants to sit. The basket is just my fave feature. I cant tell you how happy I have been with the uppababby! My son is 16 months old and loves sitting in his uppababy, well worth it still.",5,1
"UPPAbaby Cruz Stroller, Denny","Before my son was born I purchased the Britax B-Agile and B-Safe travel system. For the first 6 months it was perfect, but once I stopped using the car seat the stroller alone was lacking many features I wanted (rear facing, reclining, large basket). I started researching strollers, and quickly realized that what fit my criteria were mostly high-end strollers and I would need to spend upwards of $900! That was not in my budget, so I kept looking for the perfect stroller under $500. I went to Buy Buy Baby with my baby in tow and tried them all. My top picks were the Uppababy Cruz, Quinny Zapp, Bugaboo Bee, Icandy Apple, and Peg Perego Book. The Quinny was way too difficult to fold, the Bee was too low and I just didn't like the look, the Peg Perego was not as easy to maneuver. I loved the Icandy, but it was sooo heavy!We finally settled on this one, and I'm so happy we did! It's very easy to fold, easy to maneuver, compact, and the basket is huge! It reclines 5 ways! Most important my baby loves it, he is so much more comfortable in it than in the Britax.",5,1

Crayola Bathtime Pals Squirt and Float Toys Squeeze 'N Squirt! (5 Squirters),I am very pleased. This product is very cute. I thought maybe they would be a bit bigger but they will fit perfectly in the hands of a three year old.,5,1
Dr. Brown's Designed To Nourish Flexpods Storage Jars and Stackable Freezer Trays,"I absolutely LOVE these pods for storing my homemade baby food! I tried some of the harder plastic jars that came with the processing system I bought, but even though they said they were freezer safe, they all cracked the first time I put them in the freezer. Then, I tried some of the  flexible trays, but once I froze them, I would have to thaw the whole tray to get out two or three servings. Since the baby food is only fridge safe for 3-4 days, I'd end up wasting a lot of food that way. The Dr. Brown's pods are perfect! They flexible plastic doesn't crack in the freezer, and I can take out just the portions I need. They are easy to clean, and the stacking trays keep everything nice and organized! I was worried about the tops coming off when we put them in the baby bag for travel since they pop on and off, but we've taken food with us on several occassions now and have never had any spills or leaks. This is a great product! I won't use anything else!",5,1
"Ulubulu Silicone Bib, Hoot the Owl",I love this bib!! After going through a gazillion I finally stumbled upon these and purchased Hoot the Owl for a test drive. When I got the bib I was very skeptical because it seems rather tiny. My son is 12 months and starting to play with his food and I thought it would be a disaster. To my surprise and delight it catches everything! My son also pulls his velcro bibs right off but because of the more secure closure of this bib we do not have this problem. I also love how easy to clean it is. Perfect for moms on the go! I'm buying more.,5,1
"Bottle Cooler Bag and Ice Packs for Breastmilk Storage.

Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,This is a wonderful little monitor to have if you want to always keep an eye on your little one! We've had this since christmas and it's been very helpful to us. It saves me worry about my baby girl who is not sleeping right next to me. We always wished for an IP camera but this works perfectly and it doesn't hinder me from using my cell. The construction quality is not exactly great but it works and that's all I care!,5,1
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,I received this monitor as a shower gift and it worked ok but it didnt last long while unplugged so it was a pain then it stopped working. I called the company and spoke with Mae who was a great help she sent me a new one right away and this one works perfect no issues at all. I would highly recommend this product.,5,1
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,This baby monitor is perfect for the price. The only con is not having a two way audio system. Anyway it works and has a good range.,5,1
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,You can't ask for a better video camera with sound for the price.  Very good quality and not expensive at all compared to others I looked at.  I'm only having one kid so I really didn't want to invest a ton of $ into a camera to use only a short while!  Perfect option.,5,1
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,Using it now for 2 month and for me works great. Sometimes my baby fusses at night but isn't awake so it's nice to see what's going on before it run out of bed to check on her. Picture is perfect of me I see what I need to see at day or night. Can adjust the brightness and volume makes it easy to use on different day times. No problem with our wifi and the monitor. Just wish the battery of the monitor last longer just need to remember to plug it in when I got to bed after 4 hours I get warning signal that the battery goes out. Also makes noise when the connection is not up . Love it and would never go without camera,5,1
Dr. Brown's Designed To Nourish Snack-A-Pillar Dipping Cups,"I make my own baby food and these containers are a perfect size for picnics and other times we eat outside of the home, as well as traveling.  I also store a container in my diaper bag with puffs or small snacks, which is super handy.  I love the colors or the lids.  I have not stacked these containers as shown, but rather used them singularly.  The cost is a bit high, but the quality, so far has been excellent.",4,1
Dr. Brown's Designed To Nourish Snack-A-Pillar Dipping Cups,I have used these for home-made baby food.  I freeze the cubes and then place them in this container to combine different meals on the go.  It has never leaked and fits about 3-4 cubes of food. I love the rounded top which helps with frozen cubes as flat top containers usually don't allow for good closure of frozen cubes.  Dry baby food also does not spill out.  I have used containers in the past where the dry cereal leaks out and I usually had to put the container in a zip lock bag to contain the spillage.  Not so with these.  They are great and don't leak either liquids or tiny dry ingredients. They are great to keep things like freeze dried fruit or yogurt bites from absorbing moisture while on the go.I have also used it for my 5 years old daughter that just started kindergarten.  It's easy for her to open and the perfect size for some cut up fruit or veggies. They are also fun colored tops so she does not think they are too ""babyish"" for her.I think I may buy more.,5,1
"Dr. Brown's Designed To Nourish My Dot Storage Labels, 72-Count, Colors May Vary","I love these!  The are the perfect size, plenty of room to write date, child's name, and contents of container.  I use these daily to send food and milk to daycare with my toddler.  I also use these on food containers I freeze.  Highly recommend these over other ones found at the large baby stores.",5,1
"Dr. Brown's Designed To Nourish My Dot Storage Labels, 72-Count, Colors May Vary","These are perfect!  They're sticky and they stick to baby bottles, but they can be easily removed and the best part is they don't leave a sticky adhesive residue.My daycare requires I put my baby's name on all baby bottles, so for that I bought inchbug labels, personalized, but I use these because daycare also requires I note date/time/and ounces on all breastmilk bottles.  So these allow me to note that information and easily remove them at the end of the day when the bottles are empty.I was using painters tape for a while so I wouldn't have the sticky mess, but these are so much easier and neater.  They're the perfect solution.FYI, there are about 5 different colors in the package, so they won't all be blue, or whatever color shows on top of the package.  The colors vary.  Love these!",5,1
"NoJo Engine 27 Reversible High Chair Cover, Ivory/Blue","This cover fits our Harmony Graco high chair we purchased back in 2006 (model #3951ORC) for our first child.  Our 3rd child is now using it and the cover that came with it has been completely worn out.  We are also now expecting our 4th child, so I decided it would be worth it to replace that one.  So glad I ordered this! It's so comfortable for him, it's easy to clean, and the print is so cute.  It fits our high chair perfectly not only in the print design, but also the colors and the dimensions.  I think it's worth the $27 price I paid for it as well.  I thought about purchasing a custom made one from Etsy, but decided against it as the people there were charging almost twice as much.  I'm glad I went with this!",5,1
SnoozeShade for Infant Carriers - the breathable sleep and sun shade (UPF50+/max UV protection),"i am a third time mom and of course, i am buying the least amount of new things, since this may be our last child! when my pediatrician said i should get a shade for our infant seat to keep people from touching the baby and spreading germs to him, i found the snooze shade. it is perfect and i'm so glad i got it. i wish i had it for my other two kids as babies! it was so affordable, it took about 2 seconds to put on the seat (two pieces of velcro and you're done), it is very thin and breathable and you don't have to take off the whole thing to get to the baby. you can just pull up the front of it and hook that part over the seat's handle. the other measure of success is seen in two specific instances so far. two different people coming up to me: ""is there a baby in there?"" ""yes, he's sleeping!"" we talked kindly but it prevented them from touching him :)http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&ref_=oh_rev_o06_s00_i00&asin=B0054OBZSI#",5,1

"The First Years Take &amp; Toss Straw Cups, 10 Ounce, 4 Pack","I love these cups for outdoor picnics and play dates.  While they leak a little, it isn't bad and for the price they are perfect for short term use and then recycling.",5,1
"The First Years Take &amp; Toss Straw Cups, 10 Ounce, 4 Pack","Not only for my son, I use them to put small amount of juice for myself too, it does not spill and fit perfectly at my cup holder. My son loves them, because they are so colorful~",5,1
"Kanga Care Pail Liner, Crimson","First time cloth diapering and this works perfect in our pail with the lid never slides down, washes out great ( inside out) no bad smell couldnt be happier!",5,1
"Kanga Care Wet Bag, Crimson","Pay attention to the measurements!! I thought this thing was supposed to be at least 3x larger than it really is. I don't know why. When I look at the picture I just see a large wet bag. It's not large. It holds 4-6 cloth diapers easily, though. I actually use this in my diaper bag as my twins' wet bag. It works perfect. Contains smell very well, holds up very well to washing, etc.I have no complaints.Just make sure you realize... it's small! :)In a nutshell... I think this makes the PERFECT diaper bag/on the run wet bag!",4,1
Tommee Tippee Lil Sippee Sipper Cup 10 oz (6 Months) - 2 Pack (Red/Blue),"They are perfect for my son, who refuse to drink out of Nuk silicone sprout (it worked well for his older sister). I hated all the sippy cups that are not microwave safe, I had to heat milk up in other containers and pour it in. What a pain! My husband is also clueless and microwave them from time to time, it stress me out. Bottom line, these are awesome for being microwave safe and super easy to drink out of.",5,1
Carter's Safari Sky Hamper,"I was so tired of the folding hampers because the wood kept breaking and they were so flimsy..this hamper is perfect! Perfect size, very sturdy, and really cute!",5,1

"TYKE TOTER Front Mount Child Bicycle Seat (Age 2-5 yrs., Weight Limit 45 Lbs.)","I cannot say enough great things about this bike seat.  When my daughter was younger, we had one designed for smaller children that went on the front of my bike under the handlebarsiBert Safe-T-Seat Front Child Seat (Green,38-Pounds limit).  It was great but she quickly outgrew it.  While she has a bike of her own now with training wheels, we are still limited in where we can go because she is still not big enough to ride much farther than back and forth in front of the house.With Tyke Toter we can now take bike rides, visit the library, visit friends and many other activities.  I get my exercise, we talk, we listen to music, we stop at garage sales, and we spend some fantastic one on one time together because she sits so close to me.The Tyke Toter is really easy to install and easy for both of us to get used to using.  I do have to ride with my knees slightly bent outward but it doesn't affect my control of the bike and I really feel like Tyke Toter has given us freedom we never had before.  Rear mounted seats cause instability.  Trolleys leave the child way out behind you and far away from you.  Tyke Toter is the perfect solution.(note: I received a Tyke Toter free of charge to test and review on my blog, I added this review here because I really do love and believe in this product)",5,1

"ERGObaby Teething Pads, Cream","Perfect for the ERGO carrier.  You need this for babies who drool and spit up a lot.  I desperately needed these, and when I got them, I got exactly what I wanted.  I only wish they included them with the carrier purchase.",5,1
Ikea PATRULL Non-Slip Bath Mat - Green Crocodile,Fits in our tub perfectly and allows our 8month old son to crawl around in the tub without slipping during bath time.,5,1
*The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* - Mixed Colors - Certified Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace - w/The Art of CureTM Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN THE USA),I absolutely love this necklace.  It's so cute.  We already had another brand and wanted a second.  They work great.  My daughter really shows a difference in her pain tolerance when she is wearing one.  This one is my favorite.  It's the perfect length.  Thanks for a great product!,5,1
Carter's Set of 5 Washcloths - Green-One Size,"These washcloths are not only colorful & cute, they also look good & retain the original look even after several washes. They are absorbent. I use them primarily as a safety shield over my little boy while changing his diaper, in order to avoid the pee projectile. I know this is not the typical use for a washcloth,but this makes my diaper changes less incident-prone! They are just the perfect size & texture with good absorbency. They are also gentle enough to dab-dry baby's bottom after wiping.",5,1
"Kushies Deluxe Flannel Change Pad, Yellow with Brown Dots","What can I say?  This changing pad is really cute and has a soft comfortable surface for baby and the backside is waterproof.  Cleaning is easy too, just throw it in the washer.  It's perfect!!",5,1
"Kushies Deluxe Flannel Change Pad, Yellow with Brown Dots","This changing pad is really big, perfect to throw down on our cream couch without having to worry. It washes really well. I haven't had any problems with shrinkage but I dry all my baby items on low.",5,1
"My Brest Friend Twins Plus Deluxe Nursing Pillow, Chocolate","As a breastfeeding parent of preemie twins, time is a valuable commodity to me.  This product has been amazing for me, giving me the ability to breastfeed both boys at the same time.  The additional pocket up front was a genius idea and is a perfect ""3rd hand.""  One warning, because it is, by necessity, very wide, it has to sit on top of the armrests of my chair.  As I have a short torso, this means I have to sit on a pillow to raise myself to the correct height.  Taller women, and those whose chairs have lower or no armrests will obviously not have this problem.  I have not found it to be too big of an inconvenience, and would still buy this product again.  The nurses in the NICU were impressed, and have begun recommending it to other parents of multiples!",5,1
Safety 1st Soothing Mist Ultrasonic Humidifier,"I bought this humidifier for my grandson's bedroom, which is about 10' X 12'.  We have hot water heat, so we have to bring in our own humidity, and I have humidifiers all over the house.  This one is perfect for his room and if the humidistat is correct, it gets the room to the ""comfort zone"".  I also like that it is easy to clean and it fits under my bathroom faucet for easy filling (after I take the directional spout off the top).  It is quiet and doesn't take up a lot of space.  The price was good as well.  I have been using this humidifier for 2 months now and have had no problems.",4,1
Safety 1st Bottle Medicine Dispenser,I could not find any other product to dispense 1 tablespoon of liquid vitamins for my son. This is perfect and even though hes 5...he loves using this to take his vitamins - daddy even uses one too...its non-messy - I will be buying more :-),5,1
"J.L. Childress Bag 'N Bags Duffle Dispenser, Black","Another perfect thing for the diaper bag.  Found this to come in handy at restaurants, friends houses, even when we are out hiking...keeps a smelly diaper in check!",4,1
SoHo- Lavender Diaper bag with changing pad 6 pieces set,Love it for my daughter from since birth. Use the big one for daycare and the small one to run errands in the town. The only thing I don't like is that the outside pockets are to shallow for my totes umbrella and too tight and deep for my 5 ounce nuk bottles. Other than that its a perfect bag,5,1
Baby Bella Maya Infant Car Seat Cover Pink Leopard,Love this carseat cover! Fit perfectly on my graco snugride! And sooooo cute! I get so many compliments on it and it turns a ok carseat into a fab one! Must have for your little diva. Warm for winter too,5,1
Philips AVENT 3-in-1 Electric Steam Sterilizer,I bought this product after finding out that microwave sterilization of my daughters bottle nipples were not recommended and of my breastpump shield also. It work perfectly and cuts time in half compared to boiling water. It is very simple to use and does not occupy that much counter space.,5,1
Tiddliwinks Dragons &amp; Knights Full Quilt W/2 Shams,"Bought this for my 8 yr old room. The quilt is nice and heavy which I'm very pleased with.  Only complaint  one of the squares needed to be resewn. The threading came loose, but other than that it is perfect!",5,1
Thomas Micro Raschel Blanket Oversized - 62in x 90in,"Finding Thomas the Train bedding in queen is pretty much impossible. We instead purchased a navy comforter, blue sheets, Thomas pillow cases and throw pillows and topped the bed wit this throw. It's the perfect size to cover the queen bed on top of the comforter and adds that punch of Thomas theme that my son's room needed!!",5,1
"Sashas Rain and Wind Cover for Peg Perego Aria Twin, and Aria Twin 60/40 Twin Side by Side Stroller","I have been debating about buying this product for the past 9 months.  Finally is began to rain again this fall so I just did it.  I wish I would have made this purchase even sooner.  I have been so pleased with the quality and functionality.  When I'm not using it, I either pull it up and leave it on or fold it flat and stick it under in the basket.  It is very easy to put on and take off and fits perfectly.  I would make this purchase a hundred more times!  Best choice ever!!!!",5,1
"Carter's Jungle Jill Plush Doll, Giraffe","This is a cute giraffe! It's soft & my little cousin loves it. I wanted to keep it, but I'm an adult so I'd look pretty funny with it, but I couldn't get over how soft. Perfect for any little girl!",5,1
"Hooter Hiders Nursing Cover, Darjeeling","I am extremely modest....this thing saved my life. I decided to exclusively breastfeed and this is perfect to discretely bf in public. It fits around the neck (adjustable) to where you can keep and eye on baby. The material is thin, breathable, and covers a perfect amount. The design is great too. Both baby and I are comfortable using it. I even use it to drape and tie over the carseat to cover baby. Works fine in place of a car seat cover!",5,1
Baby Care Play Mat - Pingko Friends (Large),I bought this mat after seeing it at another mommy friends house. I had the alphabet foam letters but they were constantly coming apart. This has been perfect and is a great size for my small living room. The only small negative is that it had a slight smell and I had to clean it pretty good to take the smell away. I am assuming this is just from packaging or something. It's cute and soft and easy to clean!,5,1
Baby Care Play Mat - Pingko Friends (Large),We ordered this mat just after Christmas for our 7 month old son.  It is the perfect amount of cushioning for him as we are still working on balance while we sit and play :)Another great thing about this mat was the fact there was no chemical smell when we took it out of the box.  I felt comfortable letting my son play on it right away rather than letting it air out as we've had to do with other items.  We would highly recommend!,5,1
Baby Care Play Mat - Pingko Friends (Large),"This mat is perfect! It's soft, big and very colorful. My little one loves it!",5,1
Baby Care Play Mat - Pingko Friends (Large),"My 7 month old son sits without support but at times he falls while playing so I wanted a mat which is thick & has good cushioning. This mat is just perfect for that! Since its a one piece mat & not like those tile mats, I can be rest assured that my son won't try to take off the pieces. The other plus point is that it has pictures on both sides. Currently my son is loving the animal pictures side but as he grows older I can use the alphabets & numbers side.Compared to other play mats it is expensive but its totally worth the money spent!The only reason I have given 4 stars for it because at times my son gets too distracted by the pictures and doesn't try to crawl like he does on the bed.",4,1
"Baby Aspen &quot;Hug-alot-amus&quot; Hooded Hippo Robe, Lavender, 0-9 Months","So first things first, this is a very good quality product.We got this for our little nephew and the color really is perfect. It's really lavender.. a mild purple not aggressive at all, perfect for a baby and not too girly for little boys!The only little problem was that it is actually pretty big and a bit too big for a newborn. Our nephew started using it only when he was about 1month old and it still is big. But it really doesn't matter because at this age, they grow up so fast anyway, and like that he will be able to wear it a little longer!",5,1
Playtex Nurser 4oz with 5 Drop-Ins liners (colors may vary),Its the only one she will take!  It works perfectly when dad wants to feed her so mom can get some rest.  It works....nuff said,5,1

Perfect addition to our neutral nursery. Would definately buy again from the Homeworks etc. brand.",5,1
"Homeworks Etc Owl Single Wall Hook, Brown","I love these hooks!  They are perfect for my daughters nursery.  There isn't really a theme in the room, and these are eclectic enough to work with everything else in the room.  They are mounted on sturdy boards and were very easy to hang up. Love them!",5,1
Chewy Charms Chewable Tube Necklace by Chew Stixx,"This item will be perfect for my child who needs something to chew on during school.  However, the lanyard that comes with it won't work because the clasp is too big to lace through the hole on the chewy.  Not sure how I am going to make it work, but I am happy with the product otherwise...",4,1
CoCaLo Baby In the Woods Plush Owl,"This little plush owl is absolutely precious.  I gave it to my sis-in-law at her baby shower.  My niece has an owl-themed bedroom, complete with faux birch bark curtain rods.  This owl was the perfect addition to her room.  Love it!",5,1

"NUK Disney Winnie the Pooh 5 Ounces Learner Cup Silicone Spout, 6+ Months","This training cup is perfect for the price. My 7months old baby loves it so much that she cries whenever I want to take it away from her.with the cup turn upside down, water doesn't spill.this cup is 100% ok",5,1

"Serta Perfect Start Crib Mattress, White","I needed something firm for my aging girl, it's easier for her to get up and down if she's not mired down by fluff. Toss a down washable throw over it and it's perfect, nice thick and insulating from the cold floor, she LOVES it! Very lite and easy for me to move.  Big enough for me to plop down and cuddle with her. Already planning on getting a couple more for my other dogs! I paid 39 with a shipping fee of 13.99.I'm baffled by the constant flux of pricing on this product. I just bought two more for $26.57 each. Now it is 47 with 10.49 shipping. Yesterday it was 26.57, the day before 41 with 15.99 shipping. Wth! My next 2 were in individual HUGE cardboard boxes, both would have fit in one box. Someone got tape happy too. Glad they were entertained!",5,1
"Serta Perfect Start Crib Mattress, White",I have three kids so I've been through a lot of these crib/toddler bed mattresses.  I got this one for my daughters new toddler sleigh bed.  It fits perfect. It's pretty bouncy and comfortable. I've had expensive toddler matresses and this one is just as thick and good quality as them.  Def. buy this if you're looking for a new crib or toddler mattress.,5,1
"Athena Leila 2 Piece Nursery Set, White","Pros:Great priceThe crib is standard size 52*28&#34; which is big enough to suit a 4 yrs. kidIt is almost 3 in 1 room as the table acts as a dresser & changing table!The dresser is very spacious that can hold all your babies' stuffCons-It took a long time to assemble however the catalogue is very explicit! But it comes in many parts!-The drawers don't fit perfectly in there as they don't slide smoothly.. You feel like it needs to be lifted in the middle to give the drawers smooth sliding!-Finally the paint has some flows in some places, but this is because I'm a very picky person!However for the multi purposes, spacious drawers & boxes & the great price the cons weren't an issue at all & I would totally recommend it!",4,1
"BFlowerYan Door Stop Finger Pinch Guard , Mixed Color [4pc-pack] (4xanimal)","These are darling and work perfectly! I took away one star as I was expecting a mixed color/animal pack and I received 3 blue otters and 1 yellow tiger. I don't mind, but I think it should be stated that you may not receive all the items as pictured.",4,1
"BFlowerYan Door Stop Finger Pinch Guard , Mixed Color [4pc-pack] (4xanimal)",These door stops are perfect. No pinched baby fingers and no more doors slamming on windy days. It is a great value.,5,1
Summer Infant By Your Side Sleeper Portable Bedding,"We love this bassinet! It's the perfect size for our Nora. Easy to set up and light-weight and therefore perfect for traveling on setting on our bedside dresser. A friend had given us a cheaper travel bassinet, but what I loved about this one is how sturdy it is, I never was worried about it breaking or collapsing on her. It has these wonderful mesh sides to help prevent SIDS which is great because I know my Nora would always flip onto her side and bury her face into the mesh, so a solid side bumper might have suffocated her. She loves how comfortable the bed is as well.For the price I don't think we could have found a better bassinet, definitely recommending to my future mommy friends.",5,1
juDanzy purple and black witch stripe baby leg warmers for girls or toddlers,"I was looking for something to cover my very skinny 7yo daughter's legs with her Halloween costume and these are perfect! They appear well made and after Halloween is over, they will be turned over to my 19mo for day to day wear. They will be great for keeping her extra warm on the way to Grandma's in the mornings!",5,1
juDanzy Bumble Bee Leg Warmers for Baby Toddler and Child,"These leg warmers are perfect for a bee costume! We used them as arm warmers on my daughter's costume. They are a lighter weight,  so not ideal for outdoor Autumn activities in colder areas (like mine) but still, very nice quality.  The colors are bright, but not neon. Perfect accessory for my little Sweet Bee!",4,1
Summer Infant Extra Camera For Baby Touch 02000,Perfect camera to keep an extra eye on those kids.... I bought this set after looking at several cameras! I love that I can have 4 cameras going at once in my house! It works great for watching the kids while they sleep and play! I like that I can see who is causing the fights since everyone blames the other sibling! Busted!!!!!!,5,1
Graco Pack N Play With Bassinet - Kensley Fashion - Includes a Bonus Sheet!,"We've been using the bassinet portion of this pack n play in our living room for our son's naptime for about 2 months now. We're very happy with the product & our son sleeps well in it. I like the fact that the bassinet is the full size of the pack n play, only raised up for easy access to baby. It's great to use as a portable crib when we're on the road, too. It did not come with a bonus sheet, however, like it advertised. I used a standard pack n play sheet which fits it perfectly.",4,1

"Trend Lab Fleece CribWrap Rail Covers for Crib Sides (Set of 2), Brown, Narrow","My son chewed deep gouges in his crib rails one night before we realized it. We had a makeshift solution of a towel duct taped to the crib rail for a long time. It did the job but was really ugly. I was finally tired of looking at it and ordered these rail covers. They're perfect! Really nice looking, practically unobtrusive. We have a Graco Lauren crib, and these fit the side rails perfectly. My son doesn't chew as much now, so I don't know if they would really prevent more chewing (he has put his mouth on it though), but it does nicely hide the ugly chewmarks. I was thinking we'd have to buy a new toddler bed, but it looks nice enough now that we'll just convert the crib into a toddler bed.",5,1
"Trend Lab CribWrap Fleece Rail Cover for Long Rail, Brown, Narrow",I love this! It's so soft and fits along the front bar of her crib perfectly. Now I don't have to worry about my LO hurting herself on the bar now that she's standing or trying to teeth on the wood. It's really easy to attach as well. Excellent product!,5,1
"Trend Lab CribWrap Fleece Rail Cover for Long Rail, Natural, Narrow","The crib I have at my home for my grandson has a very narrow side rail and so this fits perfectly.  Have only washed it once twice, but I think it will hold up nicely.",5,1
"Trend Lab CribWrap Fleece Rail Cover for Long Rail, Natural, Narrow","It looks nice on our crib, much nicer than I would have pictured we have a Medium Maple colored crib its darker and warmer than the natural color in the picture and it has sleigh short ends. Anyway I bought the natural Cribwrap cover and I am very glad Amazon had a narrow one available  because its perfect. My DS watched me tie it one in 2 minutes after a quick wipe with a damp cloth and he immediately stuck his chompers in.. Unfortunately I hadn't had the foresight to purchase this before he had teeth and the crib has some damage but NO MORE NOW !! Oh did i mention It protects your child from the chemicals in the wood yuck eating stains -no thanks. I recommend this highly if you can wrap your hand around the rail you should get the narrow and if you cant well I would measure first and get the fatter version if not because you should save those teeth and that wood.. Baby first after all . oh and its super soft.",5,1
"Animal Planet Neck Support, Lion","I know you designed these wonderful neck pillows for children; however, they are really great for adults with neck problems.  The adult traveling pillows are to large to properly align the neck between the normal pillow used at night.  These little cuties are just perfect.  And... hey, grownups can really benefit from using them.  There are perfect.",5,1
Infantino Sash Mei Tai Carrier Black/Gray,"I'm VERY surprised by this mei tai! My son is a month old and 10 1/2 lbs and it works awesome. I've had the k'tan and a sling and didn't like either. I LOVE this carrier. I wanted a babyhawk but couldn't afford it at the moment so got this based on all the great reviews, still nervous about it. I'm so glad I did. I feel secure enough to be hands free (don't with the k'tan as much). Baby loves it, he fell asleep within 5 minutes of being it it. He hates being put down so this will be a lifesaver. I'm not sure how this will be with an older child, it's a great concept so we'll see, but I may want something more supportive on my end (it's fine for them I feel). This is well worth the money and I highly recommend it. If you're baby hates being face in, this may not be for you. My son only wants to be face in, he hates if I cradle hold him of hold him on my side, so this is wonderful. If you are unsure about a mei tai, this is the perfect buy. It's convinced me to love them. It's super cute too! Babies r us has the other design. Enjoy!!!",4,1
Infantino Sash Mei Tai Carrier Black/Gray,"I have four different carriers and this is my second favorite. The Infantino Tie Wrap is quite comfortable and it allows the baby to face forward or towards you and can be worn on your back, but it doesn't have the head support like the Ergo Baby and also takes a little more effort to put on and to put baby into it. My other carriers are the Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Slate, the Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining and theBABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton. The Moby is very comfortable and excellent for the first 2 months of birth since baby can snuggle right in there with you and you can get skin to skin contact. BUT the Moby wrap has so much fabric and takes a while to put on and take off. The Baby Bjorn is the easiest to get baby in and out, but it is the least comfortable on my shoulders. I can barely last 30 minutes with a 15 pounder. The Ergo carrier provides the most comfortable hold for the parent which enables me to carry around my little one longer than the other carriers. It's easy to put on and take off and equally easy for my little one to get in and out. I love that there's a head cover for shade and sleeping babies. You can use this carrier on your back too. the Ergo is also a favorite for dad.If you want a more comprehensive review on baby carriers, visit the website AllMomsArePerfect.com. Look under baby gear essentials and you'll find a guide on strollers, cribs, diaper disposals, and baby carriers. It's also got information on what to expect at the hospital for delivery, the recovery process, and how to get sleep the first few months (sleep deprivation sucks).",4,1
Infantino Lil' Fluff Cart &amp; Highchair Cover Blue/White,This shopping cart/high chair cover is FABULOUS! I bought it for my son and it fits over most all carts and high chairs.  The only cart it hasn't fit over is the double wide carts at BJ's Wholesale! I have washed it several times and it hasn't faded or compromised the durability of the fabric! Perfect as a gender neutral option or boy""ish"" pattern!,5,1
"Winnie the Pooh Toddler Bedding 4 Piece Set, Yummy Hunny Pink","This bedding set is so soft, and my daughter loves it!  It fits perfectly!  The only thing I would change would be to have a smaller pillowcase.  If you use a standard pillow in a toddler bed it tends to take up alot of space.  Otherwise - it really is a great set.  I would buy this again.",5,1
"Disney 4 Piece Minnie's Fluttery Friends Toddler Bedding Set, Lavender",My daughter has been using this about 9 months now. Still looks brand new! Very bright colors. Very nice fabric material and feel. Not too hot. Just perfect. I do recommend this product. I am satisfied with my purchase. 5 stars!,5,1
Safety 1st Complete Air 65 SE Protect Convertible Car Seat,"We had one similar for our other daughter and ordered this for the newest monkey in our jungle and it works perfectly. Easy to install and the kid~monkey loves it too. It is bigger than some, but I appreciate the extra protection over it being smaller. Both seats sit side by side in the back seat of my F-150 truck perfectly.",5,1
"Britax Car Seat Travel Cart, Black",This did help a lot through the airports but was also a pain because no matter how tight or perfect I had my sons seat on the travel cart it would still fall over... Other than that perfect invention I got tons of complements on how awesome it is.,4,1
4moms Mamaroo Plush Green Jacks,"It arrived sooner than expected and was in perfect condition!  It wasn't hard to put together, and it works like a charm :)",5,1
RAW Natural Unrefined King Size Cones Rolling Papers 3 Pack,Got them in two days they are king size and they smoke perfect. I already smoked one and they burn nice. No runs.,5,1
"The First Years Car Seat Cover, Gray",This is the perfect weight.  Any heavier makes baby sweat.  It fits well over our BabyTrend carseat.  The zipper is much more practical than on other products we have used.,5,1
Superman &amp; Shield Comic Little Boy Blue Soft Baby Blanket for Boy TM &amp; DC Comics,Purchased this blanket for a baby shower gift. It's adorable and is a favorite blanket.  Super soft.  Perfect size for tummy time and to cover infant in carseat.,5,1
"BooginHead PaciGrip, Black Flourish","I like the print is actually IN the material. Once you see it, you'll know what I mean. It wasn't just printed on or something cheap, the quality is amazing for the price,,I only use Sootie pacifiers and a lot of people have a hard time figuring out how to use them with this type of holder. It is quite easy though, I just got a pair of scissors and twisted a hole in the tab, close to the bottom as possible so to avoid the tab breaking. Then just lace the string through the hole.:). Very cute, perfect even for Soothies! I get so many compliments on it. I have a Ju Ju Be diaper bag in almost the same print and ordered a Seven Sling that also has the same print....looks like I bought them together!",5,1
DIE-CUT 3 PANEL ADJUSTABLE WOOD PAW PRINT DESIGN PET GATE - BLACK,"The gate is exactly what I needed to keep my small dog out of my carpeted dining room.  Though she knows better, sometimes she can't resist an indiscretion in there, and this gate is perfect for preventing such an occurrence.  It's low enough that most people can step over, so might not work for a very large, athletic or determined dog, but for my polite little girl, the gate says &#34;no&#34; and she obeys.  It's strong and well made, but also light enough that I can just move it aside when I need to enter that room.  It's in three hinged sections, and of course does not stand up when extended straight out.  Making a shallow bend at each joint, however, keeps it standing very well.  It's black, nicely finished, and looks classy.  I was afraid it would be clunky and tacky, but it's quite pretty, unobtrusive, and doesn't detract at all.",5,1
"Supergate Deluxe D&eacute;cor Metal Gate, Espresso","Gate arrived in good condition, easy to set up and fit perfect in our opening.  We are using it outside and so far no weather effects but we have only had it about 2 mos.  It looks nice and is perfect for our dog (King Charles Cavalier) Bars are close enough that he can't fit through, tall enough he can't jump over.  We can step over it though and/or use the swinging gate door for entry and exit.  Would purchase again.",5,1
"Supergate Deluxe D&eacute;cor Metal Gate, Espresso","I needed a gate to fit the doorway of my basement laundry room which is 66"" wide.  I needed something that would keep two basset hounds out of the room at will, but allow me to let them in when needed (they take their bath in the laundry room).  This gate works perfectly.  It is true that the gate bends to accommodate shorter widths but that was not a problem for me as it is a basement hallway that is not used much and it does not bow out a lot in our application.  Installing it was so easy.  I didn't even need the instructions ( this may not be the case for some people). It came with a template, but honestly, I just put the attachments on the ends, marked them, and then secured them to the wall.  Easy peasy. Not bad for a girl!  ;-)Looks nice and functions great! Thanks Amazon!",5,1
"Supergate Deluxe D&eacute;cor Metal Gate, Espresso","Gate is perfect. Can conform to really wide area or just the width of the opening. Very secure in its mounting. Secure gate latch. Not easy for even our five year old to open, which is good/bad but at least the younger ones can't get it open. We use it at the top of a wide staircase....works wonderful and allows a little room at top so you don't have to still be on stairs and open gate at same time.",5,1
Disney Pooh Spring Friends 4-Piece Crib Bedding Set,We bought this cute nursery set for our little girl's nursery and its perfect!!!! its exactly what we were looking for!,5,1
"Luvable Friends Fitted Portable Crib Sheet, White",The quality and fit was perfect for my Davini Crest 50 Coil Mattress. I purchased another sheet from American Baby Company and they were too short to cover the depth of this mattress. I will be ordering 1-2 more of these sheets. Too bad they don't have too many colors to choose from.,4,1
Summer Infant Fold 'n Store Tub Time Bath Sling,"I got this when he was 2 months old. Mind you he is a very big boy, at that time weighing in at 15lb1oz n 25.5in long. It is perfect for what I needed it for. Would defently recomend this product to any one needing a sling to support baby while bathing them.",5,1
"Thanksgiving Bib - Embroidered, Happy Thanksgiving",These holiday bibs are nice and thick...perfect for teething babies like my twins. They will look nice over holiday outfits and not ruin pictures.,5,1
Display Box - 30 singles,Bought these for my partner in Afghanistan.  He said they were a god-send: perfect for the regular trips he took when showers were just not available.  Very nice company too: they sent a really nice note to him as a US soldier.,5,1
Shopping Cart &amp; High Chair Cover,this cover is well worth the price.  It is perfect to have for a shopping cart or high chair. I would recomend it.,5,1
Buggy Wuggy 1st Year,Perfect for the months pictures! The colors in the stickers are vibrant and easy to see in the photos.  I would recommend this product.  Shipping was fast and came in the expected time frame.,5,1
"BABYBJORN Travel Crib Light 2, Black",I love this travel crib! I use it when I go out of town ... It's super lightweight and fits in the overhead bin on a plane. Super easy to put up and take down!! I use the American Baby organic pack n play sheets ... They fit perfectly and are only $9.99. They are also really soft and hold up well.,5,1
Gobble n Go Stainless Steel Kid's Snack Cup with Slotted Silcone Top and Handle,"This is the only Stainless snack cup that I could find. Since I am trying to use only items that are not plastic, I searched for snack cups made from stainless. This cup is perfect and it is not too heavy for a toddler to carry. The handles make it easy to carry.",5,1
BRICA Infant Comfort Canopy Car Seat Cover,"It's fits my graco perfectly, we live in Texas so the hot sun is an issue! This cover has given him more than enough shade. I don't even take it off in the restaurants, I just unzip it where I can easily reach in and plenty of air can go thru. The side and top still cover him completely, but I can have easy access. The sun shade is cool too, it is permantly attached to a pocket on the top of the brica so when u want it u just unzip and pull down. It secures quickly with snaps on the sides and bottom. I couldn't have been happier, I ordered this one and another model that was from another company to see which I liked better. When this one came my husband said return the other one, I really like this one. It comes off and goes on without hassel, it even folds up into a small case that fits in my diaper bag.",5,1
BRICA Infant Comfort Canopy Car Seat Cover,"I purchased this for my daughter's 3 month old and she raves about it.  Went to visit friends with two infants and they all wanted one... Perfect for Beach, pool or just a stroll... good sun or bugs protection.",5,1
"JJ Cole Diapers and Wipes Pod, Mixed Leaf",I use this for diapers and wipes when we go to the pool or beach. Fits a few diapers and a wipe container. Material is perfect. Anything that gets on it will wipe right off.,5,1
"Cocalo Lamp Base and Shade, A to Z Boy","I ordered this base to pair up with the matching lampshade I ordered from here because I didn't like the shade pictured.  The lamp shade I got is an airplane theme as well and the browns from the lamp base and shade match perfectly.  It is absolutely adorable. When I got it in, there was no damage and the lamp shade is actually cuter in person.  Its darker so I'm using it with another base in another room because I like the airplane shade better with it.  I came out spending more money like that, but hey, its my first born.",5,1
Kiinde Kozii,"We bought two of these, one for the nursery and one for the kitchen. It fits our Dr. Browns wide bottles perfectly. It isn't too loud. Seems to warm the bottles in a reasonable amount of time. I'm not sure what the people who are complaining about the time expect from a water-warmer. It isn't a microwave!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Diaper Bag, Brown","I absolutely love this bag!! Before this I was just using knapsacks and stuff... This thing is awesome!! It has two side pockets that bottles fit PERFECTLY into, and lots of little pockets on the inside for diapers and everything else you need. The little changing pad it comes with is nice too. Durable and cute!!",5,1
"Swaddlebees Simplex 2.0 All in One Cloth Diaper (Medium, Cow)","These things are the best. I love them. I would have more of them if they weren't so darn expensive. They hold everything amazing, Some people complain that they aren't very soft on the inside, but the soft makes my kid sweat and gives her diaper rash, so these are perfect for us. I can't say enough good things about these diapers. They are so much better than BumGenius (my 2nd favorite) I'm surprised they aren't more popular or known like the BGs.The other added bonus with these is that they are Made in the USA! :)",5,1
SoYoung Charlie Unisex Diaper Bag (slate/charcoal),"I LOVE this bag! It has many more pockets and storage areas than the picture shows. The front flap (as seen in the product picture) has a magnetic closure and is perfect for my phone and keys. There is also another storage pocket between this front one and the bag. There is a zipper section that can hold your personal things (with a magnetic pocket for your sunglasses - and I have BIG sunglasses that fit - a zipper pocket for lip gloss, etc., a bigger area for your wallet and plenty for those other &#34;items&#34; that seem to find their way into a woman's bag). There is the actual baby storage area that is easily organized AND there is a hard interior flap that folds down to the bottom and holds the bag's shape; I have a pocket for diapers, the changing pad rolls up and fits nicely in the corner, my wipes container fits nicely and there is room for extra outfits. There are two mesh pockets (fits baby's sunglasses, pacifiers, etc.) and two clear plastic pockets. There is a big zipper pocket that is advertised to hold a laptop (fits my MacBook Pro very well) and there is a pass-through pocket on the very back that can hold a blanket and whatnot. The shoulder straps work well and the cross-body messenger strap works if you like that style. I have not tried it as a backpack yet, but I do like the stroller straps.I had a Diaper Dude bag previously (I wanted something &#34;manly&#34; for my hubby and my baby boy) and while it is perfectly acceptable and holds what is needed, I am so happy with this SoYoung Charlie bag. I LOVE IT!!",5,1
"Child Craft Shoal Creek Ready-to-Assemble Storage Chest, Jamocha","This was the perfect addition to our nursery.  It was very easy to assemble and it looks and feels higher quality than what it actually is!  Even though it is particle board with laminate, it is very stable.  All of the pieces were cut evenly, so there is no &#34;rocking&#34; (like what can happy with some furniture that you have to assemble at home...)  I especially like the child safety hinge.  It has a hinge that's not really a &#34;slow close,&#34; but it requires you to push the lid down the whole way so it will never slam down.  The slots in the top are good so that little fingers do not get slammed either :-)",5,1
"Athena Nadia 3 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","It looks beautiful. The price is very fair for this product. The only thing that bothered me was, one screw that didn't line up perfectly. And when I received it, the box was damaged. I thought that the crib was going to be damaged, but luckily it wasn't.",5,1
Carter's Jungle Jill 30&quot; X 40&quot; Rug,It was the perfect finishing to my granddaughters nursery. It made the room come together. I wished it was slightly larger.,5,1
S1 by Safety 1st AeroLite Premier Travel System Stroller - Key West,"First time mom -- love this system. The infant seat is a bit heavy but I manage (5'3&#34; and 110 lbs so I'm doing okay) the stroller is a great size, we went to Disney when my son was five weeks old and with four suitcases, a bunch of food, and other random stuff, the stroller fit perfectly! And that was from Michigan!! The stroller held everything we needed it to and more. And I love that it's so easy to open. I also love the color/design of the system, I even bought the matching high chair and pack n play. :)",4,1
Child to Cherish Marshmallow Clay Handprint Ornament,"Turned out okay. No mess, no fuss. The rolling pin is kindof a joke and the cut outs don't make a perfect circle, but overall it was easy and the kids had fun with it. Nice keepsake!",4,1
"Pickles Embroidered Fleece Baby Blanket with Satin Trim, University of West Virginia","West Virginia University blanket, it doesn't get much better than that. The blanket is perfect for our little one on the way.",5,1
"Pickles Mon Ami Doudou Baby Blanket, Harrison Horse","My son loves his Harrison Horse more than any other toy!  It's machine washable and extra cuddly.  A doudou is a comforting soft object, often a baby blanket or stuffed animal, and usually small.  This one is perfect for traveling and sleeping as an infant.",5,1
Rosallini Baby Nose Cleaning White Clear Plastic Tweezers w Cap,Perfect for taking out those nasties.  It won't hurt child and it makes it easy especially when they can't blow their noses. I usually use a little saline solution before to loosen up any hard or dry bits but then it's just simple to pluck those buggers out.,5,1
"Safety 1st Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat, Seaside Bay",Have this same car seat for my Dad's car for my son and was in search for an extra car seat to put in my Fiance's car...Didn't need anything too expensive since my son isn't in my fiance's car every single day so the price of this was perfect to spend on an extra seat.,4,1
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Select-a-Show Soother,"This thing is so stinkin cute! I got it for my nephews 1st birthday and what a hit! My 9 month old loves it as well! I will probably buy another! It got here a week early and was perfect! This is a must have, its cute and the sounds/music arent loud and annoying every parents dream!",5,1
Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Portable Potty,I bought this mostly for the portable ring and carrying case. That part is perfect for using on the go in public bathrooms. When you are not using it it folds nicely into the carrying case and into the diaper bad/back-pack that we use. I wish it was sold separately.,5,1
Squeak E. Mouse Learn to Dress Doll,"Perfect for an 18 month old.  Buckle and buttonhole  a little small and tricky.  Wish there had been velcro on the other pocket flap.  Very, very cute!  I bought it because of the reviews and the fact it is almost 18&#34; tall.  Nice and big for little hands.",5,1
"Gerber 5 Pack Prefold Birdseye Organic Diaper, White","I bought these to use as burp cloths and I have been very pleased. They are inexpensive and very absorbent, which is a perfect combination for a burp cloth!",5,1
"Angel Dear Robot Blankie Security Blanket, Fuchsia",The perfect security blanket for any infant.  It is soft and small enough to feel safe leaving in the crib.  My son loves his Robot blankie and sleeps with it always.,5,1
"Bumkins Waterproof Zippered Wet Bag, Blue Cat","We love this little bag. It fits nicely in a small pocket in our diaper bag, holds 2-3 dirty (3 is kinda pushing it but it can be done) cloth diapers, snaps to the diaper bag or stroller while we're still out and washes perfectly with the diapers once we get home. I really like that the outside isn't a cloth material so it won't fade in the wash.",5,1
"Bumkins Waterproof Zippered Wet Bag, Blue Cat","This bag does just what it says it does!  It keep clothes dry inside or keeps the wet clothes from wetting anything else around it!  I use this bag in my son's diaper bag and it's great to use for soiled clothes, burp cloths, bibs, etc.  Instead of getting everything else in my bag all nasty, this small sack is the perfect go-to!  And I love that it can just be thrown in the washing machine!  And it comes out looking just as great!  I'm not crazy about the pattern of the material, but I can live with it :)",5,1
Bright Starts Having a Ball Get Rollin Activity Table,This toy is amazing for babies/toddlers.  We've had it for probably six months now and my 10 month old is still entertained by it.  My son spends tongs of time playing with all the different areas and gets a kick out of the balls.  He loves to throw them down the hold and practices picking them up.The bilingual feature is perfect and clear.My only complain is that I wish it were a more sturdy.  My son tries to pull himself up and I worry that he's going to end up pulling it onto himself and get hurt.  He also leans on it since he can't stand by himself yet and the table moves very easily.,4,1
Bright Starts Having a Ball Get Rollin Activity Table,"My 9 month old has had this table for 2 months so far.. and I'm embarrassed to say that she plays with it for hours a day, though not all at one sitting.  I researched the Fisher Price and V-Tech version of similar tables (and watched my daughter play with them at friends' houses) - this one is so much better!  It seems like there are more activities than the others.  We started without the legs, added them a month ago.  She loves it both ways, and we'll probably take the legs off again soon just to change things up.As another reviewer mentioned, the functionality switches between ""play"" and ""learn"" mode by flipping the page of the book.  There are so many melodies (English and Spanish too) that even after hearing it daily, my husband and I still think we're hearing new songs.  We don't find them annoying at all.  Actually, to correct the other reviewer, the ""red triangle"", ""blue circle"", etc audio corresponds to the buttons of the caterpillar that are the corresponding color and have that shape on them.  It's pretty obvious if you sit down and play with your child.The alligator mouth covers a compartment that is great for hiding the balls or puffs/Cheerios.  My little girl loves to find things there.  She even knows the sound associated with the alligator door and comes crawling to look for food if she hears it.  One of the smartest things that Bright Starts did was to make the 1,2,3 buttons so that they click and pop out.  It's hard to describe, but it's different than just pushing a button - the child gets feedback and it's easier to operate.  Initially, my baby couldn't figure out how to push buttons on any of her toys.  These were easier for her to manipulate and seemed to help her figure out the ""cause and effect"" of the other buttons.Of course, the ball slide is a huge part that sets this table apart from the others.  We have so much fun watching her try to stop the balls from falling into the hole and then chasing them around after the come out of the leg.  The balls are the perfect size for little hands, too.  It comes with six - 2 each of red, yellow and blue.The toy will automatically play a random tune about 30 seconds after the last button/activity was activated.  At first we thought it was broken.  We were wrong - it's actually genius.  I cannot count how many times my kid has gotten fussy or wandered away from the toy and been drawn back by that reminder song.  Just so you know, it's on purpose!  We honestly thought it was haunted the first few nights when it would play songs after we had cleaned up even though no one was playing with it.At 9 months, she has not yet mastered the yellow spinner or the gear-like activity.  She also doesn't reliably let the balls go down the slide on purpose.  Due to this, I foresee her playing with this for at least another year if not longer.  It's really been a lifesaver since she became mobile and hated being constrained by her jumper.  I will say that I got this around the holidays for around twenty-four bucks.  I think the Amazon price is a little high because, according to the packaging, this model is made just for Toys R Us.  You should be able to find it for significantly less there.",5,1
"DK Leigh Crib Nursery Bedding Set, Distinctive Cupcake Baby, 10 Piece",When we found out we were having a girl I couldn't agree with over the top pink!  This was the perfect compromise of girly without being overwhelming.  The set looks better in person than it did in the pictures and the few loose threads we found were easily clipped or pulled out without damaging the integrity of the seams or stitches.  The additional colors in the polka-dots also allowed you to work other colors into the room too. Great quality and a GREAT price!,5,1
"Taggies SeeMe Rattle, Pink","My 7 month old daughter absolutely ADORES this toy! The tags are perfect for teething/sucking on, while the rattle is entertaining & the mirror is fun, too! It's soft & bigger than I expected, but perfect for her little hands & mouth. I love this brand & this particular rattle toy! Must buy!",5,1

"Foundations Elite Play Yard, Cilantro","This play yard is perfect for when I care for my little 6-month old great granddaughter.  I searched and searched for a safe and attractive play yard.  In reading reviews by users of other play yards, each had some point that caused me concern (safety).  I am so happy that I found the Foundations play yard, it is safe, pleasing to the eye and was affordable.",5,1
"Gunamuna Gunapod Wearable Baby Sleepsack Cocoon Blanket, Large","We received the pink Gunapod as a present when we had our second child, a little girl.  I don't know how we made it without one for our first!  Our little girl stays in her Gunapod almost all the time.  It is perfect for newborns who like to be swaddled but still have control of their arms - all the way to babies who roll around in their crib because it keeps them from getting tangled up in a blanket.The Gunapod is incredibly soft and durable.  We have probably washed it 15 times and it still looks brand new!  I have purchased more for friends and it has become my staple baby shower gift.  Can't say enough about how perfect this has been for us!",5,1
CoCaLo Dahlia - Four Piece Crib Set,I knew I wanted the color coral in my baby's nursery. When I started searching for baby bedding this was one of the first sets that I found. I thought it was so cute. I was very surprised with the price. Majority of the other bedding sets were around $200. This was $82. It shipped to my home in just a few days and its just as cute in person. If you want girlie without all the pink then this is perfect. Love it.,5,1
Kidsme Food Feeder Essential Set,"It's been great fun introducing my daughter to new foods using these. They are great. Good quality, easy to clean, the perfect size. When my daughter is teething we put frozen carrots in one and give it to her to gnaw on. She loves it.",5,1
"[Award winning] Kidsme Food Feeder (Small size),  Blue/Yellow","This product is perfect!!! You'll love it and your baby too! :). You can put anything in this thing, in small potions of course but it gets the job done. Your happy the baby is happy and life goes on happily ever after",5,1
"[Award winning] Kidsme Food Feeder (Small size),  Blue/Yellow","Love the idea! the materials are good, and seems well built, and cleans in a snap, haven't tried the mesh feeders, didn't like the idea of them, or how hygienic they could be. The handles are perfect for my 5 months old baby boy, but will get small very fast, doesn't matter, there is enough of a handle to grab on single handed, even if that is not the original idea.The small size really is small,  it doesn't hold much, about a single slice of banana, so I need to refill it pretty fast, it will keep him busy for a couple of minutes at most, don't know how it will work with firmer fruit, but should keep him busy for a little longer. Size seemed to be a big issue with most reviews I read before deciding on buying this, so I bought the small size, and the large replacement sacs, will use them latter on. They are small, but I don't see them being longer since baby could choke if he tries to stuff the whole thing in his mouth. I think is functional, works and cleans well, and most important baby enjoys it, and can self feed, even if its just for a couple of minutes at a time.My baby was both breast fed and bottle fed, so it wasn't difficult for him to get used to this, He is barely starting on fruits, first spoon fed with applesauce, and then decided to try the feeder with banana, first try, he had his &#34;what is this stuff you are giving me look&#34; at the second attempt he snatched it away from me, so I guess he liked it, and the face is from the banana and not the feeder in itself.I like the idea, of being able to give my baby pieces of fruits and not to have to worry about him getting choked on them. I do recommend this feeder, and will give one to my sister for her baby, but if you want to give your baby a bigger serving of fruit in one go, this feeder is not for you.",5,1
"Owl , Squirrel Porcupine Tree Top Friends Single Toggle Switch Wall Plate Cover Switchplate","This switch plate is NOT plastic its metal. So it's very durable, made of great quality, and easily cleaned if needed without worrying if the decals are going to come off like most cheap light switch plates I have seen. It fits my baby's nursery just perfectly. In fact it would go with any room based on the Dena Happi Tree design.",5,1

Jolly Jumper Arctic Sneak A Peek Infant Car Seat Cover Black,"After reading reviews on every cover that I could find, I purchased this cover for my then 5 month old son. I LOVE this cover and still use it (he is almost 8 months old). It has been such as lifesaver. It fits our Chicco Keyfit perfectly, and we love the attached blanket. It is so nice not having to fight a cover in the wind and cold. Another PRO about this cover is that it only covers the top of the carseat, it DOES NOT go in between the baby and the carseat, as this can be unsafe. It is like a little cocoon and it keeps my son so warm. He is longer now and his feet reach the end of the cover, but it is still tight enough that he does not kick it off. I am so glad that I found this cover and will definitely be keeping this for my next baby.",5,1
Jolly Jumper Arctic Sneak A Peek Infant Car Seat Cover Black,I have a Graco Click Connect 35 and this fits on it perfectly.  It's very easy to put on and remove for washing.  I don't find the canopy or the handle getting in the way.  I can get my baby in and out of the car seat with ease.  I washed it and there was no shrinkage whatsoever and it fit back on just as snug as before the wash.  I love the blanket inside.  It really keeps my baby warm and toasty.,5,1
Kids Preferred Eric Carle Activity Very Hungry Caterpillar Baby Toy,I ordered this for my new grandson. His room is decorated with Very Hungary Caterpillar things and this was the perfect gift.,5,1

"Obersee Kids Rolling Luggage with Integrated Snack Cooler, Rhinestone Angel Wings","These worked well for our travels and they fit under the airline seat perfectly.  Pleased with the suitcase and would order again.  I got my son the football one, though, and his handle was a bit different in that he pinched his fingers twice.  Not sure why there would be a design difference.  Overall, though, really loved them and would order again.",5,1
"Diono RadianR100 Convertible Car Seat, Dune",Just what the title says...Perfect for our tall 4yr old.That is all I have to say at this time.,4,1
"Diono RadianR100 Convertible Car Seat, Dune","This is a longer review, with more specifics than I would usually post. I was very appreciative of the details others put in their reviews - car make and model, positioning of the car seats, age of children, safety features, etc. Hopefully this will help some others with the same dilemma we had.We'd been using a toddler car seat and an infant cradle seat in the backseat of our small SUV (BMW X3), and with the two car seats, we couldn't put a passenger in the back seat as well. I wanted to avoid, if possible, the hassle, expense, and reduced sustainability of upgrading to a larger vehicle So after months of research, and the little one growing out of her first car seat, we decided to get two of these. They fit perfectly, and although I have to put the passenger front seat forward a bit, I can still sit there comfortably with the Radian R100 rear-facing (for reference, I'm 5' 7&#34;). Both little ones love it, so it must be comfy, despite being the more basic model. My husband, an engineer and former fire fighter, was very impressed with the engineering of the seats and the safety features. They were also very quick to install. He had them both correctly installed in about 30 minutes. I was really glad to see all the reviews saying that one could fit three carseats or two car seats and a passenger in the back seats of Corollas, Jettas, and Camrys. I think our back seat is about the same as a Corolla. Although there were mentions of the side head wings on other models being better for napping, our little ones seem to have ample room to lean their heads to one side and snooze. So in our experience, napping in the car is still possible with this model - I'd been a bit worried about that, but it isn't an issue.I'm now able to easily and swiftly buckle in the little ones, which is very different from our previous car seats. I would also recommend the dry seat protector (sold separately). It's an excellent fit, with good protection provided. So glad to have found a super-safe car seat which has a narrow width and can fit three across even in smaller vehicles!",5,1
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum",Easy to install (albeit it is heavy-lifting into the car)Fits perfectly & is very comfortable!I highly recommend this product!  So worth the money.,5,1
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum",We love this product. One of the main reasons why we purchased this was how slim this seat was. It fits perfectly in the back of our Camry and allows another infant car seat to be put next to it. That wasn't possible with our old Evenflo. It's extremely sturdy and makes it easy for our son to climb in the seat on his own. We'll be purchasing another one for our daughter when she graduates to a big girls' seat. Would definitely recommend this car seat to everyone!,5,1
"Infant 2.4ghz Digital Video/Audio Baby Monitor System with 2.4&quot; LCD Display Optics, 8 IR LEDs for upto 15ft Night Vision, FHSS Radio Transmission, Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery for Monitor, Voice Activated Power Saving Mode (PINK)","This monitor is really good.  Our room and our baby's room are about 60 feet from each other.  The unit has zero (0) static.  It works perfect.  It's fun to watch her from across the house to see what's going on.If I have a beef with this machine...it's only one.  The unit enjoys shutting itself down after three minutes.  There is no 'continuous mode' on this unit.  I know...'Why would you want it to stay on?'  Very Simple.  This unit is VERY small and can be moved around.  So, when I have computer work to do, I can put her in the swing, on the other side of the room...set the camera up so I can see her...come back to the computer, and use the clip on the back of the monitor to 'mount' it on upper right (top) of the computer monitor.  I can type blogs and monitor her at the same time.  However...I have to push the 'P' button every three minutes to wake it back up.I like this unit so much, I've purchased a second whole unit for me.  Her room unit will live in the there...my unit will be a floater unit.  Can't wait for it to come in.Highly recommend this unit!!!!",5,1
"SugarBooger Kiddie Lunch Sack, Paper Doll",was looking for a snack bag to put my daughters snacks in and when i spotted this i knew it would be perfect. very well made & very pretty!,5,1
"SugarBooger Kiddie Play Backpack, Paper Doll","I bought two of these backpacks, one as a birthday gift for a two year old girl, and one as a Christmas gift for my daughter who is just shy of two.  The two year old loved it and it was the perfect size for her frame. The backpack was a bit much for my 19-month old, but as she grows closer to two years old, she is more interested in wearing it. It doesn't hold much, perhaps four or five, small to medium sized books. It doesn't have any interior/exterior pockets, so this wouldn't be the book bag for an elementary school child. But for a 2 or 3 year old child, for library trips, this does the trick and make them feel like a ""big kid"".",5,1
"Diono Radian Travel Bag, Black","Not sure why this bag gets slammed in the reviews, it comes with 2 travel straps, has held up for 3 flight throough 3 different airlines (and we have 2 bags for our two car seats), and it still looks new. My only gripe is the Dino Radian car seat is a BEAST--it is heavy to carry around in its bag, but the bag does a great job of protecting the car seat and it fits snugly and perfectly!",5,1
"Urban Infant Tot Cot Daycare, Planet",I bought this for my daughter to use at her new preschool. It fits the cots perfectly and the teachers love the elastic bands that hold it in place. It's light weight and easy for my daughter to carry herself.  The fabric is cute and it seems well made.  I did accidentally forget to take the pillow out when I washed it last week and as a result the pillow is now lumpy. I won't do that again!,5,1
Sassy Ring O' Links 2 Pack,1) Baby loves playing with the rings2) Perfect for hanging / linking other toys to the stroller / cot / playgym,5,1
The Grandparent Gift Co. Daddy's Love Frame,This is the perfect picture frame for my office and not necessarily for the grandparent.  Daddy loves this one too.,5,1
The Grandparent Gift Co. Holiday All I want for Christmas Ultrasound Ornament,We got this as a Christmas present to announce that we were expecting baby #2.  It was perfect.  Grandpa and Grandma were thrilled and very very surprised plus they had a keepsake.  The only thing is that the photo area is pretty small so if you are looking to do this I would suggest you try to get the ultrasound lady to give you a picture where they are 'zoomed out' a little more otherwise you'll end up only showing part of of your baby in the photo area.,5,1
PRK Products Inc Universal Baby Bottle and Sippy Cup Organizer,"Okay I am a big diapers.com girl so this was my first purchase on Amazon because I have heard about this product from several of my friends and dipaers.com currently does not sell it.  I also am one of those people that does a ton of research before purchasing a product. Of course this is done when Brandt is put down to bed (lol...).Okay, so I found this product reviewed on SEVERAL sites. I was actually amazed at how many sites I did find it. The Baby Center is always my ""go to site"" if I really want to learn about a product. And as always, the baby center did not let me down. I also have read all the reviews that the people have posted to this site and this is what I am going to tell you.(1) It is super sturdy (2) It is kind of tall so i can see if you had an older kitchen it most likely would not fit in your kitchen cabinets. It would not fit in my Mother's but fits perfectly in mine. I would still suggest purchasing it even if you have to have it on your counter, a pantry would work great as well (3) I would not say it saves you a lot of space BUT what it does do is solve the falling bottles problem when you open up your kitchen cabinet doors. Which is one of my favorite parts about this product. Now I can reach in to grab a bottle with ease -vs.- knocking ones all over the place (4) I can see what people are taking about when they talk about the bottles not always dropping down. this is true, once in awhile it kind of catches but honestly it takes a half of a second to flick it with your finger to resolve the issue. And like I said, it happens only once and awhile...and who cares when it does, it is not a big deal.(5) I love that it works with sippy cups as well. For ONCE my money spent on a baby product will last me for a few years which is really hard to come by when dealing with baby products. Brandt is only in bottles so I have not tried it yet with sippy cups but cannot imagine it not working great. (6) Okay, the whole I like my bottles put together issue. I am a gal that always stores my nipples and lids apart from the bottles. When my bottles come out of the dishwasher they have that wet stuff still inside so the last thing I want to do is cap it in .... YUCK!  And of course, I do not want to try to stick a towel in there and dry it all the way so my stuff is always stored apart. This organizer is great for that because it helps dry the bottles so to speak as well as the basket because of the holes. This is a huge selling point for me -vs.- some of the other moms who like to store it all together.  by the way, it does store my prince lionheart 7 oz bottles with all the bells and whistles so maybe you have to have one of those super tall bottles to not let it fit???I really think this is a great product and I am very happy that I purchased it.  I hope my two cents worth helps :-)",5,1
"Lifefactory 2 Pack Multi Sensory Silicone Teether, Sky/Spring Green",I love lifefactory bottles so gave these a shot. Perfect for my teething five month old to hold and bring to her month and chop down! Love them.,5,1
"Lifefactory 2 Pack Multi Sensory Silicone Teether, Sky/Spring Green","At first I didn't want to order these because of the steep price tag! Who really wants to spend $14 for 2 teething rings?! But I bought them anyway as a Christmas gift for my 4 month old daughter. Poor thing has been teething since she was two months old. She ends up chewing on her fingers most of the time because that is what is accessible to her. We opened these up for her (I washed them before wrapping) and instantly she stared at it, reached out and grabbed it, pulled it to her mouth and veraciously attacked it!! Her hand eye coordination isn't the greatest cuz she's only 4 months, but we were working on it tonight with this teether! Over several hours she only dropped it twice! If it did fall out of her hand it usually went around her arm, then when she'd put her arm down she would feel it as it fell over her hand. She'd stare at it for a second then bring it back to her mouth! It's silicone so it squishes easily. She had it contorted into all sorts of shapes because she'd bite it and stretch or squish it all at the same time! She bit with her front &#34;teeth&#34; and back &#34;teeth&#34; so it was small enough to get back there, but it stays wide enough that it's not gonna go down the throat! It is the perfect size to stretch over my wrist to wear as a bracelet so I always have it on hand for her, or just a convenient, hands free place to hold it! I also love that it's made in Racine, WI! Right here in the US! All that being said, I've read some reviews on this about how pieces can break off, but if you just inspect it before each use (like you should any way) that shouldn't be a problem! Also, it is silicone, it attracts hair, but again, inspect it, pull it off and build your child's immunity! For us, this product is definitely worth the price and I would buy it again in a heartbeat!",5,1
"Lifefactory 2 Pack Multi Sensory Silicone Teether, Sky/Spring Green","My daughter started teething at just over 4 months.  This have been amazing for her. She loves to chew on these rings.  Sometimes I put them in the freezer so that they are cold when I first give them to her.  The packaging said they could be chilled in the freezer but don't expect them to stay cold for long.  She loves to rub her gums back and forth over the different textures. They are also lightweight and easy to attach to a pacifier clip so that she can't toss it over the side of her car seat/stroller/bouncy seat.Overall, these are absolutely perfect for any teething baby!!",5,1
"Lifefactory 2 Pack Multi Sensory Silicone Teether, Sky/Spring Green",These were perfect for my teething baby. We tried several teethers and these were the first ones we found that he could hold easily on his own and weren't too hard to chew on.,5,1
"Lifefactory 2 Pack Multi Sensory Silicone Teether, Sky/Spring Green","Man, it is so tough to find GOOD teethers that my baby likes, that aren't plastic. I saw these on Amazon and took a chance; my son loved them, so I ordered another pack to make sure I always had a clean one on hand. All the little nubs seem to keep him stimulated, and the shape is perfect for chubby hands to hold. My son got his first tooth a little on the early side (4 1/2 months) and he is ALWAYS looking for something to stick in his mouth. I like to put these on pacifier clips when he's in his car seat so he has something to keep him occupied. They are easy to wash (I just throw them in a soaking bin in the kitchen sink along with his bottles/breast pump parts) and dry quickly. I haven't had any cracking issues at all.",5,1
"Kids Line All Around Bumper, Dena Happi Tree","I bought these bumpers for my daughter's nursery and I couldn't be happier with them! I loooove owls but I wanted something feminine and pretty. The paisley print and cutesy owls sold me right away. They are stinkin cute!! I didn't want the whole package as I made a crib skirt, bought softer sheets and hate diaper stackers, so I just didn't need all the other stuff. Good quality fabric, not cheaply made so I'm okay with the price I paid for them seperately. I did buy a few coordinating items to go with the theme of the room and so far have loved them all (hamper, lamp, changing pad cover, wall canvases)...I have yet to wash the bumpers, so I may come back and update depending on how they wash out but....they meet all my expectations so far! Fabric colors are as depicted, bright and cheery!  The ties on the corners are not quite long enough for a bow as some others have mentioned but I didn't expect them to be. The stitching and owl / flower appliques are adorable and sewn precisely. Sometimes things like that are a little wacky when mass produced, these are perfect. Overall, I love them. I think my lil'girl will too!! Lots of fun things to look at from her view...She's not due for another month but these are a great touch to her room!! :)",5,1
"Kids Line All Around Bumper, Dena Happi Tree","I love the bumper, it was a the perfect fit and the colors are absolutely perfect mix. I am so glad I decided to go with the Dena Happi Tree theme. 100% happy with my purchase!",5,1
green sprouts Baby Bath Mat,I bought this so I could continue to give my son a bath in the kitchen sink. He outgrew his bath lounger and is able to sit with help. The sink is cold and slippery (cast iron) and this solved both of those problems. It worked perfectly!,5,1
Living Textiles Baby Lampshade &amp; Base - Lil' Sprout,I purchased this lamp for my newborn grandson's nursery.  My daughter decorated his room in the Babies R U &#34;B is for Bear&#34; motif and this lamp fit in so closely.  She wanted a small lamp for nighttime feedings and this fit the bill perfectly.  So cute and extremely affordable.  Could not find anything close to it in any of the stores in my area.  So glad I came across this.,4,1
Contours Classique 3-in-1 Wood Bassinet,"Overall we are very pleased with this purchase. We needed a bedside sleeper that very narrow, and this fits perfectly. I was worried that there would manufacturing issues after reading some of the other reviews, but it was in perfect condition when we received it.  My husband easily put it together.  I would definitely recommend this bassinet.",5,1
"Newco Kids Redondo Chair, Minky Zebra","Our 6yo who's into zebra print absolutely loved this. Wide enough for little kids, perfect proportion. Max age probably is 8yo. Our 9yo also liked it but she's already too big for it.",4,1
SoHo - Sage Diaper bag with changing pad 6 pieces set,"Great size, nice color, everything fits perfect.Would definitely recommend to others.Anyone who purchases this item wont regret it.",5,1
Em's 4 Bubs Hearing Protection Baby Earmuffs Size 0-18 Months (Black),"Love them, 9 month old wore them for a 5 day festival.BUY FROM VENDOR: JUNNII made 2 prior orders and only got the band, this was isolated to a vendor, last try I used JUNNI on amazon and order was perfect!Took a few tries to find a stable location on his head but once we found the sweet spot he wore them for hours with no issues.Back of strap very low by neck, front very high on forehead in hair. They work like a charm and the crowds love seeing your kids wearing them. Hundreds of photos.",5,1
"Boon Stem Grass and Lawn Drying Rack Accessory,Yellow",Perfect to hold all the small pieces (like the medela pump small parts) so they don't fall into the grass.,5,1
"Boon Stem Grass and Lawn Drying Rack Accessory,Yellow",I got  this for my boon grass and love it. I don't bottle feed much but I pump milk often and the little stamen on this flower are perfect for the rubber valves and such. It also brings some cohesion to the funny little patch of grass near my coffee pot.,5,1
"The Rockabye Glider Serenity Ottoman, Chenille Tan",I am thrilled with this ottoman and matching glider!  It's high quality and incredibly soft and plush.  I purchased this from Amazon because I was irritated with the expensive delivery fees from a popular baby store.  With Amazon it was delivered for free within a week in perfect condition.  I highly recommend this product!!,5,1
"The Rockabye Glider Sunny Recliner, Micro Tan",It looks great in our nursery.  Only complaint is that it isn't easy to sleep in because the back doesn't stay down very well.  For normal night time feedings and rocking its perfect though!,5,1
"The Rockabye Glider Sunny Recliner, Micro Tan","I got this for my second child because I regret not having one with my first. It was easy to set up and looks great. I love the recline, and the fact that the foot rest goes down with pressure from your legs so when you are holding baby you don't have to use your hand to move the handle. The gliding motion is smooth, it's not as large as a la z boy but has room for my large frame, the back is firm and the perfect height (I'm 5'7""), and I love the swivel motion. This is the perfect chair for any nursery!",5,1
"Newco International Grand Glider, Bella Velvet Beige",Purchased this chair in aqua - without ever seeing or sitting in it! It's perfect! And the aqua color is gorgeous! Very comfortable and goes perfectly in our playroom.,5,1
Snack Happened Preppy Plaid Snack Bag 7&quot; by Itzy Ritzy,"I use these for my 5 year old son's lunchbox and snack bag.  I hate using regular plastic bags and having to throw them in the trash, hurting the environment.  These snack bags are perfect for reusing daily for sandwiches, chips, dried fruit, whatever!  And super cute to boot!",5,1
"Baby Brezza Temperature Control Kettle, White/Grey",I love this kettle!  It warms to the perfect temp quickly & maintains it all day. I would recommend that you buy one bc it is certainly worth the $$!,5,1
"Dena Happi Tree Hamper, Pink","Matches the bedding set perfectly and can hold LOTS of clothes.  The mesh bag insert helps keep air flowing so if something is a little damp, it won't mildew.  The bag also removes easily so I can just carry the whole load to the washer without dropping a thing.",5,1
Nook Pebble ChangePad,The cover of this changing pad is hydrophobic and it is just perfect.  I have washed it already and it looks like new.,5,1
"Boba 3G Baby Carrier, Montenegro Black","I was lucky enough to discover a place where you can rent a baby carrier before purchase. I did a trial with the Boba 3G, Ergo Classic, and Ergo Sport. Before the trial, I was pretty certain that I would LOVE the Ergo Sport because that specific model had a vent, detachable hood, and 3 carry positions (back, hip, and front). Well, I found the hip carry to be completely useless. It became very uncomfortable after a few minutes. I didn't like the way the strap sat on my shoulder and rubbed against my neck in that position. Also, the vent made little difference when it came to keeping the baby cool. The Ergo Classic had super soft fabric (definitely a plus) but I didn't like the hood (which is not detachable). Also the seat was a little shallow for my baby who is shaped like the cutest string bean ever.NOW THE BOBA. I LOVE that it was so easy to put on. The Boba fit me and my husband perfectly. My husband is 6' 4"" and slender and I am 5' 7"" and voluptuous (my way of saying that I still have baby weight to lose). We were both very comfortable wearing it. The carrier distributes weight very evenly and I didn't experience any back pain. I also like the way the top strap adjusts-- it easily slides up and down but is secure.  I love that it has an adjustable hood. Also, the Boba has a higher panel (deep seat), so I felt that my baby was better supported in it. I think the Boba will better accommodate her as she grows. Lastly, for the next baby, I can use the Boba without an insert (unlike the Ergo).The only minus-- I liked the fabric on the Ergo better BUT the Boba is constructed from very durable fabric and felt high quality.Overall, it's a great carrier.",5,1
New Boba Wrap in Red with Matching Carrying Pouch : Infant Baby Carrier : Preemie - 18months (Previously Sleepy Wrap),This is an absolute lifesaver! Love it. Fabric and price were perfect for me. If your child is warm blooded be aware that it can get warm but it's worth it to have both hands free and know your child is safely wrapped.,5,1
New Boba Wrap in Red with Matching Carrying Pouch : Infant Baby Carrier : Preemie - 18months (Previously Sleepy Wrap),"I love this. True to color and very comfortable. I do not have another brand to compare it to, but I do feel like, while the stretch provides comfort and ease, you do have to re-do it fairly often. I would always have to keep a hand on my daughter (even at newborn stage), because it would really begin to sag. If you have a baby that really loves to be extremely tight and you get really good at tying it, this would probably be perfect. I still used it and I still think I would prefer the stretch to none at all, but it's not 100% hands-free in my opinion. It is super soft and I do enjoy using it!",4,1
"Combi Cosmo DX Lightweight Stroller, Sunset Scribble","I am a 73yr. old grandmother and purchased this stroller because I was looking for a lightweight stroller.  I love this stroller which is perfect for my 1 month old grandchild.  It reclines all the way back and the baby can lie almost flat.  I had ordered another one for my previous grandchild and seldom used it because the baby had to be able to almost sit up since it didn't recline flat.  I was even able to put it together by myself.  The parents use one that the car seat fits into but that arrangement is way too heavy for me to use.  I do not plan to collapse it as I put it into my car upright, so I have no comment about its collapsibility.  I am extremely pleased with this puchase!",5,1
"Combi Cabria DX Lightweight Stroller, Sutton Place","Pros:- It is lightweight- Reasonably priced for all the things I wanted in a stroller (1 bar handle, drink holder for me at the top, some type of storage on top-it has a velcro bag to store small things, a larger canopy, compact, lightweight,cup holder/snack tray for my son)- Compact. I like that when it is folded in the trunk of my SUV that it doesn't take up much space since it folds like an umbrella stroller- I like that it has a carrying strap in the back of the stroller that I can use when traveling with my son.  It makes carrying him and carrying the stroller easy when the stroller is not in use- Narrow so it makes moving through narrow aisles at the stores easy- The height of the stroller is perfect.  I am 5'5"" so it is the perfect height and my back doesn't get sore pushing the stroller- LOVE that the canopy comes down further.  My son is 7 months old and he is so small in the stroller, so having the canopy go further down, it protects him from the sun.Cons:- The space/basket under the stroller is hard to get to and small so it doesn't hold that much things- The wheels are not made well so after 1 month of getting it I had to replace the back wheel and trying to get a hold of Combi is not the easiest since by the time I am ready to call, they are closed.- Folding it closed...forget about trying to do it with one hand.  You would need to put baby in the car seat then use 2 hands, make sure the front wheels are placed a certain way, before folding it closed- I wish there is a way that the storage at the top (the velcro bag) is attached more permanently for safety reasons.  It is easy for someone to take it off the stroller, so I am not too sure if I want to put my keys or cell phone in there.Overall:I would recommend buying this stroller again.  I just wish that Combi would look into making the wheels of their strollers better and of higher quality as well as look into making the basket under the stroller easier to access and maybe larger.",4,1
Eric Carle's The Very Hungry Caterpillar &amp; Apple Night Light,The lamp and the shade go perfectly with the Hungry Cata pillar theme.I definitely recommend this Eric Carle product.,5,1
"Badger Basket Three Drawer Hamper/Storage Unit, Espresso/Brown",Absolutely perfect! Very easy to assemble.  Love it!,5,1
10 Piece Baby Rattle and Teether Toy Gift Set with Giant Baby Bottle Coin Bank,"bought it for my 3 month old. obviously she'll have to grow some more to enjoy half of the toys from the set but 4 of them are perfect in shape, weight and rattling qualities for her!set is exactly what i was looking for:lightweight, enough rattling, basic oldshool rattles, nothing fancy. came in a nice bottle shape box she could probably play with later. not sure hot durable all those toys are bt it will definitely work it's price off so for me it was good buy)",4,1
Twooth Timer Twooth Timer,"This small timer is wonderful for our whole family. It's a great size, simple but whimsical design, understated on the counter, works perfectly. Our child now enthusiastically allows us to brush teeth for the allotted time and won't let us STOP until the bell rings. &#34;TWO MINUTES, MOM!!&#34; It is charming.Seems to be quite sturdy and has held up to playing, tossing around...Highly recommended!",5,1
"Bumbo Toilet Trainer, Pink","So cozy and safe feeling for my baby/toddler. Started using it at 12 months for fun, she sat in there all by herself with no problems. It's perfect for little bottoms (or chunky bottoms, in our case!), and we still use it into the early toddler-hood years so far. We bought a couple for different toilets.",5,1
"Skip Hop Moby Bath Kneeler, Blue",Really soft and thick. Works perfectly for kneeling by the tub to wash your little one. Also really cute and well made.,5,1
"Badger Basket Kid's Storage Bench with Cushion and Three Bins, Espresso",Its in the garage.  Collects items - but perfect for what we needed to keep the stuff out of the house!,4,1
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman","This is a very nice pack N play. It's easy to put up and take down and I love the changing station and infant sleeper area included. Since I'm a grandmother this time I don't need a stand alone changing table so this is perfect for us. I also like that the mattress can be placed higher up and on the bottom as the child gets older. I don't feel like I'm breaking my back trying to get an infant a few feet to the bottom this way. My only problem and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that when the mattress is in the higher position the area under the changing area seems to be raised higher than the area where nothing is over it. I've double checked and it's installed correctly but when you twist the changing pad over it rubs slightly on the mattress. This is definitely not a deal breaker, especially since it doesn't extend to where I lay her down for a nap. Soon she will be too old to have the mattress up this high anyway and it won't matter. Overall I love the look of this and the added changing table. It's sturdy and easy to use and packs up nicely if you want to store it.",4,1
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman",We were unsure on what we would use downstairs for changing baby and this is perfect. We use the napper all the time and have used it as a port-a-crib as well. I am very pleased with this buy.,5,1
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman",I like this pack n play and will keep it as this is our last baby ..: but I don't likeHow the bassinet attaches its kinda loose which makes me nervous. But with the weight if the baby it will stay in place just perfectly!,4,1
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman",We just received this today and love it! It is super easy to assemble and take down when needed. The colors are perfect for a gender neutral theme. We love the idea of the Napper/Changer combo and will be using this instead of a bassinet for our newborn.,5,1
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman","The ease of this pack n play is perfect, we have a newborn and only use the changer but it works well and baby loves sleeping in it!",5,1
"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Newborn Napper Station DLX, Jacqueline","We have decided to use this with our newborn. It is in our bedroom next to the bed. The bassinet is secure and comfortable. The nightlight is perfect for late night feedings. The added storage compartment is perfect for storing extra diapers and wipes.Assembly was a little difficult.  Be sure to assemble in the room you plan to use it in.The wheels make it easy to move around the room once assembled; however, it does not fit through doorways.",5,1
"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Newborn Napper Station DLX, Jacqueline","It took my husband about 45 minutes to assemble but the end result is amazing. The color combination is so neutral and perfect for our baby girl. The true test will be when she gets to sleep on this napper but overall, it seems sturdy and well-made. The vibration, lights, and music is an amazing touch. You won't regret this purchase :)",5,1
"Tadpoles One Bulb Shaded Chandelier, Pink","I hung one on each side of our bed in our master bedroom. They give just the right amount of light, soft and not glaring. Our room is Bordello-ish. More like western Bordello, and these are the perfect girly side to our oversized wood furniture, and red Bedspread. I love them. They are light and easy to hang. I do not think they are Large, as others have said. I think Medium is good. I love them... Perfect touch to a room that is both fem and Manly...",4,1
Tadpoles Dino Playmat Set,"This mat is so cute, and perfect for my new sitter. He loves the pattern and trying to pull out the pieces. And when he falls over it provides good padding. It wipes up nicely from any messes, and as long as you don't make a practice of walking on it, it stays clean. I was worried it might be a little small, but actually it is perfect. It looks great in our living room too.",5,1
"Tadpoles Cats And Dogs Playmat Set, Pink","The squares fit perfectly together, they come with enough rounded end pieces to complete the look, and the plastic case they come in is reusable.  I purchased a play yard for my baby and put these beneath.  I ended up purchasing two packs however; a pack of 16 didn't cover enough floor space for me. I created a 30 square mat (two leftover small squares) and I love it; it's adorable!  I also think the padding is sufficient for when baby tips backwards; no tears, which is always a plus. Free shipping was very timely as well.  My only suggestion would be for the manufacturers to provide something akin to two-sided tape as my mat is on hardwood floors and shifts at times...but not terribly so.",5,1
"Thirsties Duo Diaper Snap, Mud, Size One (6-18 lbs)","First of all a few facts.Thirsties Duo Diapers .......do have gussets....do not leak....do have microfiber and cotton soaker pads....do dry fast, as the 2 different parts of the soaker come apart in the wash....do not have to be separated to wash. The soaker agitates out on its own....really are easy to stuff....have really strong snaps....have a stay dry fabric that touches baby's bottom, making for a very comfortable all night diaper....colors that are very true to the pictures on this site. And I do love the colors and prints.These diapers are absolutely awesome. I bought them ahead of time long before my son was born. He was 7 lbs 3 oz when he was born. The Thirsties Duo Diaper had a very comfortable fit, but was still slightly loose around the thighs, this caused them to leak just a little bit.By the time he was 3 weeks old, he weighed 10 lbs 2 oz. That is when I started him in these for real. They fit so well around his legs. They are not that bulky, they are extremely absorbent, and best of all they DO NOT leak! Thirsties Duo Diapers, like the Thirsties Duo Wraps have gussets that keep even the biggest newborn explosions inside the diaper where it belongs. The diapers also do not get wet on the outside like some diapers do, even tho the pul side of the diaper is very soft and squishy.He is now 6 weeks old and slightly over 11 lbs. The diaper still fits, but is on the very last setting with both snaps on the diaper. This is the only Con this diaper has. The snaps are beside each other. This really limits the sizing in my opinion. I can see these as fitting for a little bit yet if my baby would lengthen and not get any fatter. But the problem is, my baby will get fat. All my babies are fat. They are fat, roly poly little snugglers. So I need a diaper that has a broad range of fit.If you have babies who are long and not so roly poly then this wold be (in my opinion) the perfect diaper for you. They are soft, cozy and very comfortable for baby. But for me, I will sadly have to trade these diapers for an option with a longer and better fit for a fat baby. These are my second favorite diaper ever.The diapers I have tried are Bumkins, Bumgenius, Fuzzibunz, Swaddlebees, Itty Bitty's, and a few more brands that I can not remember.",4,1
"Graco SnugRide Classic Connect DLX Infant Car Seat, Oasis","Wonderful car seat!  When I was having my first baby this was the #1 rated for safety (back in 2008) - it suited her perfectly and has lasted now all the way through my second, who has just finished using this again.  The strap adjustment in the front makes it a breeze to use, and I also didn't even use the base in my car with the second, just strapped her in with the seatbelt every time - so portable and easy.  Admittedly this doesn't have a bunch of bells and whistles - pretty basic, but with a couple other accessories will suit your need perfectly.  I recommend the snuzzler for the newborn stage when they are really tiny, and also some velcro cloth wraps for the straps at the neck if they'r on the chubbier side - by the time my 2nd was 8 months they would rub against her neck pretty good, so I just wrapped those around and problem solved.  Love this car seat and will be keeping it for (hopefully) a third baby!!",5,1
"Boon Swap Baby Utensils,Blue/Orange","Okay, that sounds like an exaggeration, but I have 4 kids spanning 16 years.  Every baby spoon I have found was short handled and most had spoons that were too large and round for a baby learning to eat solids.  This baby spoon is perfect, from the length of the handle down the the size of the spoon.  You have to try it, you won't be sorry!",5,1
"Boon Swap Baby Utensils,Blue/Orange",If you're on the fence trying to weigh out the cost for 2 spoons... I was too! SO SOO glad I bought these! They are great and gentle on baby! Perfect shape so I don't have to balance food to keep it on the spoon (stage 1 foods are almost liquid.) These are great and quality!,5,1
"Boon Naked Collapsible Baby Bathtub, Blue/White","Awesome! Easy and perfect for a one bath 4 person family, I can fold it up and hangs on the back of the door. Oh and the sponge recommended by others is not necessary if you have a 10 lb newborn! He does just fine without it!",5,1
"Graco UrbanLite Stroller, Rittenhouse","Its easy to assamble, the color is perfect for boy or girl, and cover the sun and baby perfect!easy to close it , i really like it",5,1
"Graco RoomFor2 Stand and Ride Classic Connect Stroller, Metropolis",I bough this for my 7 month old baby and my 3 year old girl and it works really good. Its really easy to move around and it is really easy to fold up.  Both my girls seem to be very comfortable.  I also love that its not a huge stroller because before I thougth about getting a double stroller but it just seemed too big and this stroller is just perfect...,5,1
"My Brest Friend Pregnancy Wedge, Sunburst","This wedge is perfect for second trimester comfort while sleeping on your side.  I highly recommend it.  It's got huge tags on it that you may want to cut off.  I haven't bothered yet, though.",5,1
"Graco ComfortSport Convertible Car Seat, Zara","This car seat is just as great as i had expected.  We purchased one in 2010 for our now 3 yr old and his 9 month old brother is using it now.  This one was purchased for our 9 month old daughter, yes twins!  We decided to purchase this since we had already purchased the one and loved it. The cushion inserts are different in this than our previous one but i love them.  Also the elastic around the edge of the fabric cover is different(stretches more) but still works perfectly.  All children are happy in the seats and they are nice and soft.  I would buy this car seat over and over again!",5,1
"Graco ComfortSport Convertible Car Seat, Zara","I love this car seat so far. It fits my son perfectly and with plenty of foot room rear-facing. The straps easily adjust as well, which is a huge bonus since some straps give one such trouble. Not these! Great purchase and worth your money. It also looks pretty sharp!",5,1
"Graco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Rane","This is a fabulously comfortable car seat, my daughter loves it.  It sets her up high and gives her lots of cushion and padding.  I love the headrest- it actually works to keep her head upright, even when asleep.  It is thick enough to offer support- our newborn carrier/carseat just had a little flimsy headrest.  The cup holders are awesome, and the LATCH system makes it super easy to install in my car or my husband's truck.  Added bonus- my daughter loves the color!  Fits her personality perfectly!",5,1
"Graco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Rane",I LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH! I HAVE A 9 MONTH OLD AND SHE FITS PERFECT INTO IT AND LOVES IT AS WELL. I HAVE TWO NOW AND RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO WANTS A SAFE AND CUTE CARSEAT!,5,1
"Graco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Rane","This seat met most of my &#34;must have&#34; features, but it is HUGE. I have a Honda Accord 2006 and the seat fits perfectly fine both rear-facing and forward-facing in the center seat. The only problem is there isn't a comfortable amount of room for passengers on either side. The cup holders/armrests stick out far enough to make you have to lean to the side while in the back.My son loves sitting in it and he is a busy-body. He loves the pillow for his head and the cup holders on either side. He can easily fall asleep in it which is what I was looking for for long car rides.",4,1
"Graco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Rane","We recently purchased this car seat for our 20 month old daughter who hadn't quite grown out of her toddler seat but needed something a bit more comfy for a long car ride over the holidays. I will admit one of my main reasons for getting this seat was my familiarity and favor for Graco products but also for it's forward facing capabilities. Unfortunately I drive a 2001 Toyota Tundra extended cab which at the time was the biggest but does not have 4 full doors or the full back seat so we can't rear face. That being said it fit perfectly, I had it inspected at the local police department and they only had to tighten it a little. Our daughter loves seeing where we are going now, she sticks cups, snacks and small stuffed animals in her newly acquired cup holders and she seems to like and enjoy this new seat very well.",5,1
"Graco Classic Ride 50 Convertible Car Seat, Boyton","Our 18-month daughter needed a rear-facing carseat with more room than the Snugride 35 we had before.  This fits the bill perfectly.  She loved it the moment it came out of the box and seems to really enjoy car trips in it.It was reasonably easy to install with the LATCH system, although I had to prop up one end with some towels to get it to sit level enough.  The buckles and straps are very easy to handle and adjust, and the whole thing comes apart easily in case cleaning is necessary (I know this by personal experience in a story best left untold.)  The straps are plenty roomy to get a child in and out easily and quickly, even in a coat, and the straps are also really easy to loosen and tighten.We haven't been in an accident, so I can't say how well it would protect a child in that case. But from all appearances, it looks like it will do as well as anything else and better than most others.",5,1
Skip Hop Soapster Foaming Soap Dispenser,"I'm not sure why the previous reviewer is having problems keeping this attached to the bath rub. It comes with three options for mounting - a suction cup plate, an adhesive plate, and screws and dry wall anchors. I simply scrubbed the tiles I planned to attach this too really well, dried them off with a towel, and then pushed really hard. Bam - it's been stuck in place for a week now! This is really great - we use really expensive, organic baby wash and with this product it makes it last twice as long. It's very easy to use, although I will agree that the pump part that you push in to get foam might be a little hard for small hands. But since we are still the ones bathing our two little guys it's perfect for us.",5,1
"Graco Travel Lite Crib, Nyssa",I neede something a little smaller than a regular pack-and-play and the Travel Lite Crib is perfect.  The color and print are cute.  I would definitely recommend to others.,5,1
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Forecaster","What i love most about this chair is the removable top tray piece.  I personally love to dishwasher wash my tray and the removable top fits perfectly in the dishwasher.  the chair does recline a bit, which at first i thought was a useless feature.  That was until i had to administer some medication to a relucant child.  Reclining the LO made it much smoother!This chair folds up and cleans up extremely easy.  For those curious, there are wheels to roll it around, some were confused that it was stationary.  The wide back keeps the flying food from making it too far away from the eating area! LOL",5,1
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Forecaster","This chair is very light and easy to move around. The tray is the perfect height for pulling up to the dining room table for meals. It takes a bit of scrubbing to get food off the fabric, but the scrubbing doesn't seem to hurt it. The tray is easy to remove with one hand. The footrest doesn't really serve a purpose except as a crumb catcher since it is so far down.",5,1
Belly Bandit Womens,"Why didn't I buy this sooner!? 30 weeks pregnant, 5'5 & 185lbs and the large fit perfectly & should be the perfect size til I pop. If you are carrying low or having sciatic pain & discomfort, or are on your feet all day like I am- this provides immediate relief! These are genius!",5,1
Widgeon Snugaroo Infant Car Seat Cover DINOSAUR,This cover fits perfectly over both of our car seats and the design is so cute!  I also love that it came with the matching hat.  We cannot wait to use it once the weather is cold this winter!,5,1
Quicksmart 3-in1 Diaper Bag/Travel Bassinet-Black,"Purchased this in black and when i opened the box my first thought was, ""Why didn't they have something like this back when my babies were born?""This is perfect for someone with baby that is visiting a friend and when the baby begins to start fussing, instead of grabbing the baby and heading home for nap time, put the baby in a back room, in this little bassinet and continue your visit...Back in the old days, we would grab the baby and head home, or drive around hoping the baby would fall asleep...Now, with this particular item, you have a bed and diaper bag......Why wasn't this thing invented in the early 80's????",5,1
"KF Baby Table Corner Guard, White, 8pc, with kilofly Refrigerator Magnet","These are perfectly fine corner guards. They come in a simple plastic bag but use the same 3M tape like everyone else. I have bought a ""brand name"" version of these and they are identical. I have also used the Safety 1st style, which are huge, but a toddler can pull off easily. These are not so easy to come off but are smaller then the Safety 1st.",5,1
"KF Baby Finger Pinch Guard [Set of 5], with kilofly Refrigerator Magnet","Purchased these to keep my toddler from slamming the doors in the house and closeing them on her fingers, they are thick and work perfectly for the job, bonus is they are cuter then the solid white ones! Very happy!",5,1
"Rumina Hands-Free Pumping Bra &amp; Nursing Tank - White, Medium","I love love love this tank!  As a working mom who is both breastfeeding and pumping, this tank is perfect.  It makes pumping time so much less of a hassle when I am able to work at the same time.  And then... when I finally get home after a long day, it unsnaps easily for comfortable and cozy skin to skin nursing time with my little one.  Highly recommend!",5,1
"Dreambaby Blind Cord Wraps, Clear",Clear is hard to notice however works perfectly as intended to easily wrap the cords out of reach of curious hands,5,1
"OXO Tot Seedling Youth Booster Seat, Green","Got this one just yesterday - exactly what I expected. We have leather chairs so it works perfect. Simple, easy to clean, very nice green color, portable and good quality product. Our boy now enjoys sitting at the table with us :-)",5,1
"OXO Tot Seedling Youth Booster Seat, Green","I use this booster for my 1.5 year old, fully supervised. He likes the chair because he feels like a big boy up at the table and isn't strapped in. Please note that there are no straps with this booster so it wouldn't be good for kids that need to be strapped in. The cushion is much firmer than I expected, and I really like that. This will stand up to many years of sitting, and most likely more than one child using it. The whole thing is easy to clean. If we have pasta or something messy I simply spray it down with the kitchen sprayer and let it dry on a kitchen towel. The no slip grips work perfectly and grab onto both fabric and wood surfaces. Overall this is an easy to use, clean and durable seat that I am a proud owner of.",5,1
"OXO Tot Seedling Youth Booster Seat, Green",I needed a booster for my 5 year old and this was the perfect solution. Not only does it boost her up to the right height of our dining room table but it easily comes apart to clean or wipe down after meals. Folds up to be stored away.,5,1
"Diono SantaFe Car Seat Booster, Pink","I wanted the safest booster seat that I could fine, which didn't slide around in the car.  This one has Latch straps that work perfectly to lock the booster seat in place.  Great color combination too.  And most of all, it's very comfortable - my children fight over who will sit in it so there are no arguments about actually sitting in a booster seat rather than riding in a &#34;grown up' seat.  It's light and easy to carry on the plane as hand luggage when we travel and need a car seat at the other end.  Highly recommended for looks, comfort and safety.",5,1
"GroVia Hybrid Hook/Loop Shell Diaper, Surf, One Size","Love these cloth diapers. Grovia really thought of everything in their design. They are simple & easy to use. The Velcro only sticks to itself, there are little tabs to stick the Velcro under for washing. The snaps (to resize) are perfectly placed & do their job. They wash really well (I'm using Charlie's Soap) with no staining & they dry really really quickly. We also use disposables for on the go convenience. I can honestly say we've had more 'blow outs' & leaks with the disposables than with the cloth. They were a little bulky looking whe she was small, but now (about 3mos) they're looking more normal. I do wish they had more colors, sometimes it's hard to match the diaper & make it look like part of the outfit.",5,1
Seaside Monthly Baby Bodysuit Stickers,These were exactly what I was looking for. They show true to color and look perfect on my little ones shirts for photos!,5,1
Philips AVENT BPA Free Breastcare Essentials Set,Liked all the little goodies that it came with & the sturdy bad I refilled the bad with extra pads little stuff the baby might need along with an extra shirt & bra for leaking problems it was perfect used at the hospital & in diaper bag,5,1
"Philips AVENT Thermal Gel Pads, 2-Pack","Ordered this to bring relief. I purchased two 2-packs, one for warm and one for cold. Did not warm up well or stay warm. As far as cold use, worked perfectly.",4,1
"Zo&euml; b Organic Fantastic Anti-Plastic Dishes Set, Turquoise/Lime",the cup and plate are just the right size. The bowl seems a bit large but it is nonbreakable and that is what I wanted. I will say the plate never seems to come clean in the dishwasher so I have to hand wash it. But that doesn't take much time. I love the shape of the plate and the curved up edges which makes it easier for my two and a half grand daughter scoop food onto her spoon. I would recommend this set the size is so perfect and the fact that it is colorful and not a cartoon to be seen. Another big plus.,4,1
"Lassig Casual Twin Bag Multimix,ash","I'm a bag/purse person. Apparently I'm a very picky bag/purse person. I have tried out so many diaper bags in my 3.5 years of being a mother. I've tried bags by: Skip Hop, JJ Cole, Petunia Pickle Bottom, eBags, Coach, Vera Bradley, JuJuBe, Carters, Thirty-One...I'm sure there are others. I've tried backpacks, messengers, totes...  I feel like I've tried them all. I was beginning to think my perfect bag wasn't out there. I even had some custom made for me on etsy. Nice bags, but still missing something. I saw a different bag by this same company that looked promising. No reviews, so I was hesitant. I really liked the look of the bag, so I checked on a couple other sites to see if there were reviews. Still no. Luckily, one of the other sites had this bag. No reviews either, but something about this bag made me want to try it out. I ordered from a different site (I'm reviewing here so at least someone may benefit). I love it!  I got the black with the horizontal pattern. It's big, but doesn't feel huge. In it I put: three cloth diapers, a wet bag, a package of those little disposable diaper bags, wipes, two onsies, shorts and underwear for my toddler, a formula dispenser, two burp cloths, two bibs, and the bottle holder the bag comes with. It all fits inside and zips shut. The side pockets I put an Aden and Anais swaddle blanket in each one. The top of bag can't be snapped when the blankets are in the pockets, but that's okay. Also, the side pockets are big enough to hold two bottles each. Very roomy!  The bottle holder this thing comes with is very nice!  It holds two bottles with a little extra room to spare. There's a pacifier pouch that is divided and holds two pacifiers. There's also a little pouch I'm using for a small tube of lotion, some hand sanitizer, and nail clippers.  The straps on this are great!  They stay on my shoulder nicely and don't dig in. I don't feel like I'm losing circulation in my arm after five minutes of using the bag (I had this problem with several bags, that could just be me though). The straps are long enough I can throw the bag towards my back and it stays comfortably, or I just put it below my shoulder. Either way really is good. The back side of the bag has a strap that can be use to carry this bag almost like a cross body backpack. I'm not sure the right term. That carry is very comfortable also. I hate cross body bags usually because they go right between my breasts and look funny (sorry!). This bag doesn't do that. The bottom strap was accentuating the extra pudge I had on my belly, but I just pulled my shirt over it.  Still comfy, and the strap didn't dig into me. This strap is very long and adjustable. It does clip, but does not come off the bag. It adjusts tight enough that it doesn't just hang when not in use. I'm a person that has to bring too much with me wherever I go. This bag lets me do that!  Also, it fits below my Britax double stroller in the tiny basket. Even with all that stuff, it still fits. I'm so happy I took a chance on this bag!",5,1
"Carter's All Around Bumper, Jungle Jill","I was looking for a good bumper for my older pre-toddler so she wouldn't wake up as much. This works although doesn't perfectly fit the Pottery Barn crib that we have. Since I didn't want to spend more money on a Pottery Barn bumper and this one came recommended, I decided to give it a try and it works. It is super cute and washes easily.  Wish it was longer for the two long panels and that the ties were longer. I would buy this product again and am more than happy with it for the price and quality.",4,1
"Balboa Baby Stroller Liner, Red Poppy",This fits the Britax B-Agile perfectly. It does cover the pull strap for folding but it is easily accessible through the hole the crotch strap comes through.The liner does move around a bit and needs to be repositioned but it takes just a second to tug back into place and is way easier than spot cleaning my stroller.It washes well and didn't shrink. I put it in the dryer for 10 minutes and then let it air dry the rest of the way.I don't recommend it for the Britax B-Ready. The B-Ready has a narrow seat and this liner is too wide for it.,4,1
"North States Supergate Ergo Safety Gate, Ivory",The gate is sturdy and slides easily to fit different size doorways.  The height is perfect for keeping my lab in one room.,5,1
"North States Supergate Ergo Safety Gate, Ivory","I have a room in my house, without a traditional doorway.  One side of the opening is a wall, and the other side is the bottom of the stairway railing.  I have been looking for a gate that I could install in this odd area, that did not require making holes in the wood of the stairway.  I have the gate pressure mounted, since the area is at the bottom of the stairway and there is no risk of falling down the steps.This gate works perfectly for that application.  The plastic is of nice quality, and is a subtle cream color.  The holes are too small for my toddler to easily get her toes into, so I do not have to worry about her climbing it.  I am very pleased with this safety gate.",5,1
"Bumkins Dr. Seuss 2 Piece Pajama Set, Green/Yellow, 12 Months","Ordered this for my son.  His favorite book at the moment is Green Eggs & Ham.  I ordered in size 24 months.  He's a little small for his age 2.5 yrs old.  The shirt fits perfect and the pants are a little long, but not bad.  Received in less than a week from ordering.  Overall, satisfied.",5,1
"Bumkins Dr. Seuss Short Sleeve Toddler Tee, Blue Cat in Hat, 5T",I bought this shirt for my son to wear at his first birthday! I am doing a cat in the hat theme so this shirt was perfect! I LOVE THE VIBRANT COLOR!!!,5,1
Dr. Brown's Double Electric Breast Pump,"This pump is great for busy moms on-the-go. The nice black carrying case fits all the pieces in perfectly, and you'd never know it was a breast pump from the outside! I'm nursing my fourth child, and wish I had this pump with the first three.  It is so much more comfortable to use than other pumps I had in the past.  The breast cup is much softer than anything I've used before, and the compression/suction feels much more natural. It does take some practice the find the right setting, but I love that there are different options to try.If I had to find something to improve, the noise level seems a little high while it's running.  There are also lots of parts to put together and take apart for cleaning, but once you get the hang of it, it's not a big deal.Overall, this is a great choice for breastfeeding moms who want/need the flexibility that pumping provides. Definitely worth the investment.",5,1
Dr. Brown's Double Electric Breast Pump,"I have to admit, as well, that this is the only pump I have tried.  I really like this pump, I really love the tote bag it comes in(very covert), i like the overall gentleness of the pump especially at the beginning when things were, eh, tender.  I love the ease of the storage bottles and how all the bottle products fit into one another (the (4oz or 8oz) bigger bottles can be used as storage containers too or I can pump right into the bottle.)  I don't think it is crazy loud either.Here are a few things I think could improve.  It is not hands free(most aren't.)  However, I wish they made a bra for the pump.  I ended up buying the Medela bra and it almost fits perfectly but is still not quite right.  The top plastic piece that snaps down over the white piece broke.  It broke where it snaps in the back.  That piece needs to be something other than plastic. However, customer service has been great in the replacement!!!  You do have to double check all the parts to make sure they are together correctly for efficient pumping.  I do use it on the most intense setting... which ended up working the best for me production wise. Another thing that would be cool is if it had a battery option; it has to be plug in.All and all I'd recommend the product to anyone!  I love the pump honestly, very much! And most all the Dr. Brown products!",4,1
Ring Snuggies ~ Ring Sizer / Assorted Sizes Adjuster Set of Six Per Pack,Perfect for what I needed. They come in a variety of lengths and sizes so that I could find the perfect one I needed for my engagement ring.,5,1
Ring Snuggies ~ Ring Sizer / Assorted Sizes Adjuster Set of Six Per Pack,I bought this to size a ring down. It came as it was advertised and worked perfectly. Fast shipping also.,5,1
Ring Snuggies ~ Ring Sizer / Assorted Sizes Adjuster Set of Six Per Pack,"My wedding ring became loose after a year... Weightloss? not sure... but when I slip on the medium size snuggie, they hold my ring on perfectly. No more ring slipping off. I see a lot of negative reviews. Honestly, not sure why. I can't feel the snuggie (though I fiddle around with it a lot...).",5,1
,"We have both the Luv It and the Cube It and think these products are fantastic. They are heavy duty and have cleanly cut through nearly everything we've thrown at it. Not only is it quick and easy to use, but seriously, how FUN!! The name FunBites says it all! The cube size pieces are perfect for kids, and we've used it for fancy fun appetizers for adults too! Yeah!",5,1
,"I LOVE the CubeIt! FunBites!!!! This is perfect, especially for little kids that are starting on finger food, the squares are perfect size. My older kids that are 5 1/2 love it too. We use this at least 5 times a week and the best part, it's dishwasher safe!",5,1
"CoCaLo Crib Bumper, Daniella","This is the bedding my daughter picked out for her baby's room so I purchased it for her.  It is very pretty and goes with the set (as I would expect it to) perfectly; fits the crib as it should and enhances the bed.  I would recommend if you choose the CoCalo, Daniella bedding for your baby.",5,1
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary",Love this little seat. It fits perfectly on my toilets!  Love that its one solid piece so it makes for easy cleaning if a little pee way on it. The deodorizer on the back is an added bonus!,5,1
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary","I got three of these. One for my house and one for each grandparents house. Just set it on the potty, out the kid on, and there you go! A quick shot of Lysol when they are done and you could even put it in the dishwasher (alone) to sterilize it. The odor absorber is pretty pointless. Perfect fit for little bums.",5,1
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary","I got this potty seat when toilet training our now 3 year old and we love it.  It fits our more rounded toilet perfectly and now I'm ordering it for our elongated seat.  According to reviews it won't fit perfectly, but when we've traveled to see family with this it was always very stable, even if it didn't fit perfectly.  My daughter is comfortable with it and actually asked for another one in lieu of our potty seat with an integrated step.  We'll just get a stool or step so she can get up to it.  We've never used the deodorizer disc and I don't think we ever will so don't worry that you'll be replacing those things constantly. Don't waste your time with bells and whistles.  This potty seat is all you'll need.",5,1
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary","So affordable. Do NOT get the cushioned kind. Little ones' urine gets all over the front, splits it, and smells to high heaven.  This one is durable, inexpensive, and has front lip to prevent overspray. Get a wide wrap around step stool to assist your little one getting up & down on their own and perfect.",5,1
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary",I just received this today and although we haven't used it yet I can already tell it's a quality product. The seat fit perfectly on our toilet and does not slide around. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I'm basing the review on preliminary observations. It does appear that this seat will help our boy transition from diaper to toilet.,4,1
"Munchkin Sarabear Portable Diaper Caddy, White Waffle","This is awesome. I have a home daycare and needed a simple way to organize wipes and several different diapers. This is perfect because it has four small cubbies that are perfect for diapers, and one long on in the middle for wipes.",5,1
"Munchkin Sarabear Portable Diaper Caddy, White Waffle","Love this basket as it goes perfectly with our nursery and has a lot of nice storage! Is well made and of good materials...and so cute!I like that the product is made of real wood and is PVC, dye and formaldehyde free and that the stain used on the wood is water based and lead-free.The only thing that was different, is the actual basket (on the one we received anyway) was more of a dark, dark brown (closer to &#34;black&#34;) rather than a deep brown color, as seen in the photo. I imagine this is due to each one being stained (by hand?) rather than it being fake wood and dye. But all in all it is still super adorable and useful! We'd definitely purchase again if we needed to! And it could be used for anything really...not just as a diaper caddy!",5,1
"OXO Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser, Pink","We have a ten-month-old. Since the very first day, we have been looking for a wipe container to replace the cheap one comes with the wipes. The only choices we found are wipe warmers. But I don't want the ""warmer"" part. I just need a functional container to replace the flimsy ones that come with the wipes. This one is just perfect for my needs! It looks great and comes with thoughtful design: it has four tiny rubber pads on the bottom to hold it firm on the changing table. The build quality is top-notch. It has a weight plate to hold the wipes in place when you pull wipes out of it. Did I mention it look great? It also has a window to see how much wipe is left. I still keep wipes in the plastic bag, so the window may not be that useful to me. Also I would like it to be on the other side, too. I place the container right next the changing pad. It blocks the window.  But this is a very minor issue to me. I can live with it. Overall, this is must-have for parents.",5,1
Baby Liberty Soft-Bite Spoons MADE IN USA!,"I don't a lot to discuss with regards to these spoons, as they are just baby spoons. However, I love that they are made in the USA and from material that are free of phthalates, adipates, lead and BPA.  They are the perfect size for my 8month old son, who also likes to chew on the white spoon part.  All in all a great, quality product.",5,1
Pooh Hunting for Hunny High Pile Blanket,"This blanket is perfect for a boy or a girl. It's soft enough that it keeps your baby/toddler cozy and worm through out the year. We take it everywhere we go because it's small, but not to small. We've washed it a couple of time and it stays soft and no colors diminish. Just like the day I got it!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Fastfinder Deluxe Messenger Diaper Bag, Black","love it!! perfect for me or husband to take our baby, the finishings are high quality, size, color compartiments and practicity.....!!!",4,1
Regal Rocker Rocking Stand - Espresso - for Moses Baskets,"This product is a great design, and fit our Moses Basket perfectly.  It was easy to assemble, and even came with the tools needed to do so (nice for a pregnant Mom who didn't want to dig through her ""junk closet"" to find a screwdriver).  It is a beautiful dark wood color, matching most of our modern dark wood furniture.  It is light weight and easy to move around the house (with or without baby).  The range of motion on the rocker isn't that large, but it is probably safer since the Moses Basket sits in it without fasteners. My only two recommendations for improvement would be: 1) offer a taller stand to act as a bedside sleeper for today's taller beds (I have to lean down pretty far to get her out of the basket) and 2) make one of the sides a little higher than the other so that the baby's head can be slightly elevated (reduces baby spit-up). But this was a quality product and beautuful addition to our daughter's nursery.",4,1
"Perfect Bum 6 Piece Trifolds Reusable Liner, White, Large","These inserts are awesome! My daughter is a very heavy wetter and managed to stay totally dry in a Perfect Bum with these inserts for 3 hours! The top layer closest to her skin was very dry, yet still nice and soft. I love this whole diapering system.",5,1
Hazelaid (TM) Child Hazelwood-Gemstone Necklace - 13.5&quot; Turquoise,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter and it fits her perfectly, and she loves it.  I read that too much acid in the body can cause cavities and she's had two cavities already so I'm hoping this will help.  Too soon to tell but she loves wearing it because I wear one and my infant son wears one for acid reflux. So we all match. :-)",5,1
"Itzy Ritzy Snack HappensSnack Mini Reusable Snack Bag, Social Circle Pink, 2-Count","My daughter absolutely loves these bags. They are perfect for carrying her snacks around in and are so adorable. Everywhere we go, we get compliments on them. They are very durable and so far, have yet to fade from several washings. Great product! Would highly recommend.",5,1
"Itzy Ritzy Snack HappensSnack Mini Reusable Snack Bag, Social Circle Pink, 2-Count","Anytime we would go out, I would always wrap a baby spoon in a little plastic bag and throw it in the diaper bag.  Now, I can just use one of these bags instead and help save the environment.  They fit a munchkin spoon perfectly!  I was also really impressed by the quality of these bags.  The lining feels like plastic, yet it is soft, if that makes any sense.  I plan on filling the other one with puffs and keeping it in my purse in case of ""emergencies.""  The only downside is the price.  I bought mine from Amazon for $9 and change.",4,1
"Baby Emporio - Mary Jane Baby &amp; Toddler Girl Tights (0-6 months, Basic Black)","I saw today my granddaughter wearing this tights . They look great, and comfortable . They fit PERFECT ! ...

Pourty Easy to Pour Potty - White,"Love it!!!! I thought it was tiny when I got it, but it wasn't. It's perfect. My daughter kept taking her 4 piece princess potty apart & always flushing the handle, because it made a pretty tune. It was hard to clean & more of a distraction than anything else! This pourty is so easy to clean, so simple to comprehend, & just about a life saver! I will recommend this to everyone!",5,1
LASSIG Green Label Neckline Bag - Black Melange,I have a 2 yo and infant and this diaper bag is absolutely perfect! Its a versatile bag to go many places because of all the pockets and I love the insulated compartment and bottle bag. The best part is I dont have to compromise style. I get so many compliments!,5,1
Nuk Replacement Spouts - 4 Pack Clear,"This spout is great for transitioning away from a traditional bottle nipple and works MUCH better for my baby than the FAST flow nipple, which mostly leaks everywhere and makes a big mess. This spout is easy for the baby to suck on and releases an adequate amount of milk during the drinking process. It doesn't leak and fits PERFECTLY on the NUK bottles with the original rings and caps. A definite WIN!",5,1

"Boogie Snatcher: Infant, Baby Nose Cleaning Tweezers. Cleans Your Infants Nose For Better Sleep!","Works perfectly!  Some reviews said the tips were too close together and that made me nervous, but I think the width is just right!!  They are small enough for my infants little nose and I feel safe using them on her.  If I need to spread the tips apart when she is older then all I have to do is use my finger to open them up further.  I think the design is made perfectly for little noses.

"Philips AVENT 9 Ounce BPA Free Natural Drinking Cup, 1-Pack, Red","My son (11 months) has never cared to drink out of a sippy cup of any kind,seeing them as something to gnaw on instead. He has, however, been able to drink out of a regular cup since approx. 8 months. Of course, that requires constant ""help"" to prevent spilling, which frustrates him and inevitably ends up with a soggy baby despite our best efforts. This cup is perfect for him! At this age, drinking from a cup is exciting and fun. For an older kid you might want to get one of those travel mug type cups since this is sized for a littler kid. It is PERFECT for us, though, and flow rate is not a problem.",5,1
"Philips AVENT 9 Ounce BPA Free Natural Drinking Cup, 1-Pack, Red","These bottles are sturdy and easy to clean.  Perfect transition for our 2 year old.

This fits perfectly on whole foods cart, but not target, but I do not mind it because it fits on most stores shopping cart.My son is almost 9monthsand he loves it.  Especially, he loves resting his arms on the cushions using them to turn his body to look around.  Also, he loves toy hooks to chew on.  I love two different size of pockets to put bottles, snack container, hats, burp cloth and etc.I have tried many other brands cover but this one is by far the best.Extremely happy with the purchase and recommend this product to everyone.",5,1
"Going to Grandmas Gift Set with Suitcase, Rreceiving Blanket and Rattle - in Blue","I had a suitcase that said going to Grandma's and loved it.

She was having a little boy and I wanted to give something special that no one else was giving so this was it. I would get it again for anyone having a baby!",5,1
"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia","It goes everywhere. I've never found a table it doesn't fit including kitchen islands. Everyone comments on it everywhere we go. It is clean and you don't need to put your child in those dirty high chairs at restaurants. It goes on and off in seconds. Perfect so grandparents don't need to buy a high chair to take up space in their homes too. My baby started sitting in it way before she was supposed to. We put theKiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Terrythat we had for her car seat behind her and she was fine. At nine months she still loves it. She hated her high chair and she just sits in this all the time because she can look behind her and she feels like she is sitting at the table like a big girl. It's nice to just wipe the table in front of her. It works really well with theBABYBJORN Soft Bib, Greento catch the food she drops. It isn't the easiest thing to take apart to put in the wash, but it only takes a couple minutes to put it back together. So worth it! The marina is a nice dark green.",5,1
"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia",I bring this everywhere. My daughter is sitting up but so little and those wooden ugh hairs at restaurants are so big. This is cushy and gets her right up to the table. Perfect and so easy to use.,5,1
"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia","Works really well, my little guy likes to sit at the table so this is a perfect traveling highchair to take to friends and restaurants.",4,1
"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia","My son is 5 months old and we struggled to find a chair that he could sit up in, and that we could take to restaurants. This chair is perfect because the front two supports twist easily and move way down; this means, so far, it has fitted every shape and thickness of table! Also, my son cannot sit up on his own yet. The photos don't show this very well, but there are firm elasticated straps which are stitched to the back which loop around and then secure at the front of the chair. These straps really help support him when he's sitting up at the table - just like a big boy! Oh, and the cover for the chair is hidden in a velcro pocket at the base - you just pull it out and it covers the whole chair! Perfect!",5,1
"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia",This chair has been a perfect addition to our small apartment! The fabric is easy to clean and the chairs are super portable. I am so happy that this product exists!,5,1

My little boys loved them, even my baby who is hard to get to smile was grinning while holding it. Beautiful fabrics and perfect for snuggling little ones.",5,1
"Baby Jogger City Elite Single Stroller, Black","I have this stroller and the BOB Revolution. I like this one better than the BOB, but here are the pros and cons of the City Elite.PRO:My baby sits better in the City Elite than the BOB. The BOB is very slouchy. In the City Elite, he sits more upright and more comfortably, and the recline is easier and faster to adjust.The harness in the  City Elite is better. It is more easily adjustable, lays flatter, doesn't get tangled.I love the adjustable handle height on the City Elite, especially since I'm on the shorter side.I love the one hand fold. It really is easy.CON:The  back wheels of the City Elite stick out way farther from the frame of the stroller than the BOB. They stick out 4-5 inches on either side. This is a pain getting through doorways, and makes it so my 4 year old can't walk next to the stroller. The back wheel is always catching him. I don't know why they can't make the wheels in line with the frame. The BOB is easier to maneuver because of this &#34;back wheels&#34; issue. Also, the BOB might ride a tiny bit smoother (but it's splitting hairs a little bit). They are both a pretty smooth ride.I don't jog. I just wanted a stroller that could be used both in a shopping area and on a bumpy sidewalk/trail for walking. I think the CIty Elite will be just fine for this. I really like it and my baby seems very comfortable in it. I just wish those back wheels were more in line with the frame! Then it would be perfect!",4,1
"Baby Jogger City Elite Single Stroller, Black","We recently upgraded to this stroller, and we are extremely happy with it!  It folds nice and compact, it's easy to fold and unfold, and it performs perfectly.  The wheels seem almost oversized for the stroller, but they move very smoothly.  The back folds completely down so your little one can sleep.  Also, we had problems with our son putting his feet on the wheels of our last stroller -- no problems with that here!  We also love the adjustable handle height and the easy brake system (handled up by the handle bar, rather than on the wheels like our last stroller).  We went inexpensive for our first stroller, and I'm now realizing that we should have just spent the money on one like this a long time ago!",5,1
"Summer Infant SwaddlePod 2-Pack, Hungry Caterpillar, Newborn",Perfect Newborn Accessory.I've always had a hell of a time being able to quickly swaddle a newborn without them being able to successfully wiggle out of the blanket.  This takes all the guess work out of it and swaddles an infant in seconds.  The spandex appears to be very comfy and has a soft cotton feel.  They're easy to wash.  What more could you want?  Our daughter instantly calms down when zipped up in one of these.  I just bought a few more.,5,1
Medela Compatible Breast Pump Tubing - Tender Tubes ( 2 Packs in one package) - For Pump in Style Original and Advanced Breast Pump - BPA Free,My wife wanted to replace the tubes on her breast pump and these worked perfectly. No need to spend extra for the part from Medela.,5,1

"Playtex Snack Bowls with Twist N Click, 2-Count","I love love love love love love . . . love these bowls.  They are made out of heavy-duty, BPA-free plastic that, even when I sterilize them or use the in the microwave, I don't feel is leaching all sorts of nasty chemicals into my baby's food.  I have been using them daily for at least a few months and have not yet had a leak problem.  It is a bit of a mission to get the lids on and off (which, honestly, was part of the allure for me) and sometimes it strains my wrists a bit.  If you have any sort of wrist problems, these are not the bowls for you.  However, I love being able to throw a bowl full of puree into my diaper bag and not have to worry with leakage.  These are the best, most economical thing I've been able to find that fits my needs perfectly.",5,1
Playtex Diaper Genie On The Go Dispenser,I love this item. It comes in handy when traveling and my new grandson needs to be changed. I dont liter so this is perfect and keeps us from having to hold our nose. lol,5,1
KidCo Angle Mount Safeway  - Black,"It will take a cool mind to install this gate, but once you do it's wonderful. We have had ours in use for almost 2 years and it still works perfect. Ours is located at the top of the stairs so it gets a ton of use. My 5 year old can open it with little effort. My baby climbs on the bottom rail and it has held up. I'm very happy, worth every penny!",5,1
Kidco Auto Close HearthGate Black Pet Gate,We bought this for safety around our new wood burning stove. It works perfectly and has a nice finished look to it. Tall enough to even keep the big dogs back! And the door swings open nicely but has a latch that the younger kids can't open. Our insurance company was impressed even when they came out to take pics of the stove to insure it.,5,1
Kidco Auto Close HearthGate Black Pet Gate,Bought this unit last month. This is perfect for someone who still wants to use their fireplace or wood-stove with lil kids around!,5,1
Configure/Hearth Gate 24&quot; Gate Extension WHITE,"Perfect. fits great with the original gate and fits our needs. Solid, sturdy and safe. The band is top notch!",5,1
Configure/Hearth Gate 24&quot; Gate Extension BLACK,Excellent. These fit our KidCo hearth gate perfectly. I regret not purchasing two more. We are going all the way around our wood burning stove.,5,1
KidCo Auto Close ConfigureGate - Black,"Pro: Love the magnetic closure, and this gate was perfect for putting across an awkward space between our kitchen/living.  (tip: We used a KidCo Stairway Gate Installation kit on one side because we had a banister there, and that prevented us from putting holes in the wood.)Con: It has a bonus button that you can press on the gate that helps the gate &#34;stay open&#34; - I didn't buy the gate for this feature - but as soon as the gate is nudged with the smallest amount of force it will pop the button out and the gate will swing closed.  We have a couch fairly close to this gate so we just ended up propping the gate open on the back of the couch.",5,1
"Soft Gear My Deluxe Changing Mat, Pink","While I have not use this product yet because I am still pregnant, it is still prefect for me! I hated having to constantly wash the cover of our son's changing pad leaving just the ugly white pad exposed. This will not have to be washed with anything other than a wipe or a soapy wash cloth and will blend perfect with the dresser so it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb.",5,1
"Cocalo 2 Piece Canvas Art, Peek A Boo Monsters",Great material and they matched perfectly with my sons bedroom. The colors were nice and bright. I have had for about a year and they are in great shape. Good buy!,5,1
BRICA goPad Diaper Changer,"As I am preparing to go back to work I realized that with my long 12  hour shifts my husband is going to be hauling our diaper bag around a lot. He isn&#8217;t too thrilled with that idea. I came across this at a garage sale for a few bucks and fell in love! I figured that I could use this in place of my diaper bag most of the time and carry my cute purse again (it feels good to have something that doesn&#8217;t scream &#8220;mom&#8221;). Anyway, this is perfect. Especially since I&#8217;ve recently just started carrying an extra diaper, wipes and change of clothes in the car and not hauling a diaper bag around anyway. I just leave this in the car all the time and restock as necessary. That way for quick trips around or to take my older child to sports events I only have to grab the baby, my phone and keys and I&#8217;m out the door. I breastfeed, so if you need to carry bottles and formula that&#8217;s another story. My husband just carries that stuff in a small separate bag.Whoever designed this kit obviously has kids and really understands how to make something functional. First off, from the outside it looks stylish. The gray color with baby blue accents is cute. I actually almost didn&#8217;t look at it because it looked like a CD case from the outside. The changing pad is a great size and easy to clean. It&#8217;s very helpful that it zips off! The pockets are great for a couple diapers and small package of wipes. I buy wipes in the travel size section of the grocery store for it. That&#8217;s all I put in it. I keep one extra outfit in each of our trunks and don&#8217;t usually need diaper cream, so the pockets are just right. If you want to carry a bunch of stuff, consider using a diaper bag. I&#8217;m a minimalist and try to carry the bare necessities.",5,1
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,Bought this product to corral the bathtub toys and I love the fact that it has a wide mouth and sits right into the holder attached to the tub wall. Its perfect for my tub!,5,1
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,"So far it doesn't seem to mold like non-mesh toy organizers, and my 2 year old enjoys using it to scoop up his toys. He hates it when we do it for him, so this is perfect for him to do it quickly!",5,1
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,"This is a great organizer for the bath toys. Oversized, very durable and sticks to the bathtub. Perfect for scooping up and draining the toys.",5,1
Auto Close Metal Baby Gate BLACK,"Looks good with our iron work. Fit according to the instructions. Once fitted, press and lift to exit. My 1 year old can't, my 4 year old can - perfect.",5,1
Clevamama Splash and Wrap Baby Bath Towel (Cream),Perfect for a slippery baby! Keeps you dry as well. I give this as a gift to all new moms.,5,1
Clevamama Splash and Wrap Baby Bath Towel (Cream),"I think anyone with kids has been through the water-soaked ritual known as bath time. My kids think that the primary goal of bath time is to get me soaking wet, but I have a new weapon in my arsenal - the Clevamama Splash and Wrap Hooded Towel. It snaps around your neck like an apron and provides an instant defense against even the most enthusiastic splashers.When your kiddos are done with bath time, simply lift them to your chest and fold the hooded towel portion over their head. The child is dry and secure, and you don't have to worry about balancing a towel on your chest while lifting a baby out of a tub. You can tell this product was invented by a mom who had ""been there, done that."" Although the towel claims that it can be used with older toddlers, I think it works best with smaller babies (age 1 and under)- if they're too tall, it's pretty much impossible to get them wrapped up with the hood on. It's not perfect, but it's a definite improvement on what I was using before. It's very soft (imagine a terry-cloth robe). A great new resource in the arsenal of mothers everywhere. :-)",4,1
"Evenflo Journey 300 Stroller with Embrace 35 Car Seat, Koi","It was very easy to set up, the color is nice and it's very lightweight. For the price i didnt expect for it to be such good quality. Overall is perfect I love it!",5,1
"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Ella","Purchased this car seat as a spare seat for my husband's Ford Focus. Exchanging our huge Evenflo Triumph seat from my Ford Escape into his Focus is a hassle, so we usually take my car everywhere. The backseat of the Focus isn't exactly roomy, so we were hoping for a smaller, but still very safe, car seat. This Evenflo Tribute seat is perfect for the Focus.My inlaws were sold on the price, so they purchased one to have on hand in case they ever need to transport their grandson anywhere. For the price, everyone should give this seat a chance!!",5,1
"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Ella","My baby is turning 1 this month so we decided to get him a new carseat since he was outgrowing his other one. When we got this he absolutely loved it!  The first thing he did was sit in it and say &#34;bye bye&#34; Its easy to set up, fits in our car perfectly, and has lots of room for him to grow. I also like how it is forward and rear facing so we can use it for a long time. The only thing I can't seem to work is the cupholder.",5,1
"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Ella","I like this car seat; we have another Evenflo but got a second car seat for emergencies.I do have two complaints, if you will, about this particular model, though.  First, it's a tad bit difficult to snap in the bottom buckle that goes between their legs because it has to be clicked in perfectly straight.  Not the best when you're on the go, but isn't too big of a deal.The greater of the two complaints would be that the straps definitely dig into my two year old's neck.  So, we bought some little monkey protector things that velcro on around that part of the strap.  I would recommend these.",4,1
"Evenflo Compact Fold High Chair, Marianna","I bought this when I was living in a tiny apartment in New  because I was looking to save space. This high chair is perfect. It folds up very easily after you detach the tray and it able to be stored away in a closet or under the bed. The fabric is very easy to clean, I just use a wet sponge and all the dried food comes right off. It dries fast too.My only compliant is that it is not really made for small babies. My little one is around 20 lbs at a year old and she looks tiny in this chair. She's also able to move around a lot and sometimes has a hard time reaching for food because of her size in comparison to the chair.",5,1
"Evenflo Portable BabySuite 300, Marianna","This product looks great and is very sturdy. The size is perfect as it sits in my bedroom. It , works well and was very easy to put together.",5,1
"Evenflo Portable BabySuite 300, Marianna",It fits perfectly and the ease of opening and storing is amazing. Amazons delivery was fast and speedy...I would recommend this to anyone considering a play yard or portable bed.,5,1

"Evenflo Embrace 35 Infant Car Seat Base, Black",This is perfectly compatible with my car seat.  I really like that it has a gage that shows you whether or not the car seat is balanced in the right position.,5,1
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange","This is the second stroller I have purchased for my son.  We originally registered for the Chicco travel system stroller which came with the car seat too.  It was nice for when he was an infant and then transitioned into riding without the car seat attached.  Fast forward two years...I wanted to start exercising more with him and I found it difficult to do so with the Chicco stroller because I would be in a groove then I would get stuck on a crack in the sidewalk and he would almost fly out.  I have a few friends with jogging strollers (BOB, etc) but I was not sure if I wanted to spend that much money.  I am not a serious jogger by any means, but the Baby Jogger City Mini GT is perfect for my needs.  I take it with me to my exercise class (with my son) and it is incorporated into the workout.  We have used it at the zoo, theme parks, mall...its great.  Lightweight, easy to fold and unfold.  I have a car, not an SUV and it fits great with room to spare.  I love the sun shade because it folds so far down that only my son's legs from his shins to feet are exposed on a sunny day.  I would recommend the GT since it has rubber tires and a more accessible basket.  The seat reclines all the way down and has a nice mesh  lining when flat so the child can get some air while sleeping.  Once reclined, you can even change your child's diaper.  This has come in handy for us once or twice when you don't want to stand in line in the bathroom!",5,1
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange","I have a lot to say so here are my bullet points:-Rolls great on rough surfaces-Comfortable push for a me at 5'11'', don't have to alter my stride at all, and I can steer one handed-Seems huge when open, and compact when foldedMy child is now 14 months old, and he's my first so going into this I didn't really know that much about strollers.I had always walked a lot. I have dog that I still try to walk at least once a day, plus I spend time at farmer's markets, state fairs and such on a regular basis. I knew that I wanted a stroller that would allow my child to participate in these activities and for both of us to be comfortable. I live in an older neighborhood and the sidewalks are often in poor condition.I debated extensively last fall about purchasing the City Mini or the City Elite. Both seemed to have great canopies, the ability to steer with one hand, and superb folding mechanism. The Mini looked perfect for the mall and for tossing in the car and the Elite looked perfect for rough sidewalks and parks. I  was concerned that the Mini would not be better than a typical umbrella stroller on rough surfaces and that the Elite was too big and bulky for everyday use. I couldn't decide.This spring the GT was released and it seemed the the perfect combination of the features I wanted. I have to say I love it!. My little one seems so comfortable in the seat and he has plenty of room to grow. The fold option works great, the hand brake instead of foot brake is terrific. We haven't had to use the huge canopy yet, but it will be handy. The recline seems great, I don't think we will use it a ton, but when he falls asleep it will be perfect. I have owned the stroller for about 10 days and have used it at least 8 times already. Since it is still only March in Iowa I anticipate getting years of use out of this stroller.My only suggestion would be that it would be great if the parent console was included.",5,1
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange",Great a stroller! I did a ton of research and decided on the City Mini GT. It has met every expectation. This is the perfect all around stroller. I highly recommend it.,5,1
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange","If you're not looking for a small stroller, this is a great option. Perfect for the city with all the holes and steps and you can really close it easily...",5,1
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange","I have a 9 month old and was looking for a study stroller for outdoors as well as something I could use everyday.  I also wanted something I would be able to use for the next few years.  I was torn between the Britax B-Agile, City Elite, and City Mini GT.  Once I read the reviews for the GT and how it was a nice mesh between the City Mini and the City Elite, I decided to give it a go.  Well I am so glad I did because it is perfect!  We used it when we went to the zoo and it was awesome.  Our son was able to take a few snoozes in it and was such a smooth ride.  I would highly recommend this stroller to anyone looking for an outdoor/indoor stroller.",5,1
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange",I want to say that I love this stroller. There are many things that I consider perfect about it.Quick and easy to collapse.One handed pushYou can often push the stroller with just one hand.,5,1
"Baby Jogger 2012 City Mini Single Stroller, Green/Gray","This is our second City Mini. My daughter has one and we (Nana &Pap) have this one. It is an amazing stroller! So easy to move around in crowds, perfect for walking, shopping or in all situations. Easy to store in the trunk, pops open with one hand and closes just as easily! I have received many compliments on this stroller and have highly recommended it to all!",5,1
"Baby Jogger 2012 City Mini Single Stroller, Green/Gray","As above this pram fitted our purposes beautifully, we do have the bugaboo chameleon but purchased this as compact and easy to fold and fits that perfect.",5,1
SheetWorld Extra Deep Fitted Portable / Mini Crib Sheet - White Quilted - Made In USA,This fit our Mini Crib Mattress perfectly (Crescent 50 Coil) nice and snug but not to tight!  It added a nice layer of cushioning.  It washes beautiful and I would most definitely buy it again.,5,1
"Evenflo Amp Performance No Back Booster Car Seat, Green","We bought this for our 7 year old daughter. She's tall but if she's not in a booster, the seat belt sits uncomfortably on her neck. Our car doesn't have the seat belt holder things so this works perfect for her. Plus the DOT recommends they be in seats for a while yet. She was so excited when it got here. She loves the color and the cup holders are great! Her last booster didn't have a cup holder and the back seat only has 1, so with 3 kids, she'd always have to hold her drink and now she doesn't! All 3 of our kids have Evenflo seats. We won't buy anything else. Our 6 year old son has a green one of these and our 4 year old daughter has the chase booster that has the harness and then you can remove that and use the regular seat belt. I feel confident when I put my kids in the car in an Evenflo seat!",5,1
"Quinny Moodd Stroller, Black Devotion",White frame is good!!!I like this stroller.Maxicosi car seat fits perfectly without any additional accessories.One thing I dislike is changing angle is not free enough.,4,1
Osocozy Better Fit Prefolds - 6 Pack (Premium 4x8x4),"These prefolds have a nice thickness and the quality of the fabric is wonderful. When they arrived they were the perfect size, but with several washings they have shrunk (as most cotton clothing does) to just under the size I needed. Once it goes through several washes to get the natural oils out, they are very absorbent. Very happy with everything about these, although next time I'll remember the tendency to shrink a bit.",4,1
Colorful ABC Animals Soft 100% Cotton Children's Book,This book is so perfect for new little hands that are beginning to explore the world around them. I will be spending lots of time reading this with my little grandson.,5,1
"Skip Hop Wall Decals, Treetop Friends","These are amazing. They are perfect sized letters for putting on a wall to decorate baby's room. They are adorable and easy to use. If you stick it in the wrong place incorrectly, easy to remove and replace how you want it.",5,1
Lock&amp;Lock Hello Bebe Storytelling Educational Design Baby Feeding Stainless Soup Mug with Double Handles,"We have gone through our share of stainless steel feeding products.  For my 20 month old, this one is perfect.Pros:1. Every part that touches food is stainless steel2. Outside is plastic and so food is insulated (she has an all stainless steel bowl that feels warm to the touch and so she sometimes refuses to eat even though the food is fine temperature wise)3. Super cute, she's always pointing out the little characters4. Easy to clean and has held up beautifully to millions of washes (don't have to bother taking things apart like some other products we have and none of the pictures have rubbed off like the &#34;think&#34; products do)5. Feels sturdy and hasn't suffered any dings or scratches even though it has been dropped a number of times6. It has handles so that she can hold the bowl with one hand while scooping/pushing food with her spoon with the other hand (no need to suction the bowl or plate to the table as we did before).7. Perfect size for us (holds around 8, maybe 10 ounces). Not too deep that she can't get her spoon to the bottom to get broth or the last bits of something, and with those handles it is easy to pick up and drink broth.  That said, we use it for everything, not just soupCons1. It can take food a while to cool while in the bowl.  With the stainless steel bowls that come out of their plastic shells you can quickly cool food in a water bath and then put it into the plastic2. Would be great if it came with a water tight lid so that we could take this on the go.  For now I am putting hot foods into a thermos and then pouring it into the bowl when we are out.",5,1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Much better than the Homedics SS-3000 (I've bought 3 homedics and the three broke the engine in less than a year). This of Munchkin already has two years of daily use, and is working perfectly.It has very useful features, such as voice sensor and night light. I think an essential item for babies.",5,1
"Munchkin Travel Bottle Warmer, Gray",This warmer is very handy to have in the car. We use it when travelling or when we are just out shopping for a few hours. The temperature is perfect every time. And the baby agrees. lol,5,1
"Munchkin Wide Spaces Expanding Gate, Light Wood",This gate fits perfectly in the opening to our kitchen. I needed something to keep my son from getting in there and eating the dog food. It was really easy to install and it's easy to open and close. It's much better than trying to step over ordinary baby gates.,5,1
"Munchkin 2 Piece SpongeBob SquarePants Insulated Sippy Cup, Colors May Vary, 9 Ounce",My grandson and son love sponge bob so this was perfect for our 1 year old grandson. Put a big smile on both of their faces.,5,1
"Munchkin Scoop Drain and Store Bath Toy Organizer, Blue",Perfect place to store the bath toys so that my bath tub is not an obstacle course in the morning when I am trying to get ready for work.,5,1
"Munchkin Time Saver Bottle Warmer, White","This is the second one we've purchased and we love it. I'm not sure where the bad reviews are coming from.First, the water reservoir is see through, so you can in fact see when the water is running out. We fill it maybe twice a day for roughly 6-8 bottles per day. Bad reviewers have a serious case of First World Problems if filling a reservoir twice a day is too much work. When the reservoir runs out and it's heating nothing, it makes a pretty apparent hissing sound that you can hear clearly.Second, it does warm bottles larger than 4oz (saw a bad review), you just have to set the timer for longer. We use 6oz and 8oz bottles of organic whole milk. 6oz warms perfectly in 5 minutes and the 8oz in 6 minutes. Just enough time for you to set it and go change the diaper!The only con I can think of is this thing gets pretty nasty, but this may be due to the horrible tap water we have in our city. It's nothing we haven't been able to scrub off with dish soap and water though.",5,1
BambinOz Anywhere Chair Travel High Chair,I've only used this 1 weekend but it is perfect for my 11 month old.  It turns any chair into a high chair which is great for restaurants but also in people's homes who don't have a high chair.  You can buckle it in less than a minute.  The best part is it rolls up into a very small drawstring bag.  I'm looking forward to taking it abroad where they might not have high chairs everywhere we go.,5,1
Babies R Us 8-Pack Washcloth Set (Pink),These washcloths are pretty thin so they are perfect for washing/bathing a small baby.  I also use these to clean my baby's hands and face after meal time.,5,1
"Boppy Travel Pillow, Mama Dot/Basket Green","Life saver.  Compact.  Perfect for plane travel and allowing my son to sit on my lap.  We flew to hawaiinwhen he was 11 weeks old and then a bunch of commuter flights (small aircraft) and it was perfect! Only thing in wish was different is that one side is slightly bigger than the other so while breast feeding on the right side, unfelt like he was a little lower than the right.",5,1
Blooming Bath Baby Bath - Hot Pink,"I found this bath did not work well with my very deep and generous kitchen sink. However it did work perfect with my slightly larger than normal bathroom sink. Just keep in mind the types of sinks you have available in your house to try this in, it will probably fit in one or another, you just might have to be flexible where bath time takes place!It's a definite buy to try, although it may not work for everyone, for those it does work for, its a great item! My baby loves bath time now (probably because I'm not stressed out anymore about dropping his slippery little body into the sink!) and will lounge in this bath as long as I let him! :)Plus it looks adorable for photos and can be used later on as a fun bath toy for toddlers :)One downfall (which is why I docked one star) the inner circle sticking that attaches the petals to the center is not the greatest. I found that it was not a consistently thick seam all the way around and can forsee having to possible repair it/reinforce it in the future. This isn't a huge concern for me because I'm pretty handy with a needle but its just something to check for when it arrives!",4,1
"Kate Aspen Set of 24 Born To Be Wild Favor Box, Jungle Themed",These are so cute and perfect for a little jungle theme. Definitely came at a great price and everyone loved them at the shower! Thought they were adorable and would use them again if I could :),5,1
"KidCo Safeway Safety Gate, White",I bought 2 of these for top and bottom stairs and works really great. It is very sturdy that even if my toddler shakes them it will not move. The lock is perfect too I don't think my toddler could ever figure out how to open it. The only minor problem I have is that I have a 5 years old and she as well struggle to open the latch. Other than that I have no complain.,5,1
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free Glass Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology and Bonus Silicone Sleeve, 3-Pack","Perfect for my needs. I store breastmilk and bring the 4 bottles to daycare. All the teacher needs to do is to unscrew the top with nipple, remove the sealing cover, screw back the top with nipple. It's minimal handling and the milk is transported in an airtight condition.I sterilize them daily and the teachers heat them up in an electric warmer. The bottles are still holding up well.I wrote to the manufacturer and confirmed that the silicone sleeves need not be removed during warming up in the electric warmer.I highly recommend Bornfree glass bottles.The only flaw is that they do not fit my hygiea pump flanges. So I have to express into wide neck bottles and then pour my milk into Bornfree glass bottles. It's a bit of hassle. I also didn't receive a reply from the manufacturer on whether the adaptor fits the hygiea's flanges.",5,1
Summer Infant 28034/28035 Best View Extra Adaptor,The adaptor on my Summer Video monitor went out. I went to a BIG name baby store and bought a new monitor. On a whim I checked out amazon to see reviews and saw that I could order JUST the adaptor for my perfectly good monitor. I took the new monitor back to the store and thanks to next day delivery had my Summer Monitor back up and running. I saved over $150.00!! YAY!!,5,1
"HALO SleepSack 5-Piece Bumper-Free Crib Set, Caterpillar","Overall, I love the idea of the HALO Safe Sleep Crib Sets. They come with everything I need to keep my babies out of harm's way. This gives me peace of mind as a parent, and allows me to get a good night's sleep rather than rush to make sure they're breathing every 10 minutes or so. (Yes, I am neurotic that way...Or I was, when my babies were a bit smaller.)I also love that these sets are so well made. The quality of construction is top-notch, and the colors and prints are wonderful and would fit into any nursery decor. (What else would you expect from HALO though?) My daughter, Sophie, absolutely loves the funky prints as well as the pink elephant and the flowers featured on this set. Yep, this is totally her style, and she made sure she gave it her seal of approval.The only thing that was the slightest bit disappointing was that the included Sleep Sack Wearable Blanket was far too small for my daughter to enjoy. She cried and cried and threw a downright tantrum when she couldn't get into her ""blankie"". However, most parents who are shopping for crib bedding are shopping for newborns and smaller babies, so this would fit their needs perfectly. Luckily, HALO also makes a Big Kid version of their amazing Sleep Sacks, and I have a sneaking suspicion I will be purchasing them soon for Sophie and Xander.I would definitely recommend the HALO Safe Sleep Crib Set to any parent looking for the perfect crib bedding for their little bundle of joy. This is a much safer alternative to traditional crib bedding, and your babies will be snug as a bug in a rug as they settle in for a good night's sleep.",5,1
"HALO SleepSack 5-Piece Bumper-Free Crib Set, Caterpillar",I am very happy with this product. I washed everything and it is all in perfect condition. Can't wait to put to use!,5,1
"Lansinoh mOmma Straw Cup, Orange","I really love this cup. It's easy to clean, cute, and the flow of the straw isn't too fast. I have had no spills or leaks. The straw needs to be a tiny bit shorter so that my son can drink all of his smoothie but other than that it's perfect.",4,1
"Munchkin Click Lock 2 Count Sippy Cup, 9 ounce",We love the Munchkin click lock sippy cups at our house! I don't have to worry about them leaking all over and you get the added satisfaction of hearing that with a &#34;click!&#34; The size is perfect for my older toddler and he loves the fun color combinations of these cups! The best part is Munchkin guarantees that the cups are leak proof! I would definately recommend these. They are a great product and value!,5,1
Skeleton Bone Baby Socks White And Black Punk Rockabilly Unisex Infant,"My son was a skeleton for Halloween & his glow in the dark onesie didn't include the footie part. The sizing was worded a bit awkward on the amazon listing, but they were a perfect fit for my 4 month old! He still wears them, the skeleton part has not faded or cracked like many other design socks. I like them & recommend them.",5,1
"RECARO Euro Convertible Seat, Bella","I have a Subaru Forester with 2 car seats in it, one forward facing and one rear upon initial installation.  When I installed the Recaro Euro rear facing I had to use a small diameter foam noodle to make it level, but that is easy enough.  It does take some effort to install, but what quality car seat doesn't.  I could not have a tall person in the passenger seat, but I couldn't with any rear facing seat I have ever had, infant or convertible.  Now we are forward facing and loving it all the same.  My Recaro does not wiggle a millimeter, but does take me getting into the car seat with my knee to put sufficient pressure to tighten the straps so I can have no movement, but I do this with all car seats I install.  I used a properly adjusted and installed rear facing baby mirror on the head rest and now use a small mirror that clips onto my sun visor and could see my baby girl perfectly each time.  All of these items take proper adjustment and time to install.  Having a second person adjust the mirrors while you sit in the driver's seat directing them, but all else is typical installation but super stronger than any I have had before.",5,1
Imperial 4 Tier Plastic Cupcake / Dessert Stand - Up to 24 Cupcake Holder Stand White,"El stand de cupcake es excelente para la exposicion de pasteles y cupcakes, son perfectas, sencilla de usar y facil de lavar. 100% recomendado!",5,1
"3 Sprouts Storage Caddy, Mouse",She loves owls and this little tote was a perfect storage tote to keep all of her friendship loom stuff in one location and then transport btwn her mom and da's house :) Thanks-- LOVE 3 SPROUTS--- Keep making storage cute and functional-- I will keep buying it!!,5,1
"3 Sprouts Storage Caddy, Mouse","If this stood on its own, it would be perfect. It doesn't - it's more like using a purse or a tote bag, the bottom is completely soft so it flops over if it's not against something (or perfectly weighted inside with your stuff).I used this when I was pregnant with twins to carry all my stuff from room to room because I wasn't very mobile and couldn't get up and down easily. IT WAS AWESOME and I'd use it again for that, in fact I will use it when I'm nursing for the same thing - to keep stuff I might need nearby when I can't get up and down easily.I used the little side pockets for my iphone, chapstick, hair ties, pens and pencils, etc., and in the big main pocket I could fit tons of stuff - face wipes, ipad mini, kindle, cough drops, kleenex, lotion, vitamins, granola bars, a book, my water bottle, etc. Very easy to carry around with me from room to room. I used it a lot at night, too - I went back and forth from the bed to the couch a lot, and having this made it easier so I wasn't fumbling around in the dark waking people up when I switched rooms. I just grabbed this.So, kind of an unusual use, but if you're pregnant or nursing, or just had surgery or something and can't get up and down a lot, I'd recommend this as a way to keep whatever you need right next to you. It'd also be a nice gift for someone in that situation - you could fill it with the little things they might need if they can't get up easily.",4,1
"3 Sprouts Storage Caddy, Mouse",it is a perfect size! makes a nice lunch caddy for kids to get their own snacks in and out!,5,1
"3 Sprouts Storage Box, Dog",very sturdy!  it fits the ikea expedite perfectly!  great for toy or hallway organization.  it hasn't once gotten a smudge from heavy use.  we've had it for a few months now.,5,1
"3 Sprouts Storage Bin, Monkey","I have no idea why or if anyone else has this problem but our cats love peeing on this storage bin which we use as laundry bag in the nursery. This will be my 5th bag I have gotten. I love the designs, they are so cute and perfect for a nursery. However, you can only spot clean these bags so when our cats pee on them it's nearly impossible to spot clean them plus when I had tried to spot clean you could see a difference in the fabric.",4,1
"Summer Infant Swaddle Me Luxe Velboa, Boy","This is the softest, sweetest swaddle me for a baby boy I have seen! It is perfect- the color is exactly what is pictured and there are little cars that are shaded so they blend into the material but stand out enough to be noticed. The nicest thing about the Summer Infant brand is the quality is so good you can use and use, reuse and pass on the wrap and it still looks brand new and holds up well. I will not use any other brand and definately recommend this if you want your baby boy wrapped in complete comfort or you just want to hold a soft little bundle in your arms all day!",5,1
"Lansinoh mOmma Nipples, Slow-Flow, 2 Count","After a roller coaster of feeding issues, I am so relieved that my daughter is able and willing to accept a bottle with these nipples. She is exclusively breastfed and doesn't get confused by these nipples, nor has a preference for them over the breast either. I don't recommend the mOmma bottle just because it doesn't fit in a bottle warmer. So, using these nipples with Phillips Avent classic bottles works PERFECTLY with the Kiinde Kozii bottle warmer, and everyone is happy!",5,1
"Lansinoh mOmma Nipples, Slow-Flow, 2 Count","After seeing so many positive reviews on the mOmma bottle, we tried it which uses this nipple.  My baby kept collapsing the nipple and the bottle leaked.  My breastfed baby and I were frustrated and I was suppose to return to work soon.  After frantically trying many different bottle and nipple combinations (Dr. Brown's Wide Neck, Playtex Drop-Ins, First Years Breastflow, Avent, Tommy Tippee, mOmma, Comotomo (great when she was first born), and Gerber First Essential, we finally had the best combo for our baby with minimal leakage. The mOmma nipple with Dr. Brown's wide neck bottle.  She liked the soft texture and tapered shape of this nipple and the venting from the Dr. Brown's wide neck bottle prevented the nipple from collapsing.  And since the Dr. Brown's bottle comes with a bottle disc, I don't have to worry leaks while on the go. Perfect.",4,1
4 Pack Podee Hands Free Baby Bottle Feeding System,The Podee is a great product. Both of my kids had used it. It's perfect for baby's that doesn't like to lay to drink. It helps them transit really quickly to sipping a straw. My Son is now almost 1 and he can now sip on a straw. One thing I didn't like about the Podee is that it tends to leak.,4,1
Dream On Me 3&quot; Inner Spring Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress,"This mattress is very nice and great quality , fits the pack and play perfect .I love the value, love it.",5,1
Dream On Me 3&quot; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress,"Fits perfectly in our Graco Pack n Play. We use it when traveling, only way to get the little man to sleep away from home.  We didn't have the strong odor that others had. Maybe a little expensive, but if it helps him sleep, I'll pay it!",5,1
Dream On Me 3&quot; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress,This mattress fits perfectly. I'm glad we found something to make the pack and play more comfortable for sleeping. I would recommend this if your baby sleeps in the pack and play often.,5,1

Dream On Me 3&quot; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress,"I love this mattress give my baby the perfect comfort, fits perfectly the pack and play and its not heavy so it makes even easierI recommend this product",5,1
Dream On Me 3&quot; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress,"Bought this for my graco pack and play play yard. Wanted a mattress to put into the play pen, as the play pen came with a padded board, but i find it a little too hard to put my baby (5 months then) in it without a mattress.This mattress is neither too hard nor too soft. My baby would sleep in it while we travel. It fits perfectly into my graco pack and play play pen. And for those looking for a sheet, i bought the ""Carters Easy Fit Jersey Portable Crib Fitted Sheet"" for it and it fits very well on it. Hope this review helps!The link for the crib sheet:B001CWF01O",5,1
Dream On Me 3&quot; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress,"Just got this today, but it appears to be a quality mattress.  It fits my Graco Pack-n-play perfect.  I ordered an American Baby Portable Crib sheet for it too.  These sheets don't say they will fit this mattress, but apparently others have bought them together before.  The sheet does fit the mattress, but just barely, and it's pretty thin.  Anyway, it works in a pinch if you need a sheet right away for the mattress.",5,1
Dream On Me 3&quot; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress,"I started researching PNP Mattresses after my sons's two month check up and he was already 11 lbs. I read so many reviews and was hesitant to make ANY purchase!Everyone kept commenting that the mattress was too hard and not comfortable, but I had to get something. I finally chose the Dream on Me 3&#34; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress and I couldn't be happier.It is NOT hard at all. It is has the right amount of give, but is solid enough to not worry about him at night. It also fit perfectly in the Graco Pasadena Pack N Play Link Here (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Y9AKZI/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1)I have an organic fitted sheet on it that also fits great.It doesn't have the plastic/fake feeling that other baby/toddler mattresses have either. I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone that is using a PNP as a crib.",4,1
Dream On Me 3&quot; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress,"Great mattress! Fits perfectly into Graco-on-the-Go. It's a little bit on the thin side, but still works great. If your kid sleeps in this GOG crib quite often I would recommend to get 2 of them, a bit pricey but surely worth it!",5,1
Dream On Me 3&quot; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress,It is just the right firmness without being too hard.  My daughter loves it and it fit the Da Vinci crib perfectly!  I only wish they made a mini version for the mini crib we bought in addition to the full size one.,5,1
NUK Cook-n-Blend Baby Food Maker,"After hours of research regarding which baby food maker to purchase I decided on this model as a blog suggested it.  So far this item has worked wonderful.  I love that it does what the other much more expensive one's accomplish.  I've read over and over about other products and the mold issues.  Even if this was an issue with this model in the future I would still count this as a great investment as it costs half as much as the competitors.  So far everything I've made in this has turned out perfect and my baby prefers this home made food to the jar food hands down.  Plus it takes next to no time in a day from start to finish to have perfect baby food.  Only wish I had tried this out on my first baby.Update as of September 1st 2013. The product stopped working, literally the day after it the return window closed for Amazon. Now I have to contact the manufacturer as there is a one year warranty. What a hassle though. I have loved this baby food maker and then today it just stopped steaming. Everytime I would push the button to steam it would shut off within one or two minutes and wouldn't let me restart it. I really loved this so I hope they can replace it at no cost.",5,1
NUK Mash &amp; Serve Bowl,"This thing is so awesome.  I just got it for my third child, and I wish I had had it for the other two!  The holes in the &#34;masher&#34; make it so easy to really puree the food and get it just the right consistency.  I used it for bananas so far, and it is easier than the mini food processor I used to use.  I was able to get half of a banana perfectly pureed in just a few seconds!  No lumps at all.  I can't wait to use it for other things!",5,1
NUK Mash &amp; Serve Bowl,"My husband and I make our daughter's baby food so when I found this, I thought it would be perfect for softer fruits like bananas and peaches. It works great and washes easily in the dishwasher.",5,1
"Maclaren Quest Sport Stroller, Black/Champagne","After my lightweight (11 lbs) Cybex gave in to NYC Streets and beatings from gateside plane checks, we needed a new umbrella stroller.I narrowed my search down to the MacClaran Quest, UppaBaby G-Luxe and Bumbleride Flite.Very happy with the Quest.  Easy fold & unfold, loads of room for my 2 year old, one hand recline is awesome.  Although not the lightest (13.1 vs. the 9.0 Volo), I LOVE the full recline - worth the extra few pounds to me.  My husband also thinks it is east to use.I live in NYC and have little space and time to fold/unfold/store and get my daughter in/out with bags/briefcase/groceries in hand.  Even if you live in suburbia, I think this is a perfect combo of larger strollers and umbrella strollers.More info for the detail-oriented readers:--Sturdier than UppaBaby G-Luxe.--G-Luxe harder to fold and has two hand, string recline.  Bulky seat padding makes it cumbersome.--Easiest umbrella stroller to navigate one-handed.  Not as easy as my large Teutonia, but better than other brands in its class.--Some people think the Quest five-point harness is too hard to undo.  For my crafty toddler, I rest assured she cannot undo the buckle.  Sure, it's an extra 3-5 seconds to undo it, but worth the peace of mind for me.--I could not find a retailer in a 75 mile radius who carried the Bumbleride Flite and went on YouTube to find demo videos.  Although it is sleek and has a few features more than the Quest (larger canopy and easier buckle), it still did not seem as user friendly as the Quest.--Downside of Quest is the canopy.  Even open, it is not large and does not shift down/adjust like my Cybex.  Personally, I was willing to concede on this for the full recline.  I can use a muslin receiving blanket or add-on canopy for sunny days.--The Quest wheels cannot lock when in fold position, so storing against a wall is hard (not an issue if you have more space), but I do not mind this for the features it affords my daughter.Happy stroller hunting!",5,1
"green sprouts Cool Calm Press, Turtle","Cute little owl, about the size of a beverage coaster. Perfect for first-degree kitchen burns and even to avoid a second degree burn if you apply it quickly enough. Nice and flexible even when fully frozen. Refreezes quickly.",5,1
"Disney Prelude Play Yard, Sweet Silhouettes","It's comfortable for the baby, its at the perfect height to change diapers, etc. I think it is a great product.",5,1
"Cosco Juvenile Funsport Play Yard, Kontiki",This was perfect for what I needed it for. Great to have on hand when friends with little ones visit. Was worth every penny.,4,1
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black","I bought this for my daughter and her kiddo. It clings to the window well, no suction cups! She has long windows and it's hard to find window shades that work well. These are perfect for her car windows in the back and keep the sun off her daughter's face. Good product!",4,1
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black",Easy to stick to glass. Perfect. I have been searching for an item like this for a long time. I am glad it doesn't require suctions,5,1
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black","Perfect fit for Volvo XC-90! I have tinted glasses, but needed a little extra protection from sun light and this product delivers just that. It also add some security. People will not be able to view whats inside the car thru the glass. Just as expected. Well made product. They have not come of since the day I install them 1 year ago. I most certainly recommend, buy with confidence. You will not be disappointed.",5,1
"Britax Head and Body Support Pillow, Iron/Gray",I purchased this product for my double BOB. I was concerned about my newborn not having any head support. I have been using this for 3 months and love it! It holds him right in place and he fits great in it. It looked big when I took it out of the box but after I got it and my baby in the stroller it's perfect. The stroller straps fit right through the opening between the head and arm support so the straps are where they should be. The material is great and has held up over a few washes. I love that it's reversible now that it's summer. Would definitely recommend for stroller use.,5,1
"Britax Kick Mats (2-Pack, Black)",It is perfect size for my rav4 2010 and also good price. But can't put too much things into the pocket,5,1
"Britax Kick Mats (2-Pack, Black)","These definitely save the back of my seats from muddy footprints. They are a little hard to get on and off and I am afraid the elastic might wear if I take them on and off too much. I really like the pockets, they hold headphones, cars, sunglasses, etc perfectly. The black matches my car seats. It is nice it comes in a two pack too!",4,1
"Britax Kick Mats (2-Pack, Black)",These arrived less than 2 days later. They work perfectly. My 3 year old loves to put her feet up on the back of the seat and we were so tired or arguing with her to stop getting our seat dirty - this worked perfect. Fits great (2011 ford edge) and serves it purpose.,5,1
"Britax Kick Mats (2-Pack, Black)",We had a set of these for my first and he kicks and kicks and beats on them. This is our second set for a new addition. They are great and prevent your seats from becoming black from kids shoes. The pockets at the top are a nice bonus even though they don't hold too much.  I have a midsize SUV and it fits my seats perfectly.,5,1
Red Polka Dot Satin Diaper Cover juDanzy Bloomer 0-6 Months,Bought this item for photo shoots and it couldn't be more perfect. Super cute and classy. Fits perfect for the little ones and seems to be holding strong. Definitely a must buy if looking!,5,1
Hape Early Melodies Little Drummer Wood Toy,Great sounds. Perfect size. My little guy loves to bang on it even more than the box it came in!,5,1
"Vulli So'Pure Teether Duet, Sophie the Giraffe","Love these. Perfect for teething, small enough to throw in a diaper bag, love that there are two in a pack.",5,1
"Carter's Rug, Baby Bear",This looks so cute in baby's nursery. The browns are very soft and match the carpeting perfectly. It ties in my dark walnut crib color.,5,1
"Baby Aspen Croc in Socks Plush Toy and Baby Socks Gift Set, Green","This product arrived perfect, exactly like I expected. This was the best baby shower gift that made everyone just go crazy over it! I bought both pink and green and will always bring one of these to every baby shower going forward. This is a must have!!!!",5,1
"Karibu Baby Folding Bath, Blue/White","My in laws don't have a tub. My 18 month old is tall and this is perfectly sized. There are places for small tub toys, soap and wash cloth. Open all the way for safety. It collapses to a small size perfect for hanging on a wall or in a closet or under a bed.",5,1
"Karibu Baby Folding Bath, Blue/White","As we only have a stall shower in our upstairs bath, and no tub, we needed a tub to bathe my son, preferably one that was easy to store.  This definitely fit the bill.  We had been using a small newborn-toddler tub, which worked very well when we was little, but was way too small and confining once he hit about 6 months (and could easily reach over the side/try to climb out). The Karibu tub is great for our purposes - perfect size for an older baby (and my son is long for his age) and seems like it should be fit him for a while longer, nice and deep but still easy to hold on to him due to the wider top and narrower bottom, seems very sturdy when fully opened, drain plug opens/closes easily.  And the best part - folds up very narrow, and is easy to store under our bathroom vanity.  The only con is that the water temp detector in the drain plug seems totally inaccurate.  We use a separate thermometer instead.Note - I began using this when my son was 7 months old, so this review is only for older babies and when used in the fully open position - I have no idea how well this would work for a newborn.",5,1
"Sound Beginnings Pregnancy Music Belly Band, Black, Large","For about three months I went back & forth on this item: trying to decide if it was really worth the cost.  Finally, as a treat to myself after two long weeks, I ordered it.  Boy, am I glad that I did!  I'm not sure what about the ""new"" model is different from the old one, but I'm a huge fan of this product.  The band, itself, is made of durable, super comfortably soft, stretchy fabric that has become my favorite thing to wear.  Yes, the pocket will stick out from under your tight shirt if you have the splitter and/or your mp3 player tucked in.  But, even when I'm not utilizing the speaker system, I wear this thing.  For whatever reason, I prefer having something loosely compressing my belly; and this band totally does the trick.  As for its intended, sound-delivering purpose: as far as I can tell, it's great.  Yes, the splitter isn't the greatest one you could buy, but it works perfectly fine for me & Baby to share whatever it is I'm listening to.  And, since my husband deployed with the military, this has been a vital lifeline through which Baby can hear Daddy's voice.  Now whenever we have a chance to Skype, I pull the Sound Beginnings band on and the whole family is involved in the conversation!  As I said, the cost is more than I would want to have to spend.  But I will tell you that it has been worth the money for me: both for its comfort (I've slept in it because I like it so much & I'm wearing it now as I type) and for its job in sharing the live & recorded voices of loved ones near & far- plus music and whatever else.  I am so pleased that I bought this item!  I imagine you will be, too.",5,1
BRICA Roll 'n Go Car Seat Transporter,"I have had no major issues with this product. I have used this product 4 times in a year with a cosco scenera car seat and it has been perfect.I wanted something that did not attach to the luggage. The only thing is, it does not work for the infant carriers and sometimes going through security at the checkpoint you have to take it apart, which is a pain if your by yourself and have your hands full, however, its pretty easy to put back on.I don't know what the other reviewers were talking about on that it was flimsy and broke easily. I am not very good with my stuff and neither are the airport staff who tuck it away underneath the plane. (I usually keep it still attached to the car seat so it doesn't get lost) and never had any issues.I also love the wheels on this they easily move in a circle and you have a very good turning radius with this, making it easier to maneuver in a elevator. You can also pull in front of you or behind you. Worth the money in my opinion.",4,1
Blue Baby Bottle Containers (3 dozen) - Bulk,I was looking for favors for a baby shower and these worked out perfectly.  I filled them with Hershey's Kisses.,5,1

"Summer Infant Character Change Pad Cover, Butterfly Ladybug",Bought this for my grandson's changing pad. We love the colors and feel of the cover.  It's very nice and fit perfectly.,5,1
"Summer Infant Character Change Pad Cover, Butterfly Ladybug",I was surprised when I received this diaper change pad cover because it has a &#34;furry&#34; like texture but it's very cute and will match the nursery theme perfectly. Great price and a great buy.,5,1
Carter's Bumble Collection Velour Changing Pad Cover,this fit perfect on the pad we ordered! It is soft and snuggley! You will love it our baby does!,5,1
"Bright Starts Entertain and Grow Saucer, Pink",Perfect!!! My baby loves this so much!!! She is thoroughly entertained in it everyday! She's a shorty so we had to put books underneath- but she loves it!,5,1
"Taggies Cozy Cart Cover, Neutral","After what seemed like hours of reading the reviews for the numerous shopping cart covers (who knew there could be so many to choose from), I settled on this one.  I am extremely happy with my decision.  It covers the cart well and it is very easy to put on...no need to read the instructions.  The cover can be attached to the shopping cart with the cart seatbelt while baby has his own comfortable strap built into the cover securing him in place.  It is very safe.  The Taggies are genius.  They are perfectly placed.  My baby loves them by themselves, but I also attach his toys to them using links so that they do not wind up on the dirty floor.  Very comfortable for baby and well constructed, but not bulky.  Cute as can be too.  I am very happy with my purchase.",5,1
"babyletto Madison Swivel Glider, Mocha",I ordered this chair for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!!  It was in perfect condition when it arrived!  Fits in perfectly in the nursery!,5,1
"babyletto Madison Swivel Glider, Mocha","So the chair is beautiful and comfortable as expected, but I found that as an exhausted mother of a newborn, not having a headrest was as frustrating as I had guessed it would be. Based on other reviews of how great it was, even for tall people, I thought it would be ok. And it is OK I suppose, just not perfect. Doing it over, I'm not sure if I'd buy it again. I still love the aesthetic and it's great for rocking baby in the daytime, but for those first few weeks with middle of the night feedings it left me a bit stranded! I'm 5'7&#34; so not that tall, maybe if you were a bit shorter you could more comfortably crank your Neck back and rest head on the top of the chair, but even way slouched down that wasn't comfortable for me.Overall though, chair came in great condition, no issues with noises or squeaking or unbalanced swivel and we've had it 3 months.",4,1
"babyletto Madison Swivel Glider, Mocha","You've no doubt read all these other reviews and all are true.  This is the perfect little rocker glider for a small nursery like mine. It's perfect  for rocking even my 25 lb grandson to sleep. My 6'1 husband sits comfortably in it too. No problem nursing just wrap a Boppy around your waist.  If you saw the reviews about the uneven seating of the feet, unfortunately that is also true. The center plastic bolt is too thick making the rubber feet on the perimeter unable to reach the floor so the metal  base noisily rocked back and forth. I fixed this in 2 seconds flat by placing small round felt stick okn furniture pads to all the outer rubber feet. That elevated the swivel base higher than the center bolt. Now the ride is smooth and steady and whisper quiet. The size is perfect. The seat is cushy, the fabric is super soft and stain resistant so 5 stars for the little chair that could!!",5,1
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Lamp with Shade and Bulb, Bubbles and Squirt","This lamp is perfect, it is so cute.  It matches the entire set and is made of good quality materials.",5,1

"Skip Hop Zoo Little Kid Luggage, Dog","I have a 22-month old and a 4-yr. old. They both love their new luggage - I got the puppy and the monkey. Perfect size for the little ones, they love dragging it by themselves.",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Little Kid Luggage, Dog",Perfect for my two year old nephew!,5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Little Kid Luggage, Dog",I'm not sure if others just got defective bags or they are just super abusive with their luggage because my 5 year old lugged this by himself up the tiny corridor of steps to the second level on an Amtrak train several times and it still seems brand new. At first when it came I was like &#34;THIS IS SO TINY&#34; but when I loaded it up it really held a lot. Perfect my son because he always wants to &#34;help&#34; which I think we all know doesn't work. He can actually take care of this bag 100% on his own which makes traveling way less hectic.,5,1
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,Has worked great---our 15 month old has tested it out and hasn't been able to open the stove.  I would like to say how pathetic it is that a new stove made by Whirlpool (I really hope someone from Whirlpool could see this) doesn't have a lock that can be used while the stove is on and in use---unbelievable.  There is a lock on the stove but it can only be used when it's in self cleaning mode---are you kidding me?  So I have to rely on a plastic lock that sticks on the outside of the stove to keep my child from scalding himself---there is no excuse for a $500 stove to not have a lock that can be used any time you want to use it.  The Munchkin dual action lock works perfectly---they should contact Whirlpool and see if they can just make them for Whirlpool stoves to have them put on during the manufacturing process then Whirlpool would have a good lock for their stoves so people could keep their kids safe.,5,1
BecoThings - BecoPotty in Natural,"We wanted to do the EC technique with our baby and have been doing so straight out of the gates, around 3 weeks old.  However, it isn't easy trying to potty a newborn boy in the sink, as things tend to squirt everywhere trying to hold him in your arms and direct his stream.  This potty is absolutely PERFECT for him.  We just plop him right on it, click a few times, and off he goes.It is narrow enough for a young baby to use, straddling it like a saddle rather than a seat, like many of the other toilets out there.  The front is high enough that he doesn't pee out of the potty.  It really is the greatest potty for boys.  Zero complaints.",5,1
Wedgwood 2012 Holiday Ornaments Annual Baby's 1st Christmas Pink Carousel,This ornament is absolutely gorgeous.  It lives up to the reputation of the company.  It is the perfect first Christmas ornament for a precious little girl.,5,1
Chicco Lil Piano Splash Walker,"Most solid one. The seat goes really low, therefore perfect for a small baby like mine. I love the fact that the piano can be removed, leaving the tray for snack time. Would definitly recommand this one as a first choice. Maybe a little bit more expensive, but so worth it.",5,1
Kids' Sling Bookshelf with Storage Bins ESPRESSO,"This shelf was a big hit with my two year old, and it is great that she can now easily put away her books. It is sturdy, looks nice with our other dark furniture, and holds a lot of books. The drawers under are perfect for toys, too. The only downside is that the books all lean forward in their shelves, which looks a little odd, but functionally doesn't matter that much.",4,1
"Jill McDonald Kids First Year Keepsake Calendar, Alphabet Animals","I was looking for a 12x12 first year calendar that I could turn into a scrapbook.  I had one for my first son and had a hard time finding another one.  This one is perfect.  It's very cute, for a boy or a girl, well made and has cute stickers.  I only wish that the description would have said ""12x12"" because I wasn't sure how big it was when I ordered it.",5,1
Barin Toys Wooden Teether Sticks,"Bought this set of teething keys for my 7 month old to replace the plastic ones he had.  I was nervous to buy them because there was only one other review, but I'm so glad I took the chance.  These are great!  Perfect size for small hands, beautiful quality (no chance of wood splintering), no harmful chemicals.  I love the natural look to them.  My son loves gumming these!!  It took a while to receive them, just an FYI incase you are needing them yesterday :)",5,1
Squatty Potty 9&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,I feel like I'm in Heaven using the Squatty Potty. I feel completely empty after defecating.

Squatty Potty 9&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,I love my squatty potty.  I ordered a different one first and didn't like it.  I decided to give this one a try and I love it.  Fits around the toilet and perfect height for me.,5,1
"Chewy Tubes Super Chew Knobby, 2 Pack",My 4 year old has autism and chews on everything. This chew stick is perfect for him. We tie a shoe lace through the handle and he wears it around his neck all day. It has really cut down on his chewing of his shirts or fingers. It's been 2 months and it's holding up very well.,5,1
Plush Penguin Hat With Long Paws,Bought for my daughter for school.  She needed penguin outfit but still be able to use her hands...this was perfect.  She still wears it this winter.,5,1
Sand-Away Beach Bag ?,"This bag is large and perfect for all the beach toys.  It appears to be very strong.  Haven't tested it out at the beach yet.  Has a little bit of a smell when you first open it.  Also, I didn't realize when I bought it that it folds up in to the little case on the side.",5,1
"Malden Ceramic Milestone Picture Frame, My First Holy Communion, 4&quot; x 6&quot;","Frame was cracked when I received it. Not sure if it was the packaging, ups,  or what. I liked the frame so ordered another one. #2 came within 2 days and was perfect. So, I'm happy. Minimal inconvenience- just have to have plenty of lead time if giving as gift.. Just in case.",4,1
"Summer Infant Swaddleme Muslin Sack, Reptiles",I love this sleep sack.  It assures that my baby is covered and doesn't get the blankets in his face.  The material is thin and perfect for cool nights.,5,1
"babyletto Hudson Changer Dresser, Grey/White","(Note that I purchased the all white dresser that is no longer available.)  The dresser took a couple of hours to assemble, but was certainly do-able and not as frustrating as some reviewers claimed.  There were no scratches and it arrived in perfect condition.  The added cabinet with shelf adds quite a bit of storage for diapers, etc.I contacted BlissModern as the dresser was not available after placing the order and they were very prompt, professional and courteous, keeping me posted on the status of delivery.  It arrived a few weeks later than I expected, but in enough time to put it together before the arrival of baby.",5,1
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black",This functions and fits exactly as we expected.  We use it almost every time we use our stroller. It's perfect for going on walks around the neighborhood when you don't want to lug around EVERYTHING in the diaper bag.,5,1
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black","Nice and sturdy and good quality.  The cup holders are smaller (as many reviews mentioned) but good size for water bottle, small soda or similar.  Not recommended for hot drinks (but do you really want a hot drink by your baby?!)  Overall good quality for the price and fits perfect with my baby jogger mini select GT stroller!",5,1
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black","I bought this for my City Mini GT and it works great!  Perfect for drinks, cell phone, and keys storage.",5,1
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","We had a britax b-smart we bought in England for our first one. But with the arrival of the second one we had to get a double stroller and without hesitation we got britax again. It's a very good stroller, a little big maybe a little heavy too, but you can't expect it to be as light as a feather anyways. It's very smooth, perfect for long walks and shopping, it's priced right. One little thing that I don't like on the US version is the foam handle that my toddler keeps biting off. I'm planning to make a cover for it, so it's fixable. Other than that we absolutely love it!",5,1
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","I got rid of my phil & ted's dash stroller for this one and LOVE it! Love the 4 wheels, love that the tires are foam filled vs. air, as they never go flat!I also love that it folds well with the double seat attached, saves me the time of having to take it apart and store it separately!!It's a nice smooth ride, with shock absorbers going over bumps etc. and my newborn can sit in the back seat because it lies flat enough to be perfectly comfortable for him!",5,1
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","My husband and I absolutely love this stroller. We have a four year and an infant, so this stroller gives us the flexibility of a double stroller or single stroller as we need it.  We are constantly being asked by parents and parents to be about it, so here is what I tell them...It's great, all the accessories snap and click so easily that you almost think you are doing it wrong.The main seat clicks and turns forward or rear facing, easily.The available seat configurations with the lower seat and the lower car seat adaptor gives us a lot of options which keep both kids happy.It is a longer and wider than a single stroller but much smaller than a double stroller which is so great when we are out in tighter places.It steers nicely, even when loaded down with two kids and a bunch of stuff.The lower basket is quite accessible all the time, even with the lower seat attached because it has three zippers on the sides so you get all your stuff with out taking apart the stroller.It folds easily, even with all the second/lower seat stuff attached.It is VERY sturdy. I walk my daughter to school every day in it, over a mile each way, bumping over curbs and it is holding up, perfectly.I've seen complaints in reviews that this stroller is bulky, but seriously? Any stroller that is designed to hold two kids is going to have some bulk to it.  And all strollers have a learning curve.  I would recommend buying the Velcro stroller organizer, since there's not a parent tray.Overall, this stroller is worth every penny and I tell every parent I meet to buy it!",5,1
"Mary Meyer Baby Safari Soft Toy, Puppy","Got this for my newborn God daughter, super cute and super soft! Perfect for babies. Loved it and so does she!",5,1
"Carter's Plush Security Blanket, Bear","The Bear Security Blanket is even cuter in person than in the photo, and it the perfect size for little hands to hold and cuddle. Also, there are no small parts to come off. This will be a perfect gift for my granddaughter due in December.",5,1

Lambs &amp; Ivy Jake 5 Piece Bedding Set,"My husband and I have been looking for months trying to decide on the perfect baby bedding for our son. We wanted something cute but wouldnt cost us an arm and a leg to purchase. I was looking around on amazon and found the Jake bedding. I feel in love instantly and ordered it. The 5 piece set came in the mail yesterday and I set it up right away. It is perfect. We could not be more pleased with the colors, fabric, or design. It is perfect for our son that is due in October. Defiantly an A+++ BUY!!",5,1

"Ulubulu Universal Pacifier Clip, Oliver Owl",this fits any paci and the clip is strong! my little one will pull and tug and it stays clasped! perfect product and adorable!,5,1
"Ulubulu Universal Pacifier Clip, Oliver Owl","This is way better than past pacifier clips I have purchased in the past. Love the universal attachment, works perfectly with baby's Avent Soothie pacifier, and the clip part stays put on her clothes without damaging them. I like that the fabric itself is flat & wide, so I'm not so concerned about it getting wound tightly around her neck (although, of course, I still watch out for choking hazards). It is an adorable print, and it most importantly, helps with not losing the binky! A worthwhile investment, for sure!",5,1
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Hello Kitty Garden Sheet, Pink",These sheets are great!  I was pleasantly surprised to find that they are so soft.  They fit the crib mattress perfectly.,5,1
"HALO SleepSack Wearable Blankets Micro Fleece - Soft Pink &amp; Cream, 2-Pack, Large",My baby hates to be swaddled so this was perfect for her! Kept her warm but allowed her arms to be free!

Bright Starts Bounce Bounce Baby Activity Zone,This is the perfect activity zone for my almost five month old. It is smaller in size compared to others and I love that since I have twins and space is limited when you have two of these things going at once.,5,1
Manito Elegance Plus Stroller Weather Shield / Rain Cover (Red - 5 Available Colors),"I have a Mamas and Papas Sola stroller and their weather shield combo was >$80. Plus, it seemed like no one was offering it. I live in Minnesota so I needed something right away. I found this and decided that (for the price) it was worth the price. Plus, I know that if you have an issue with a product, Amazon does a good job in helping you out.So I got this and I'm glad.My son is still rear facing in his stroller because he likes to see my face. I was worried the cover would not fit until I turned it around. However, it fit just fine. There are these hooks that you use to secure the cover on to your stroller. With a little ingenuity, I was able to secure the cover while in rear facing position.My son likes it because I can use the flaps to give him more shade without obstructing his view. It vents well so he gets a lot of fresh air. Used with a bunting, he's perfectly comfortable on our strolls.",4,1
Manito Elegance Plus Stroller Weather Shield / Rain Cover (Red - 5 Available Colors),"I bought this to replace a generic plastic rain cover which presses against my baby's face whenever the wind is too strong. This shield is perfect. It's a bit expensive but well worth the price. Easy to install and easy to get my baby in and out through the window. She like to sit in it too, even at home :-)",5,1
"Swaddlebees Capri Cloth Diaper Cover SNAPS (size 2, Marina)","I am very impressed with these covers. My daughter is 7 months and about 20lbs with most of that in her thighs. It has been an experience trying to diaper her!I have been using primarily Flips with padfolded flats, and I really like them. But, the giraffe print got me and I had to order one of these.On the smallest setting, the size two is a great fit. I have it on the waist and leg snap setting shown in the stock pic, and its a perfect fit. The rise of the cover on the largest setting gets much higher than the Flip - I think these will truly last all children through potty learning.I usually gravitate towards aplix diapers for the fit, but the only one in stock in giraffe at the time was snaps so I bought it, and I am so glad I did. These covers don't have the stretchy tabs that the Flips do, but the snaps are configured brilliantly and the fit is excellent. There is no pulling or gaping and no wing droop.The Swaddlebees Capri cover does not leave red marks on my daughters legs, and the snap down rise does not add bulk. I am using these with a large (35x35) padfolded flat on the smallest setting and I fit it under leggings. I would say that the Flip is a trimmer cover under clothes, but I would not describe these as bulky - they lay well under clothing. I also tried it over a pinned premium prefold, and it covered all of the prefold - the Flip covers are too narrow through the bum to cover most pinned prefolds without considerable tucking.Of course, the point of a diaper cover is to contain all wetness and messes - the Capri rates 5 stars in those areas, too. I have yet to have a leak or a blowout.",5,1
"Swaddlebees Capri Cloth Diaper Cover SNAPS (size 2, Marina)",Super cute and fit perfectly!,5,1
"Sun Smarties Boy's Reversible, Adjustable UV Sun Hat SHARK MD","The straps help keep the hat on. My son was always taking his hat off. This helped us move past that. Now, he never even tries to take the hat off. He will even pick it up and try to put it on himself. I wasn't sure about sizing. My son has a larger head (90th percentile at 15 months old). The size small is a perfect fit for him. And it is so cute. We get so many compliments on this hat.",5,1
Gerber 6 pack Woven Washcloths 100% Cotton 9 x 9 Neutral,"Love these, perfect, soft, not too big (how much wash cloth do you need?), washes and drys well and doesn't curl up on the edges. Will be buying more.",5,1
"NUK Gerber Graduates Rest Easy Spoons, 5-Count","We tried different spoons including the Munchkin silicon spoons - that failed miserably. These are great! The spoon is not too wide for baby's mouth and the bowl of the spoon isn't too deep. So it is perfect as first spoon for your baby. When I put this spoon into my baby's mouth, he is able to draw the food into his mouth without splattering any across his face (if the bowl of the spoon is too deep, this happens!). The spoons are colorful and he loves looking at the spoons. I'm also able to leave this spoon in an empty bowl and it won't tip over. Very easy to clean too. Definitely recommend!",5,1

"American Baby Company Crib Starter Kit, Blue",Very soft sheets perfect starter set. Do not waste your money on fancy sheets this are simpleBut perfect for every day usage.,4,1
"Dream On Me Freedom Tandem stroller, Green","When I first got this stroller, taking it out of the box, I found that it was a lot more sturdy feeling than I was expecting from the reviews.  I understood from the reviews that this stroller was essentially a tandem umbrella stroller and essentially that is what it is, but with more features and built a lot better.  Double strollers are ridiculously expensive and at the $100 price point, my options were limited.  I could go with the side by side umbrella which seemed silly or this, which, despite the reviews, seemed to fit the bill.  Getting the shade on was a bit tricky and the instructions are quite vague, but once you figure it out, it seems to work well.Now I bought this stroller as an alternative to a large side by side jogging stroller which is my primary stroller.  My large side by side just can't fit into places and I needed something for things like Dr appointments or just going anywhere where space is an issue. I needed something compact enough to fit everywhere, but big enough to fit my two kids (18 months and 6 months).  At first, I was kind of disappointed because my 18 month old hated the front seat.  He would force himself to be hanging from the strap between his legs. After a while he gave up, but still looked uncomfortable (He is a big boy).  I put my 6 month old in the front and my 18 month old in the back and it was amazing.  He fits so much better in the back which is surprising because the seat looks smaller, but is designed differently so he is better supported.  He sits back there and is completely content and my 6 month old is perfect in the front, especially since her legs have better support.So bottom line, this is not meant to be your only stroller.  Most people with two kids stroller age, understand that different strollers fit different purposes.  Until these stroller manufacturers listen to mom's with multiple young children, our garages will be full of strollers for every occasion.  Buying this stroller and expecting it to be your all day, every day stroller is like buying a Smart Car and expecting the same functionality out of it for a large family that a Honda Odyssey will give.  This stroller is about as big as a single regular stroller, which, when needed, is awesome and hard to find.  It serves a purpose and that purpose it serves very well.The only downside is the front seat, which I wish they made it a little more like the back seat, while keeping the foot rest.",4,1

"Oopsy daisy Eric Carle, ?s Farm Peel and Place Childrens Wall Decals by Eric Carle, 54 by 60-Inch","Bought this for my 3 yr olds room.  He loves farm animals and cows are his absolute favorite.  This are nice and big. I put them on the main wall in his room and they fit perfectly. I love the colors and design of the animals. They stick really well and can easily be moved. More expensive than other ones I looked at, but well worth the price!",5,1

VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units,Great product until now works perfect ...good price also has a good and clear sound perfect for newborns in small places,4,1
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units,"These were a huge upgrade from our previous set.  No buzzing or feedback, they stay perfectly silent until our baby makes a noise.  And they pick up the noise very well (even shifting blankets) from several feet away.  Having the two reciever units is great for our house, we keep one in our bedroom and one between our kitchen and living room and NEVER have to move them.  The press-to-talk feature is occasionally useful for communication between the parents, when one of us is in her bedroom.  The battery life is not extremely impressive, but that's not an issue for us since we really don't have to move them.Our baby monitor used to be a stresser for us -- once we bought this we haven't really had to think about it since.",5,1
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,This monitor works perfectly. It picks up whenever my baby moves or makes a noise but is able to ignore the white noise I have playing while she naps. It has a sensitivity setting that I could decrease should I want to not hear every time she moves. The parental unit is rechargeable and can either be plugged in or not if you want to carry it around. For an audio monitor it does everything I need it to.,5,1
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,I ordered this baby monitor to replace an expensive Sony monitoring system I had gotten that was terrible.  This VTech monitor is great! Easy to use and works perfectly.  I highly recommend it.  Only ""con"" I can find is that the parent unit screen does not light up.  Sometimes hard to find buttons in the dark.,4,1
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,"I searched high and low for the perfect baby monitor.  This one was the closest I found without having to spend a small fortune.  I get great sound quality.  I like the talk back feature.  I can talk to my little baby through her monitor, with just the push of a button, until I make it back to her room.  Its a nice way to comfort her, and let her know Mama is coming.",5,1
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,"The vtech baby monitor has changed the way we do business on our farm.  When customers come to our farm stand, a driveway alert goes off in the house.  It is important in our small operation that we stretch family help as much as possible before hiring people to take care of customers.  Unfortunately we miss customers when we are working in areas where we can't see the farm stand or hear the driveway alert.  When we place the vtech baby unit next to the driveway alert we can clearly hear the alert through the parent units that we carry around with us.  Now we can work anywhere on the farm and never miss a customer at the farm stand.  It is an added bonus that the  units can act as walk-talky's.  The clip on feature for the parent units make them perfect for walking around with.  This is a very effective low tech solution for a serious communication problem. Thank you vtech.",5,1

"Evenflo Tribute Sport Convertible Car Seat, Daisy Doodle","- The fabric is plenty comfortable although some parents might prefer it with more cushion. I'm totally happy with it.- Adjusting the strap shoulder height and length is pretty standard and easy for me to do- It comes with the tethering at the top (which my car doesn't have) and the kind that latches on either side where the seat buckles are (which is what I have).- The 5 point latch is easy to snap together and take apart, easier than our Graco infant car seat.- This was one of the lowest priced car seats and I'm very happy with it. We bought two, one for each car, so we don't have to transfer it and at this price it is totally reasonable.- The seat angle/leveling it comes in was perfect for our car and didn't need to be adjusted.The only thing I wish I could order would be a replaceable cover just in case this one gets stained too badly or our next child is a boy (and doesn't like pink) but not a biggie. We had the Graco Snugride 30 (which was just okay) when our daughter was an infant and went straight to this for forward facing. Even though this is much cheaper, it felt like an upgrade.",5,1
"Evenflo Tribute Sport Convertible Car Seat, Daisy Doodle",It would have been perfect if it was for a younger child. I had to return it because the car seat was for a 3 year old who weighs 40 pounds.,5,1

"Baby Mile Catherine 3-in-1 Convertible Crib, Cherry","**UPDATED** We just received & assembled this crib.  We're still waiting on the occupant to arrive, but I wasn't able to find any really good reviews on this item before we purchased it so I wanted to share our experience.PROS:Gorgeous finished productColor is true to the pictureQuite sturdy - Made of solid wood except for drawer bottoms, etc, which are thinner particle board as is standardBigger changing table than most with integrated changersAssembly was as expected - took two of us less than 2 hours, instructions were generally very goodHardware was nicely labeled, making everything easy to findCONS:Arrived pretty heavily damaged.  Not shipping damage; These parts were painted, apparently ran over by a football team wearing cleats, then carefully packaged in the box.  Most parts weren't damaged, box wasn't damaged, foam packing was intact, just a handful of important, visible parts were damaged beyond acceptable.Changing table is still not a standard size & it doesn't come with a changing pad, so although it is bigger than most, you will still need to modify a standard changing pad.Warning stickers are securely, visibly adhered EVERYWHERE.  It's going to take some work to get enough of those cleaned off to be reasonably aesthetically pleasing.Drawers are SUPER shallow.  They are wide, but very shallow in height and depth.  I'd hoped to be storing our linens & diapering items in them, but we'll be lucky to fit a few basics in there.  Full-depth drawers would have been fantastic.There are two wrong steps in the instructions.  One says ""Insert dowel 12"" when it should say ""Insert dowel 5"", and a few steps later that same mistake is make in reverse.  The problem is, it's possible to incorrectly assemble using dowel 12 in the first mistake if the cross-member is installed backwards (the instructions don't specify directionality, and if you assume you must use dowel 12 then the wrong orientation seems like the only choice) If you're gluing like we were, it can create some trouble.Lots of exposed hardware.  The visible bits are all decent looking allens, but not chrome or stainless or anything.  Those little pop-plugs would have gone a long way to improve the aesthetics here.**Mattress height is not adjustable!**  My husband and I are both 6' and we're worried about what this is going to do to our backs in the long run.  If you're shorter, you can probably write this crib off.  I'm glad we assembled it a few months early; realistically, we're going to have to modify the crib so we don't end up with herniated discs from leaning waaaaay over to get the baby in & out.SUMMARY:Overall, we really like this crib.  There are a few bummers and a couple major issues that will need to be addressed, but I don't think it's anything insurmountable.  We're both happy with the overall quality and look of the piece, and we're especially pleased with the color.  We'll be contacting the company to see about replacing the damaged pieces & I'll report back when we have resolution.UPDATE:I was worried initially because it was impossible to contact the manufacturer by phone (the phone would ring a few times, then switch to a busy signal and disconnect).  I ended up emailing them instead and, although it took several emails back and forth, I was pleasantly surprised to receive the replacement headboard about 8 days after my first email.  It is in perfect shape and I am very pleased with how they handled the replacement.  I initially supplied them with pictures of the damage & a copy of my purchase receipt, then they asked for the PO# off the crib (mine was on the head of the changing table), additional clarification on the proof of purchase, and copies of the manufacturing information on the assembly booklet & registration card.  If you gathered all of these things ahead of time it would probably shave a few days off your replacement time.",4,1
"Prince Lionheart 2 Count Faucet Extender, Gray/Pink","What a great deal! And these things work perfectly. My kids love that they can reach the water now to wash their hands and help brush their teeth. They also love it when they push down on the end of the spout, let it go and water splashes all over. Small price to pay for getting them to wash their hands:)",5,1
"Valco Baby 2012 Zee Stroller, Jet","Ive been through a number of strollers due to gaps in my kids ages, and this one is my all time favorite. The fold is easy, the unfold is easier, and pushing is easiest of all. I love that it has a folded stand, its such an understated luxury! The canopy is huge, the seat is cushy, the footrest folds up so its straight which is great for sleeping babes. The basket is a good size too. And its lightweight. The recline is super flat and it can sit more upright than any other stroller Ive had.The only difference between this one and the newer one seems to be a movable handlebar, which might come in handy to the tall, but for me at 5'5&#34; the height is perfect.The sapphire color is a tan/gray. Its not as gray as the picture, but its not as tan as some google images would show you either. Its pretty though.I would absolutely recommend this stroller to anyone looking for one, you cant beat the price and the strollers in the same price range cant compete.Cons, none really.  In general I wish there were more color options, but there aren't any faults with the stroller!",5,1
"Babiators Unisex-Baby Infant Ops Junior Sunglasses, Black, Small","I bought these for my 2 year old nephew.

OWL GREEN Baby Leggings/Leggies/Leg Warmers- GIRLS &amp; ONE SIZE by BubuBibi,"My daughter is almost four months old and in love with her toes, I wanted something to keep her warm but allow full feet access.  I keep my house around 70 degrees and I usually keep my sweet girl in footed sleepers when we are hanging around the house.  They are a little long at the moment so a lot of the time she looses her toes because she is pulling them off, but she will grow and she seems to enjoy the challenge. Our baby's room has an owl theme so these adorable owl leg warmers fit perfectly into our decor.  I like that they have pink but are not overwhelmingly pink.",4,1

"Skip Hop Memory Foam Stroller Liner, Green","This liner saves my Uppababy stroller. It gets really dirty after numerous trips to the park, but the stroller seat is nice and clean. Our liner has been thru a lot. I like that it's comfy and easy to care for. I just wish it fit nicer on Uppababy Vista. It works perfectly with Bugaboo stroller, but it's a bit too wide for the Vista stroller. The liner is a bit wider on the bottom and in the mid section. But it covers the whole bottom part of the toddler seat, so I'm happy. The pocket on the bottom part of the liner is great for storing some extra napkins or wipes.I wish I purchased this liner before my daughter started walking, it is easier to wash this liner than to wash the seat. I especially appreciate having this liner on a wet day when my daughter's shoes are covered in dirt.",4,1
"Philips AVENT 8 Ounce Natural Glass Bottles, 2-Pack","I used both the 4 oz and the 8oz bottles for my daughter. the slow flow nipple were ideal flow when breastfeeding. i had used the evenflow glass bottles earlier, since they fit on the medella punp, but those nipples were extremly fast, these on the other hand, due to wide nipple and slow flow were the perfect match for breast feeding and bottle feeding combination.i am now using fast flow nipples. they have not leaked, they are a little softer than the original nipples after a lot of sterlization.Only con is there is no sippy cup spout that fits the rings on these bottles, so if i have to use sippy spouts to transition to sipper, i will have to look for new bottles",4,1

"Delta 48 Piece Nursery Storage Set, Beige","Great starter set for a new baby's closet.  Hangers are the perfect size for baby clothes and the 3 small bins fit into the hanging organizer like drawers.  Color is neutral and great.  The dividers and stickers were kind of worthless in my set though.  Most of the stickers wouldn't peel off the sheets, so they ripped and had to go in the trash.  It didn't really matter though - the dividers just spin around the closet rod, they aren't weighted, so even if you manage to get the stickers onto them, chances are slim the label will actually be visible.  Not a big deal.  For the price, everything else was great!  If I need dividers I can pick those up elsewhere.  All in all this was a great purchase, and I'm pretty picky.",4,1
"Delta 30 Count Set of Kids Velvet Hanger, Beige","I'm going to have to get creative when she gets older. They're the perfect size for baby and toddler clothes, but too small for anything else.

Britax Vehicle Seat Protector,"This is the perfect seat protector for a britax seat. We use it on leather seats with a britax frontier 85. It is wide so may not fit small seats or fit 2-3 in a row. With trusted brand of Britax that exceed safety recommendations and testing, I feel comfortable using this mat versus an after market product. It is easy to clean, prevents seat dents and I love the flap that hangs over to protect the car's seat from muddy feet or dripping juice.",5,1
Britax Vehicle Seat Protector,"I purchased this item to go along with a Britax Booster seat.  It works great!  the seat itself fits into the &#34;pocket&#34; perfectly.  There is a lip that covers the front of the seat, so that older children (taller children) will not be resting dirty/muddy feet on the seat itself.  The item is made of a heavy duty silicone type of plastic that is not stiff, but rather pliable and comfortable.  It does not interfere with seatbelt action in either of my autos (a mid size sedan and an suv).  I am very glad i purchased this item!",5,1

It's also ideal for an office or school lunch bag.  It configures well to the carrier it is in.It can be turned inside out for quick wipe-downs and drying.  A zipper keeps the odor to a minimum.  The material is strong enough to last for many uses.  Another thing I like is that the material doesn't smell nor carry an odor over to the food.",5,1

The quality is great - well worth the money, especially since Amazon had the most competitive pricing! Plus, knowing it has the highest ratings in safety makes me very comfortable! The fabric is perfect! I love the recline feature. It is a bit heavy, but who cares! Once it's in, it's in! Buy it, you'll be glad you did!",5,1
"Britax Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","I bought this seat to replace our Britax Marathon Classic car seats due to a crash.  I loved how easy the classic was to properly tighten the straps and general use of the seat.  I am pleased with this new seat and the updates and new features!This Marathon 70-G3 is equally easy to fit to the child, plus you can adjust the strap height with the lever located at the top of the seat back.  This means no longer removing the strap, unlacing, then relacing through the seat.  Another new feature I like is that the crotch buckle now has 2 settings.  Since the weight limits have gone up for both forward and rear facing, it makes sense to be able to move the crotch buckle to accommodate a larger child.The user manual is very important for a car seat.  For your child's safety you should always read it in its entirety prior to use of the seat, and again when you need to adjust strap height.  I appreciate that this seat has a built-in elastic casing to store the manual behind the lower back in the seat cover. This is much more convenient than the Classic.The cover has new overlapping flaps behind the child's back for access to new car seat belt lock offs.  It makes securing the seat with the seat belt easier, since you can see what you're doing, which is always a plus.My 2 kids that are in this style seat are 2.5 (rear facing, 36"" tall, 33 lbs) and 5 (forward facing, 45"" tall, 45 lbs).  Both are very comfortable and have plenty of room to grow in these seats.  My rear facing child is perfectly happy doing so, just has her knees bent and ankles crossed.I love that this seat's features makes it so easy to properly use and adjust to keep it fitted appropriately as your child grows.",5,1
"Britax Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx",That's the question I was asked when someone saw it. My 14 month old loves this seat. I just turned him around and he's very comfortable.The seat fits perfect in my 2013 odyssey. There was no adjusting or anything to make it fit.This is my second Britax. I still have the first from my six year old and using it for my 14 month old in our other vehicle. Durable. Trustworthy. Reliable.,5,1
"Britax Roundabout 55 Convertible Car Seat, Isabella","We love the seat, my baby is six months old and can't wait to go for a ride. it has lots of cushioning, the velvety cover is very soft.and the seat easy to install, its not as big as it looks. I drive a Honda Civic it fits perfect in the back seat.I would highly recommend this, and all Britax products. you will be very pleased with this seat,so Im giving it five stars!!!",5,1
"Britax Roundabout 55 Convertible Car Seat, Isabella","I wanted a ""cheap"" seat for our second car, which is a 2010 Toyota Corolla, that would not compromise safety.  The Recaro ProRide I bought for this car was too large to install rear-facing, and I read reviews that said this seat installs well in smaller cars.  It really does!  Even fully reclined in the rear-facing position, the seat does not have to be all the way forward, leaving plenty of room for the front seat passenger.  It has a reasonable price tag but is still very nice, and is still very safe compared to some of the even cheaper Evenflo and Graco models.  Those just didn't seem good enough to me.  The fabric is soft and nice enough, and I don't feel we need all the bells and whistles for a seat that will not get used as much as the one in our primary vehicle.This seat installed in a snap!  It was soooo much easier than the ProRide, and I feel that it's very, very tight and very secure.  It took less than 5 minutes.  The LATCH straps tighten easy and one read-through of the instruction manual (very easy to understand) explained how to adjust everything quickly and easily for my 3-month-old son.  He enjoys sitting in it as much as any car seat, even though sometimes he is not a fan of the car.If you are looking for a very nice seat for not a lot of money, this is it.  If you are looking for a convertible seat with a reasonable rear-facing footprint, this is it.  If you are looking for a safe, stylish seat on a budget, this is it.  It's perfect.  I wish I'd bought one for both cars.Update 5-18-13We have been using this seat for over 7 months now, and although I still think it's a reasonably priced, easy-to-install seat and perfect for a second car, I like the Recaro better.  The Recaro has headrests for my son's head when he falls asleep, which will also help protect him in the event of a crash.  He also sits up higher in the Recaro and can see outside better.  If I didn't have experience with the Recaro I would have been perfectly happy with this, but as it stands, it's not my favorite as a primary seat.",4,1
"Britax Roundabout 55 Convertible Car Seat, Isabella","After a car accident, we had to quickly purchase a new car seat for our toddler. (As in, run to a box store in the middle of the night so we could take her home). What we ended up with was a piece of junk.So I asked friends, did a ton of online research, and landed on the Britax. I love this carseat. We used it rear-facing until my daughter turned 3, and it worked great. We take it on airplanes and use it for travel, and it works great for front-facing as well. The padding is all removable (with some elbow grease) in case of accidents or spills. The seat seems soft and comfortable enough, but the seat is super sturdy and I feel safe riding with my daughter in it.My only complaint is that while the safety latches are easy to attach and release (thank GOD!), it is next to impossible to adjust the straps they're attached to. So while the latches pop out easily, trying to lengthen the straps to get them on a different seat is almost as bad as our other junky car seat. Lots of cursing and sweating usually entail.Also, the tether strap is REALLY long. I understand this is for larger vehicles, but I swear that thing is 7 feet long. It gets a little cumbersome switching the seat out or taking it through an airport with a python of a strap attached. So, it's picky little things that keep me from giving this a perfect rating, but it's really close.",4,1
"Britax Roundabout 55 Convertible Car Seat, Isabella","Nice car seat. It reclines well. It looks quite comfortable. It does not work as well backwards in our car, though. It just won't anchor as well backwards. It's perfect for the 16 month old because we can keep it a bit reclined in the forward-facing, which makes it safer.",4,1
Baby Looney Tunes Nature Fantasy Diaper Stacker,Holds a lot of diapers!! Matched my daughters baby Disney theme perfectly. Ties are nice and sturdy where it is attached to the wall.,5,1
Spectra Dew 350 Advanced Double Electric Hospital Grade Breast Pump with Tote!,"I had previously purchased the Spectra 9 from Mother's Milk and was enjoying it's use until it began to stop suctioning correctly. I ended up returning it, with a full refund. Since I was out a pump, I desperately looked for another. I FINALLY settled for the Spectra Dew. I had it overnighted so my supply would not drop (it had already dropped about 2 ounces from having to go to a manual pump for 3 days). Amazon quoted me an arrival date of October 26, 2012 - October 29, 2012... I got upset because I had paid $85 for overnight! Well, to my surprise, I messaged them to cancel the order and they informed me that it would INDEED ship in one day, and offered to send it to me still. I agreed, and they gave me a $30 discount for the trouble.This pump is absolutely AMAZING. I used it RIGHT AWAY!!!! It drained my breasts in 20 minutes (both), and quietly at that. My baby was right next to me sleeping and it didn't even stir him. It sounds EXACTLY like a person breathing heavily. The neck of the nipple shields are wide, so it's nice for larger areolas because you can get more in and you won't have to buy additional shields. The suction is fantastic, it pulls gently yet firmly so that it does not pull painfully, but pulls hard enough to get ALL your milk out. You don't even have to fuss with your breasts to squeeze out the milk that any other pump would leave stuck near the base of your breasts (I wear a 38 J nursing bra, so you can tell how far my milk has to travel and how hard it can be for boobs this big to fuss with a pump).I promise you will not regret buying this pump. Don't waste your money on other hospital grade pumps or whatever else. THIS is the perfect pump.",5,1
"Bumkins Waterproof Splat Mat, On The Go","This mat is perfect as it's very easy to clean and doesn't attract static electricity or food to itself. But I wish the manufacturer made them twice this size as a toddler sitting on a highchair would surely try their best throwing power and I always have to clean up around this mat instead of inside of it. Very good concept, but doesn't work well for my son!",4,1
Ubbi Cloth Diaper Pail Liner,"I haven't had any of the issues with the bag sticking to itself like some of the other reviewers, so I'm guessing that means that they fixed their supply issues. The bag fits the bin perfectly. It's very high quality, and washes great.  I bought two so that I have one in the bin while the other is in the wash. I think this is a must have for any cloth-diapering parents.",5,1
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator CRYSTAL With Extra Nose Tip and Mouth Piece | #1 Tested Snot Sucker,"I chose this after reading reviews of this and the Nosefrida, which I almost bought instead. I opted for this one mostly because there was no need to buy separate filters, you just use tissues as filters. My 2 month old baby hates things being poked in his nose, and although this barely enters his nostrils, he cries, but it works! I've been able to effectively suction lots of stuff out of his nose, and once I'm done, he's perfectly fine. It comes with a mesh pouch to allow for vented drying after you wash the parts. Definitely a great purchase for a congested baby.",5,1
"Bedtime Originals Plush Elephant Rosie, Purple","Elephant Rosie Is Too Cute, Very Soft & Squeezable for little hands.  I was looking for a stuffed animal with Cloth Eyes, and this Elephant fit my needs perfectly, NO Button Eyes on this Plush! The Color is Just like the photo, and the Flower on the top of the ear is adorable.The only downside is the way it is shipped, very scrunched, so much so that the elephants trunk looked like it was a tail!  I had to really work the trunk until it was in the middle of the face.  That Should Not Happen!  Shame on their Shippers!  I did not take off a star for the Bad packing of the elephant!I also purchased Monkee Ollie, this monkee is so soft and adorable, that my 3 1/2 month old grand baby just loved it from day one.  It is his favorite stuffed toy!  It is very well made and stands up to lots of loving!  Ollie also has Cloth Eyes, which is a Must for infants.  Ollies color is also just like his photo.  I have had a hard time finding stuffed toys for infants, with cloth eyes.  These two really are made for infants, or any children.  But they are not teeny tiny.  They are a nice soft huggable size!  If you are looking for an adorable soft huggable cloth eyed stuffed animal, look no further.",5,1

Bath Support Seat,"Fits perfectly into my baby bathtub, and holds baby well. This is the second time I purchased this product since putting on and off the frame to throw in the machine did cause wear and tear. But that's going through 3 kids, so I definitely give it a thumbs up!",5,1

"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Siren","This stroller is the perfect size.  It does not take up to much room in my trunk, it easily folds down, it is light weight.  It is a good step up from an umbrella stroller which tends to be too short, and has no room to put anything.  This stroller has a basket underneath as well as cup holders for the adult and for the child in the stroller.",5,1
"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Siren",The stroller is easy to open and close and it steers remarkably well for how inexpensive it was.  The pink color makes it perfect for my granddaughter when she visits me.,5,1
"aden + anais Serenity Star Electronic Sleep and Feeding System, White","Aden + Anais has fast become one of the ""trendier"" companies that new parents have begun obsessing over. I recently sat in on a conversation with several young mom's and heard nothing but glowing feedback concerning the mish-mosh of baby-related products that they put on shelves in elite locations. When I decided to grab this for my cousins new baby I was hesitant about the overall scope of what this could actually do yet the overall aesthetic of the star perfectly matched her shabby chic nursery design. White accents were on her must-have list and I knew this would (AT LEAST) look super cute against the plethora of cutesie odds and ends lining her insanely beautiful room. But, I wasn't expecting the incredibly positive feedback about the actual features of the system that I wound up getting from her!She ADORES this surprisingly handy star!She has told me how helpful this has been with keeping track of her daughter's feedings and how it saved her from the dreaded notepad and pencil by the glider that became tedious with her first child. This just takes a couple times adjusting to the navigation of the buttons and you are good to go! She told me how she felt it was slightly tricky at first with the placing of the buttons but once she got used to them she was quickly a pro at maneuvering and manipulating every aspect of the device.She also beamed over the room temperature indicator since her colonial home tends to get chilly and that was a huge concern for her and her husband. She checks on it regularly and told me it gives her peace of mind knowing her daughter is in a completely acceptable climate.My friend also mentioned that she initially received a teddy bear that made noises (white noise and heart-beats) but that this out-performed as far as lulling her cranky babe to sleep. The timer setting was useful and made everything super easy to set and forget.Finally, she mentioned the brilliance of including both a plug-in option and a battery charged option for her frequent road trips to her in-laws 6 hours away. She just keeps batteries with her and doesn't have to worry if she isn't near an outlet.Overall, I am extremely pleased with how well this has worked out for my cousin and her new baby!",5,1

Go Anywhere Booster Travel Seat - Red/Black,"This seat is a perfect for parents of children for anytime you might be eating away from home.  Leave one at the Grandparents house, take it on holiday or even out to your local restaurant.  Our little one is safely strapped in with the 5 point harness and the seat is secured to any chair we've ever tried it on.And it looks great too, (we had a pink one and then gave that to a friend and got the new color black & red one).  It wraps up into a tiny messenger bag, we would highly recommend it to anyone - A Parent Company got it out to me super quick.5 stars!!!",5,1
Playtex VentAire Advanced 4 Pack 9oz,"After trying both the Avent classic and Avent Natural bottles, as well as the wide-mouth Dr. Browns bottles, I decided to give these bottles a shot as per my SIL's recommendations. I was weary about trying them, especially after reading reviews about how they leak or they don't vent like Playtex claims they do...But these bottles work exactly how they claim to, if you READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!! make sure all pieces are completely dry before assembling and they will not only vent properly, but they won't leak! also, if you over-tighten the bottom piece, they won't vent as well as they should, but we only had that problem the first couple times Daddy assembled a bottle, and things have been smooth sailing ever since. Also, the instructions say to only sterilize the nipple and silicone piece for the bottom vent or the bottles will warp and leak... My LO was old enough to wear I was only boiling nipples once a week, but I did experiment with just dunking the other parts in boiling water and they did not warp. I know some people are obsessive about sterilizing, I was at first, so maybe use a different bottle until the time comes to do away with perfectly sterilizing everything?&lt;a href=[...]",5,1

"Regalo My Cot Portable Toddler Bed, Pink","My husband works out of town so we do a lot of traveling to visit...which includes a lot of hotel stays. When he is off we do a lot of traveling for vacation...which includes a lot of hotel stays. My 2 year old daughter was having to sleep in the bed with us and she would stay up till very very late and kick and rollover because she was excited to sleep in the bed with us. The first time I put the cot up we were on vacation and she immediately grabbed her blanket, pillow, and bear and &#34;made&#34; her new bed.  I should note my daughter has been in a toddler bed in her own room since 17 months. She did cry the first night because she wanted to sleep with us, but if we were in the room she would lay down with no problems. The cot is not comfortable to my standards for sleep, but my daughter did fine with a thick fuzzy blanket underneath her while she slept. The best part about this cot is it folds up like a folding chair and slides into the bag easily. Doesn't take much room to store in the closet at home. Durable and perfect for away from home easy sleeping for little ones.",5,1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Toddler Bed, Pink","This is really a cute cot, It was the perfect size for a toddler who sleeps in a toddler bed at home. The stiff fabric is really very noisy but we put a folded up blanket in between the cot and the cover, then put a crib sheet on top, and voila! a kid bed for the hotel without her having to be in a crib or taking up all the room that a rollaway does. I have suggestions: 1. use a folded blanket and a crib sheet for more comfort, 2. push up next to a bed or a wall and put a suitcase next to the head of the cot for a railing so a toddler can't fall out of bed, 3. pull the cot up by just squishing together during the day so the maid doesn't stand or sit on it, 4. take it out at home and let the toddler get used to it before springing it on her away from home. The cot is sturdy! Even though mom was warned that it only holds 75 pounds she laid down on the edge of it with the toddler and no breaks. It is hard to put back in the bad, but we put a bungee cord on it and it slid in perfectly!",4,1
"Stork Craft Aspen 6 Cube Organizer/Change Table, Black","I ordered this product because it matched the Storkcraft Aspen set I ordered, the dresserStork Craft Aspen 5 Drawer Chest, Cherry(CAUTION --- DO NOT BUY THE DRESSER - IT IS HORRIBLE!!) and the Vittoria CribStork Craft Vittoria 3-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, Cherry.  I ordered the Cherry.  The assembly instructions were confusing and frustrating, but my husband and I got the job done in a few hours.  The finish scratches easily, but we figure our little boy will be scratching the furniture anyway once he is moving around and the scratches are not anything that scratch cover cannot conceal.  For the price, you can't beat this changing table.  Once it was put together, it was very sturdy.  It does come with a very thin flat changing pad mattress, which I don't use.  As other reviews point out - the changing pad mattresses are slightly too large. Instead, I replaced with a contoured changing pad mattress (standard size) and squished it into the top.  This was a tight fit, as the top was designed for a slightly smaller mattress, but I made it work because I wanted the thick contoured mattress.I also had checked the dimensions for each bin prior to ordering, so I knew they were smaller than a normal canvas bin.  I waited until the table was put together and measured again, in hopes that the measurements in person would be slightly bigger, but they were not.  However, I searched canvas storage bins on Amazon, and found some that fit perfectly.  Honey-Can-Do Decorative Canvas Storage Bin, in the SMALL work great!Honey-Can-Do SFT-01992 Decorative Canvas Storage Bin, Sky Blue, SmallThey slide in and out and I can even put stickers with labels on them if I want to in the future.  The only problem was is they were backordered at the time - so I have to wait an additional month to receive four more.  At that time, I plan to upload some pictures showing the table and how I have organized it.I recommend buying this - but only if you have the extra money to invest in storage bins that fit.  I think the table is clearly labeled with the dimensions for the storage and the top, so if you don't read that, then don't blame the manufacturer for your dissatisfaction.Good luck - and have fun decorating your nursery!",5,1
"Stork Craft Aspen 6 Cube Organizer/Change Table, Black",Just the right size and match!  Nice deep slots perfect for storage and bins in front.  Will make a great shelf after changing pad is no longer needed.,5,1
"Stokke Tray, White","We've been using this tray for a few months and it has been a wonderful addition to our Tripp Trapp setup. Yes, this tray can be used only with the baby set. The entire point of having a Stokke Tripp Trapp is that you will pull your child up to the table with you when they no longer need the baby set. That said, if you have the baby set model stated in the description, the tray snaps in quickly and securely, and is perfect for babies who are eating solids, but need an edge to contain the mess and help them ""corner"" their food.The tray wipes down easily and can go in the dishwasher for a thorough cleaning.",5,1
Sequined Butterfly Mobile,"These butterflies are adorable! I bought the mobile which was perfect for the ceiling. I added some more fishing line and it hung as I wanted.

"North American Bear Company Baby Long Legs Puppy Squeaker, 8&quot;","I hesitated to buy this because I saw that some of the reviewers complained about it's small size.  What a silly complaint!  It's meant for a baby afterall.  It's the perfect sized little toy for my one year old.  The legs, arms, ears, and nose all provide different places for her to chew, and she likes that he makes a little squeaking sound, too.  It is smaller than I expected but I don't think my daughter would have wanted it to be any bigger.  This is a great toy.",5,1
"Sanrio 4 Piece Toddler Bedding Set, Hello Kitty and Friends",I'm very happy with this purchase.. the  sheets and blanket  turned out to be super soft. .. better  than the high thread count bedsheets I have at home!

"Nuby 2 Count Super Straw Easy Gripper, 10 Ounce","I've searched high and low for the perfect straw cup. Countless options I've tried have leaked, and almost every single one seems to have the same problem: when it's taken out of the fridge, the temperature change causes pressure inside of the cup, forcing liquid out through the straw. That's physics for you. If the cup doesn't have a valve, forget about it - it WILL come out of the straw. Even with a valve, it seems like no one can get the design right because I've tried bottle after bottle, with valves and without valves, and the same thing happens in all of them.Except for these.These are the first straw bottles I've tried that DO NOT have that problem - the valve on them is great! And with the way the top of the straw is designed, there is little to no spillage when the bottle gets knocked over. Granted - it took a while for my little one to figure out how to drink from it, but it ended up being a piece of cake.I highly recommend these bottles. If, like me, you're searching for a cup that you don't have to be extra-careful around (don't want to accidentally snag the straw top and fling liquid everywhere!), look no further: this is The Cup.",5,1
Piyo Piyo Baby Nail Scissors for Baby's Nails Pack of 3,"These scissors may seem pricey, but they are worth ten times as much due to the tears they have saved my infant from crying. In the beginning, I made the mistake of purchasing nail clippers supposedly made for babies at the local drugstore. What a disaster! I was too nervous to even try them out and my husband ended up cutting our daughter's skin twice! It drew blood and our baby screamed each time. My husband felt so guilty, and it was terrible to watch so I set out to find something safer. These scissors are a dream come true. They slip easily between the nail and the skin so there is never any fear of cutting our poor baby again. I love the rounded tip, and the slight curve creates the perfect angle for cutting nails.  They are so easy to use, I can even clip my daughter's fingernails while I nurse her. Best baby purchase yet!I've seen the single pack of this item go as low as $6 (and as high as $13) and this three pack is currently selling for $20.  Thus, it would be a better deal just to buy three of the singles if you have time to monitor the price.  Just thought that information might be helpful to others since Amazon's prices fluctuate so much. I purchased mine from the seller ""CP Cosmetics.""",5,1

These also hold a TON of liquid and his pants still stay dry. And he goes much more than the average child, plus he's just starting so these have to hold almost the same as a diaper.

I know they are a little expensive but so worth it.,5,1
B.box Essential Sippy Cup in Blue - 6 Oz,"My son has feeding issues and this cup has been a huge help.  We are weaning him from a feeding tube.  While he is doing great with solids, he was hesitant to drink anything but water.  When his speech therapist gave us the b.box cup, he started drinking 4 ounces of juice a day!  Now, 6 weeks later he is drinking 6 to 8 ounces of juice a day.The straw has a slotted top (x-shaped) and is slimmer than most straws so the volume per suck is less than most cups but doesn't require any more strength.  The weight on the end really works.  He knows not to fully tip a straw cup but this helps him to not have to hold it perfectly straight down.The cup has leaked a few times when in my backpack, but actually I am glad it is not an airtight seal.  My son likes to blow bubbles and he can do this without the liquid backing up the straw when he's done unlike other spill-proof straw cups.  It also doesn't have that suction feel as he drinks.I glued two big google eyes to the top of the green cup so it looks like a frog- his favorite animal.  This is an awesome cup.",5,1
B.box Essential Sippy Cup in Blue - 6 Oz,"I bought this as the first cup for my baby. She learned how to use it quickly. I have had no leaks so far. you do need to make sure you put the lid on correctly, I like to turn it the opposite way until it fits on just right and gets on track and then turn it to close it. I like that my baby doesnt have to tilt her head back in risk of her falling backwards since her balance isn't quite perfect yet. The only thing that may be difficult is the cleaning of the straw, I think I read they have special cleaning untensils, they should include that with the product, but they don't. overall I would by again! =)",5,1

However we've used it both on our regular stroller and jogging stroller, and it performs well enough to get an a-plus parental rating.",4,1

Simba Baby Rotary Spinning Bottle and Nipple Brush set (BPA Free),"I'm so embarrassed to admit how dirty my baby bottles used to be!  After weeks of using my Dr. Brown bottles, I noticed the insides of the bottles were quite slick.  I didn't see any residue, but I couldn't remember if the bottles were this slick out of of the box so I Googled it.  Sure enough, the greasiness was basically a layer of fat build up from my breast milk. Along with my dish soap, I tried hot water, vinegar, soaking and shaking but nothing worked to remove the greasiness until I bought this sponge set.The large sponge fits perfectly into my Dr Brown bottles.  At first it might feel snug but the snugness helps create the friction needed to clean the bottles.  The smaller sponge first perfectly into the wide part of the blue things on the DB bottles and nipples.  I get the sponge nice and soapy, swish it around the bottle a few times (circular and up and down motions), and then rinse with hot water.  On the rare occasion that the inside still feels slick, then I do it again.  My bottles come out squeaky clean!",5,1
Simba Baby Rotary Spinning Bottle and Nipple Brush set (BPA Free),"I swear... the brushes on the first two pages of Amazon suck. They are scratchy, huge and have bristles like you were scrubbing a metal pan. Why??? Not to mention, those all far apart and suck. I know. I've had more than one.This one from Simba I stumbled upon somewhere around page 3 or 4 of the results for &#34;bottle brush&#34;. I can't believe it isn't more popular! The small brush is perfect for tiny bottles and nipples. I use the little one to get into the little Medela bottles that came with my pump.The big fat brush has a rotating handle. The sponge on the end has two textures! Four sides are very soft and two sides are slightly rougher. This both scrubs the bottle and gets into all the tiny cracks of it. Honestly, such a simple design but so perfect. The sponges are replaceable if they get stained or gross. Overall, I'm extremely happy with these brushes and will include this in gifts I get for future soon-to-be-parents. I'm going to check out the other stuff from this brand. The box came entirely in Chinese so that was kinda interesting :)",5,1
"Status Veneto Glider and Nursing Ottoman, White/Beige","Quick delivery. ..very comfortable. ..easy or rather minimal assembly. ..and the arm chairs are the perfect height for nursing.  My only request is that at times I wish the chair had a recliner feature. Other than that, I love my chair!!!",5,1
"Status Veneto Glider and Nursing Ottoman, White/Beige","I RECIEVED THIS CHAIR SOONER THAN EXPECTED WHICH IS GREAT! I ALSO LOVE THE COLOR (GREY) AND HOW SMOOTH THE SLIDER PART IS ON THE CHAIR. IT IS VERY COMFTY AND IS PERFECT SIZE FOR ME (5'8'') AND JUST A TINY BIT SMALL FOR MY HUSBAND WHO IS 6'1''. I WOULD GIVE THIS PRODUCT A 5 STAR RATING, HOWEVER WHEN THE PRODUCT ARRIVED THE BOX HAD A HUGE HOLE IN IT AND WHEN OPENED EVERYTHING WAS GOOD EXCEPT THE OTTOMAN HAD A HUGE GASH IN THE NURSING STOOL PART THAT PULLS OUT. THE PRICE WAS FAIR BUT I;M JUST DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THE GASH IN THE OTTOMAN THAT WAS THE MAIN FEATURE THAT SET APART THIS CHAIR FROM CHEAPER ONES WHICH DIDNT HAVE TO PULL OUT NURSING OTTOMAN. I WOULD TRY TO RETURN IT BUT I THINK ITWOULD BE A PAIN TO HAVE TO TAKE APART THE CHAIR AND RE BOX IT AND THEN HAVE TO SHIP IT BACK.",4,1
"Status Roma Glider and Nursing Ottoman, White/Beige",The glider is the perfect tool to nurse your baby! My wife use it all the time. It came with 2 pockets at each side that are very handy to store your baby stuff. I put it together within a few minutes. The box needs to be handle by 2 people but I did it myself ( not a good idea if you have back problems) .Cons: Not to much. It can be a little noisy if you push it to hard. That's all.Good purchase at a good price. The glider got delivered in a timely manner.,5,1
"Baby Boom Nap Mat, Dino Adventure",This is perfect for school and the Dino lover.the pillow is just enough and the sheet are kinda thin but great for nap time,5,1
Zachary Plush Whale,"It is the perfect size , and super cute . I would definitely recommend this whale to anyone ! So glad I found it because it matches the MiGi crib sheet perfectly !",5,1
Munchkin Complete Edge and Corner Cushion Kit,"Well constructed corners.  I also bought a cheaper version on Amazon, which worked, but wasn't visually appealing due to seeing excess glue on the corners.  This color perfectly matched table and really isn't that noticeable.",5,1
"Fantasy Furniture Roundy Chair Gingham, Pink",Terrific  &#34;big girl&#34; chair for my granddaughter. It's sturdy and just the right size for little people. And the color was perfect.,5,1
"Fantasy Furniture Roundy Chair Gingham, Pink","I bought this chair for my daughter and she loves it! Super cute! The only thing I would say wasn't perfect was it was smaller than I thought it would be, but I also did not look at the dimensions on the description. Overall it's a really cute chair.",5,1
"Fantasy Furniture Roundy Chair Gingham, Pink",Super cute chair! Lightweight and perfect for toddlers! My 16 month goddaughter LOVES it! The moment she opened it she grabbed her book and sat down to &#34;read&#34;!,5,1
"Fantasy Furniture Roundy Chair with Microsuede Ottoman, Hot Pink",Its the perfect size for her and the fabric is very easy to clean.  Shipped quickly and I am tempted to get another one for downstairs.,5,1
"Fantasy Furniture Roundy Chair with Microsuede Ottoman, Hot Pink",I just received the chair! Its even better in person! I bought it for my daughters 1st birthday and its perfect for her. Chair is very soft and doesnt look cheap. Its absolutely adorable and i couldnt be happier with my purchase. Also it arrived the day it said it would.,5,1
"Fantasy Furniture Roundy Chair with Ottoman, Leopard",My daughter loves this chair...... it was perfect gift. The only down side is ....she climbs all over it...but she is 1 that's what they do!!!so she does need some supervision when we have it in the middle of the living room...,5,1
Bearskin Rug,"I bought this for my stepdad's &#34;Man Cave&#34; and it was the perfect present. It's an adorable little rug with rich color, soft fur, and charming claws. It's about the size of a bath mat or small bath towel*, so for a gag gift, it's not awkwardly big or expensive. My stepdad has it atop the whiskey cabinet, kind of like a little table runner. If you're even thinking about buying it, go for it. When else are you going to be able to say you have a bearskin rug?*Too small for Burt Reynolds",5,1
"Babymel Ruby Rucksak Diaper Bag, Mocha","I love love love this bag. Isn't ridiculous with the pockets (i get disorganized with too many pockets. I start shoving things in randomly and then can't find anything. I'm much better at making a system with a smaller number of pockets) - there are four internal gathered pockets and two external zip pockets. The external zip pockets are great for slipping in your cell phone or baby's pacifier or other small items you want on hand. There's also one more internal zip pocket, which I might starry using for her change of clothes, but we'll see.Exterior is nice looking and subtle. As much as I admire some of the whimsical and fun picklebottom and jujube patterns, a lot of them scream diaper bag (admittedly, many of theirs don't, but none of them had this rucksack kind of look). It really reminds me of a bag I loved in college, so maybe this has a nostalgia factor me as well. If it holds up through the diaper bag years, I can see myself converting this to a casual on the go bag.This is perfect size for me. It's dimensions are bigger than the Brighton backpack I was using based on online published measurements for both, but feels smaller in that I don't feel like I'm carrying around a giant picnic basket on my back like I did. The interior seems similar size but my perception may be different than others, ymmv. Same goes for the picklebottom boxy I was going to get before I saw this- with its soft sides, it seems more usable for me than the rectangular interior of the boxy- again, your mileage may vary, some people might prefer that interior.I could see this being a ""dig around to find the lost item"" sometimes, but so are most of the diaper bags I've looked at if you're not careful- just because of its wide mouth and soft structure. I like having it wide open like this so I can use a diaper clutch for the essentials, then my wallet, a small laundry bag with a couple onesies in it, and a few burp cloths or swaddling blanket, and the pockets for items like bottles and such. It does have a lighter colored interior so should be able to see things in contrast, though.  The included changing pad folds nicely to cit into one of the gathered pockets. Haven't used the included insulated bottle bag yet, so don't know how long its good to use yet.Have already used this bag a couple times and liked the backpack straps more in usage than I have with some other backpack diaper bags. These don't cut into my shoulders as much as they did (what is it with diaper bag backpacks having narrow, seatbelt-like material? So uncomfortable!). These are padded faux leather. You can also strap them down and away with velcro when using the messenger bag style strap. That strap has been useful with its provided velcro stroller straps, but I use the backpack option more, so I just use my jj cole stroller straps on the hooks instead.Will try to add more thoughts as time goes by and good/bad experiences happen",4,1
"Baby Boom MVP Nap Mat, Blue",just got to get my grandson to sleep in it. It has a little pillow attached to it and fits perfect everywhere we go.,4,1
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Window Valance, Little Traveler",This is the perfect addition to an airplane themed bedroom for a little boy. We combined it with an old fashioned airplane bed set and the set up is beautiful.,5,1
Charlie Banana Washable Hanging Diaper Pail (Turquoise),"So there is this misconception, that keeping cloth diapers all sealed shut will keep us from smells.  Not so....  Urine itself along with fabric fibers especially non natural ones like polyesters, will put an ammonia smell out like you can't imagine. The older the kids get the stronger the smell.  And you don't even need to wait more than a day for ths to happen....  So the more I tried to suffocate the smell, the worse it became.  Frustrated, I was tipped off by the science explanation of it which made perfect sense and decided to try it.  I would try to paraphrase it all, but I'm sure it wouldn't come out right, so just trust me.  Anyway, open air method causes the diapers to not marinate so to speak.  By sealing them, we are essentially steam cooking our diapers in the natural acid.  By leaving them open the air keeps that from happening.  Just to experiment, I tried a few for almost a week.  Even by that time still no smell.  If you put your nse right up to it, maybe you could get barely a whiff.  If you are still concerned tho, there is a swatch of terry cloth attached inside that you can use tea tree oil or any other oil as a neutralizer.  The only thing I find comical is that this bag and the Fuzzi Bunz bag are exactly and I mean exactly the same.  The difference, fuzzi bunz is in th US with great customer service while Charlie Banana is in China and difficult to reach.  Both function the same, just more color options here...  This is the perfect solution for a cloth diaper pail.  Keep n mind that those of you who soak, dunk or completely rinse vs. spray off you will most likely get leaking at the bottom with the zipper.  The zipper is made for quick dumping into the laundry.  Personally I don't use it because I'd rather push the diapers inside out and have the bag wash inside out as well.  If you do soak and dunk, I would recommend a thick towel at the bottom to cover the zipper and deter leaks.",5,1
Avent BPA Free Soothie Pacifier 6 Pack - Blue- 3 Months and Older - 3m+ (was 6 to 18 Months),"Our daughter has used this style since she was born and really likes it. This 6 pack is perfect now that she's gotten a little older. We plan on weening her off when she gets around 1 like we did with our first. Until then, these are our number one choice",5,1
"DaVinci Emily Changing Table II, White","This is a very simple changing table. It did not take too long to put together at all. The pad that comes with it is quite thin, though, and we bought a different one instead. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but there is plenty of room for storage baskets on the shelves so everything will be close at hand. We got the same style crib and it matches perfectly.",4,1
Maymom Tubing Set For Medela Freestyle Breastpump,Was really pissed when the original medela tubing cracked and died in my pump and medela won't sell just the tubing. This was the perfect alternative and works perfectly for my pump.,5,1
BOBA Organic Classic Baby Carrier 3G- Chestnut,"Its amazing. I wore my second babe in a wrap (Didymos, also amazing) and this every day for the first three months of his life. He was a bit discontented about being on this side of things and was only happy and not crying when close to the momma. This saved by back, shoulders, and kept me handsfree to tend to my other wee one.  I loved that you could easily change the strapping to accommodate a newborn without having to buy any extra inserts. The wraps are sometimes cumbersome when out and about (i.e dragging all over the dirty parking lot as I whip and wind the sucker snug) so this was an easy go to for shopping trips and such. My LO is now six months old and is still very happy being worn in this. I have an Ergo performance too (which I also love) but choose this one daily for two main reasons. He's teething something fierce and mouthing everything. These padded organic cotton straps are a worry-free teething surface and extra soft on his little gums. Secondly, the very dimensions on this carrier carry him more comfortably than the Ergo. It's taller and more narrow across. His legs aren't in an awkwardly wide frogger position in this as they are in the Ergo and the soft top on this one comes to a perfectly comfortable mid-head height. The Ergo hits him right at his neck and rubs. I'm not dogging the Ergo by any means. For a bigger/older baby its amazing and I will definitely be using it again as he grows in to it.",5,1
"Boba Air Baby Carrier, Black","This is an awesome carrier that hardley takes up space. About the size of a small bag of chips. We use this for our 16 month old daughter that weighs 22lbs. Not the most comfortable thing for the shoulders but it's designed to be lightweight not super comfortable. I wouldn't say it's uncomfortable, just not perfect. We love it.",5,1
Disposable Baby Bibs 24 Count (4 bibs per package) - by Mighty Clean Baby,These bibs were exactly as described. The sticky tabs behind the neck are probably a bit too sticky - my daughter's hair got caught while using the sticky tabs and quite a few hair came off as she was squirming. We used these on a family vacation and it served the purpose perfectly!,5,1
Graco SnugRider Elite Stroller &amp; Car Seat Carrier,We had purchased the snap-and-go from a local retailer in order to quickly attach our Snugride 35 to a stroller. While it did kind of &#34;attach&#34; it was really just sitting on two loose straps for support underneath and another on top for locking it down (still seemed more than a bit unstable). After fiddling with the straps every time we put the car seat with the snap-and-go in we decided we wanted something we can actually &#34;snap in and go&#34; with. While the SnugRider elite is a little pricey (minus 1 star) it does the job perfectly and holds the snugride 35 securely. Don't waste your time with the cheaper imitation...,4,1
Graco SnugRider Elite Stroller &amp; Car Seat Carrier,lightweight and easy to fold with one one hand. perfect for my needs of in and out of the car for quick errands.,5,1
Graco SnugRider Elite Stroller &amp; Car Seat Carrier,This is great!!  It really is easy to open and close and maneuvers extremely well.  I highly recommend this for quick trips or trips when convenience is needed and you don't want to pull out the regular size stroller.  I have a Graco SnugRide carseat from 2011 and it fits perfectly.,5,1
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, Blue",These are very soft and fit the Graco playard perfectly.  I was a little worried as I couldn't find a soft sheet to fit the playard. This is exactly what I've been looking for.,5,1
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, Blue",Not an exact match to our Pack&Play--but; a little stretching never hurt anybody. The jersey knit is perfect & we LOVE having baby in our room without having her ginormous crib in there too.Great purchase!,5,1
"Snuza Baby Monitor, Hero","I purchased this little monitor for my new born grand daughter. Her mom has been using it for several weeks now and it works perfectly. If you are the parent of a new baby then you have anxiously hovered over that baby while it is sleeping trying to determine whether or not the child is still breathing. Well, with this little gadget you can see at a glance that the child is fine. It has a little light that blinks with each breath. The light can be easily seen through at least two layers of clothes and a swaddle blanket. During the daylight hours when a light is more difficult to see, another feature offers a little beep that can be heard (this can be turned off). So, if the baby is blinking( or beeping) it is breathing. My daughter loves this feature as the first several weeks the baby slept in mom's room close to her bed. It was comforting for mom to be able to just glance over and see the light blinking. Now that the child is in her own room mom can just glance into the room to check her.We have not had any false alarms. I've read reviews that stated the baby's diaper has to be extremely tight for this monitor to work properly, but we have not found that to be the case. We diaper the child snugly as we normally would to prevent leaks. The monitor clips easily and securely over the edge of the diaper. It's very simple to operate. Its compact enough that once your child starts to roll over it won't interfere with the baby's comfort.We tested it on a stuffed animal and the vibrating feature and alarm worked just as they should. If your child is sleeping in another room I would recommend using a baby monitor so that you would be able to hear the alarm if it did go off, especially if the child's room is some distance from your own. The alarm is loud enough to hear if you are in the same room or nearby, but obviously, it is not as loud as a smoke detector. It's not going to wake the entire household.Over all, I am very happy with this monitor. I've read a good deal of information about SIDS and SUIDS, the experts claim alarms have not been found to reduce the incidence of sudden infant death, but I bought the alarm anyway. I felt that god forbid something did happen, and the baby stopped breathing, an intervention after just 15 seconds could avert a tragedy, whereby a delay of possibly several hours would be devastating.",5,1
Combi Cosmo Ex Stroller - Flagstone,"perfect stroller for what i need. what i needed:one hand foldliftable with one hand and baby in the otherlightweight (WEIGHS 13 LBS!!)full recline/comfortable for babystylish designenclosed...high up off the ground (just because...farther off the ground, the better, right? also, i like that when baby sits in the stroller, the sides ""enclose"" baby...so that they're not just sitting on a seat, all exposed)for the money , which is very very reasonable compared to others, it offers all of the features you need from a full sized stroller, but has the convenience and portability of an umbrella (well, almost..)It also has a sleek, euro look , which i like. its narrow enough to maneuver in stores, public places.I meticulously looked high and low for strollers, and really, could have spent up to $500  if i had to...but save your money for something else. This stroller has it all for 1/5th of that.If you're a single Mom, living in the city/urban area, may have to take the stroller on bus/or subway, and dont have an SUV or $$$$, but want something ""cool"", not Walmart trashy, this stroller is for you. You can use it from birth to toddler years too! its awesome. love it.PS I have a 17 year old too...i had one for HER! bought one in 96---used it until she was about 3 or so....it held up and was perfect.

"Kids Preferred Melamine Feeding Set, The World of Beatrix Potter","Adorable set for any child! I look forward to seeing my daughter use it. Perfect for anyone who loves Peter Rabbit and any Beatrix Potter products. We have not used it yet, because my baby is'nt ready for solids yet, but we wanted something special for her and this was it. Her nickname is Bunny, so we look for Peter Rabbit things for her... We are very happy with this set.",5,1
"Peg Perego Viaggio HBB 120, Crystal Beige","Having switched from a better known booster to this one I have to say I am impressed.  First, I like the color scheme as it matches the interior of my car very well.  Also, my 4 year old claims that it is much more comfortable than her last one.  It also has a better skid surface so the seat does not slide around without a seat protector on the leather seats.  It seems very sturdy and the weight range is perfect to be the last booster seat we will need for her.",4,1

Puj Flyte - Compact Infant Bath (White),"We have a small home lacking storage so I was searching high and low for a compact bath solution for my newborn. This is perfection!

Kids Travel Organizer BLACK,This handy organizer helped me get all the kid stuff in the back seat under control.  The size is perfect to fit between the 2 convertible car seats in the 3rd row in our minivan.  I considered the larger size but was happy I got this one because this needed to fit between 2 car seats.The kids in each seat on either side can now easily reach the books or other toys they'd like to look at while we're on the road.  The 2 cup holders in the front are a great extra spot to hold extra snack cups or water bottles while kids are moving around - although they can't reach them while they are strapped in their car seats.,5,1
Luxe Baby Crib Comforter - Soft Pink,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter to have an extra blanket/comforter.  It's the perfect size; she's very tall but still in a toddler bed, so it covers her feet without excess fabric.  It's soft, fluffy and warm.  It went through the washer and dryer the first time without pilling or wrinkling excessively.  Also, the pink is much deeper, or more pink, than the picture, but it's still very pretty.  I recommend this comforter.",5,1

Born Free Tru-Temp Bottle Warming System,"If you have a baby, you need this bottle warmer. It's so easy to use, and it heats the bottle perfect every time. You just choose whether the bottle is room temperature or cold, dial up how many ounces are in the bottle, and hit start. The instructions state this, but it bears repeating: Only use the cold setting if the whole bottle was in the refrigerator, and the glass is cold as well as the milk. If just the milk is cold, use the room temperature setting. By the time you get the baby and change him, the bottle is ready. I love this warmer! I haven't had to use the storage area in the back, so I can't comment on that.",5,1
Born Free Tru-Temp Bottle Warming System,"I have twins and it takes forever to heat up bottles with the other products..ie Dr. Brown ect. but this thing heats up to perfect temps in half the time, and cost just a tad more and sometimes cheaper than other less efficient brands. So far I highly recommend, although I cant speak for durability as I have only used it for about a week.",5,1
Born Free Tru-Temp Bottle Warming System,"When we first got this product we thought it was the greatest thing ever. As first time parents we were nervous about making bottles the right temperature and this totally solved that. Perfect temp every time. Easy to use. Well designed.This is a very good product but once we got used to feeding the baby and the nervousness wore off, our use of this warmer slowed down. It takes some time to heat up the bottle. Just a couple of minutes which might not seem like much but when your baby is going bezerk it is an eternity and we ended up running water to the correct temp and making the bottle on the fly.We still use the warmer, but not when rushed. This is a nice to have but if your baby budget is tight, your dollars can be better invested else where.",4,1
Baby Trend Universal Double Snap-N-Go Stroller Frame,"I live in South Africa and the Baby Trend Snap 'n Go stroller is not available here.  There is nothing else available that is small and easily manouverable here either.  And seeing as I have a toddler already I knew not to spend too much money on a fancy pram seeing as when she outgrew her snug and safe I bought a. Lightweight stroller, never to use the pram again.  So I find the snap and go stroller for my twins is perfect.  As soon as they outgrow the snug and safe car seats and are allowed to sit in front facing car seats, I will buy a lightweight side by side stroller that can fit through a standard door.  The snap and go is lightweight, quick and easy to fold and unfold, and I bought two maxi cosi car seats to go with it.  It fits perfectly.  And if my toddler gets tired, the storage basket underneath has plenty of space for her to sleep in.  Brilliant product.",5,1

SOHO Giraffe Diaper Bag 3 in 1 with changing pad &amp; Bottle case (Black),"I love the pattern of this bag. It perfect size, not too big or small and the material holds up great. It does not have the cheap fabric feel that you find other diaper bags having. The pockets on the side are wonderful for little things to carry and the big inside side pocket is perfect for extra clothes or whatever you need to put in it. I like that it has an outside pocket also. I put my wallet and keys in it do I don't have to worry about digging for them later. I would recommend this bag to anyone.",5,1
SOHO Giraffe Diaper Bag 3 in 1 with changing pad &amp; Bottle case (Black),Great large diaper bag! It was diffidently larger than expected which was perfect! The print and material of it was of great quality! The only bad thing was that the long strap had a bit of the material sticking out from the weaving so I had to cut that off.,4,1
Printed Coral Changing Table Cover Blue,"I ordered this for my son, and it was adorable! It came in and fit my changing pad perfectly. It's very soft too!Love it!!!",4,1
Gerber Organic Birdseye Prefold Cloth Diaper - White,"I buy these as burp rags and they are by far the best out there. They are extremely soft and get a nice bubbly texture to them, and get softer and softer with each wash. There are no thick seamed edges or hard corners. They fit perfectly over the shoulder, fold up small to go anywhere, and are very soft to use on baby.I dont cloth diaper, so for me I think these would actually do better marketed as burp cloths. I think for actual diapers they might be thin and the weave too loose. However the softness would also make them more stretchy as a result, allowing for a snug yet comfortable fit if you were to use them as diapers.My last bunch of these are still going strong and have been washed probably a thousand times and used for just about any household task. Now with a new baby on the way I have purchased three more fresh packs. You will truly get your moneys worth on these, no matter what you use them for.",5,1

"Infantino Pop &amp; Play 3 Count Activity Pods, Jungle","This toy works perfectly for my little guy's pop and play overhead gym.  He can sit in front and reach them easily and they are interesting to him.  plus they are unisex so if we end up with a daughter she can play too.  The sounds that the lion makes cannot be turned off or volume controlled,  but in my opinion it is not too loud to be annoying and hasn't been a problem like some noise making toys.  We love this set!",5,1

Ginsey Disney Princess 2-Step Stool,"I love the height and that it is 2 steps. It doesn't move when LO is trying to get onto the stool and she quickly learned how to step up. She can now reach the sink with no problem (with faucet extender) to wash hands. Will use for potty training as well. Looked everywhere for a low cost stool with steps, and this fit perfectly.",5,1

"Skip Hop Grand Central Diaper Bag, Black","I was carting my baby, and all his daycare essentials -- which includes a day's worth of cloth diapers -- on the train to work/daycare each day.  In other words, I needed a BIG diaper bag.  I had the skip hop via messenger which was WAY too small, and so many other diaper bags look silly, with stupid, cutesy patterns that scream &#34;diaper bag.&#34;  So I was using a big reusable grocery bag, but that was annoying because everything was just thrown together inside with no organization.I finally stumbled upon this bag and it has worked perfectly.  It fits an amazing amount of stuff inside -- I've even used it for weekends away -- without looking like I'm some crazy bag lady.My only complaints include:1.  the via messenger has a pocket specifically for soiled clothes/diapers; there is no logical spot for them in this bag.  I always have a wet bag with me so it's NBD, just the control freak in me likes to have a spot for everything!2.  I wish the bottle pockets zipped or velcroed closed -- I am not sure what good the &#34;insulation&#34; does when the top is wide open.3.  I've had this bag for about a month, with daily use on public transit, and so far it's held up well.  However, my via messenger did not hold up so well, with tearing fabric and fraying ends.  So, I don't know if this is a problem for Skip Hop bags in general, but perhaps something to keep in mind.Overall though, if you are looking for a roomy diaper bag, this one is great!",5,1
Gerber Graduates Kiddy Cutlery 3 Piece Fork Set,I love these forks and so does my one year old.  They are a perfect size for him to hold and they can actually stab food.,5,1
Gerber Graduates Kiddy Cutlery 3 Piece Fork Set,"These forks are so well-made and fit in our 2-year-old's hands perfectly. They are not sharp, but she is still able to pick up whatever she needs to.",5,1
"Joovy Caboose Too Rear Seat, Greenie","If you have a new baby and a toddler under 3 yo. Do yourself a favor and order the rear seat when you order the stroller. First time I used it, life was perfect. My toddler was knocked out in the seat. I am giving this product 4 stars because I do wish this seat came with some kind of headrest. I have a very tall 2 yo.",4,1
"Luvable Friends Geometric Print Fitted Knit Crib Sheet, Blue","I love these sheets because they are soft and the colors are perfect for my baby's room, but they are a bit thin. One already has a small hole and she's only 2 months old. They are so cheap though that I bought 3 so it doesn't bother me too much.",4,1
"Clevamama ClevaFoam Baby Pillow, Cream","I bought this pillow because i noticed my baby likes to be elevated when sleeping, and it is perfect! The first night he laid on it, he fell asleep immediately and slept through the night, not sure if it is the pillow or what but he seems very comfortable on it and he never slept as good before, it's perfect size, nice comfy foam. I would highly recommend.",5,1
"Nat and Jules Jesus Loves Me Musical Plush Lamb with Blanket, Pink",This lamb was purchased to decorate my grandson's door wreath and it was PERFECT!!  Such a sweet face and precious blanket!,5,1
North States Deluxe Decor Gate,We were having trouble blocking our staircase from the bottom due to the wall configurations around that area...this gate was the perfect answer. I love that it shuts behind you and that it detaches from the wall on both sides...no worries if we need to take something large through that area. This gate has brought me a lot of peace of mind knowing my little one is safe from the bottom of the stairs.,5,1
Satin Laced Bib,"Arrived on time, packaged well. I used this bib for my daughters christening and it matched the dress perfectly. Only thing I suggest is velcro or a snap closure instead of tie.",5,1
"Ju-Ju-Be Hobo Be Diaper Bag, Dreamy Diamonds","I am in love with my new HoboBe!  It has all of the features and organization I was looking for in a ""mom bag,"" and is absolutely gorgeous.  It is a fairly small diaper bag, so I wouldn't recommend it for a mom with a newborn, or multiple children in diapers.  But as a purse or toddler bag, it is perfection!  There are a ton of pockets, my favorite being the soft, cell phone pocket in the front.  The bag is washable, which is great, and the fabric seems very durable.  This bag is beautiful, and doesnt look diapery at all.  Highly recommend!",5,1
"Ju-Ju-Be Hobo Be Diaper Bag, Dreamy Diamonds","I expected this bag to be about the same size as the purse I'd been using, but it's actually a little smaller. I was disappointed at first, and nervous about how it would be able to hold enough for my three kids plus the newborn I'll be having soon. But, I took it to the zoo and had enough room for my things (wallet, keys, phone, lip balm, gum, etc.) and for a couple of pair of training pants, a few diapers, a travel pack of wipes, sippy cups and snack cups for all three kids. Since we don't normally go on all day outings I'm sure this bag will be plenty big enough. I actually like that it's smaller than what I'm used to because it is much lighter. If it had more room I'd just end up overpacking. This is perfect for me and holds enough for all of my kids.",5,1
"Ju-Ju-Be Hobo Be Diaper Bag, Dreamy Diamonds",This bag is the perfect size if you have an older toddler and don't need to carry as much as you did with a baby.  I do bring a bigger bag on the rare occasions where we are gone all day or I know I won't be able to get to the &#34;emergency&#34; diapers I stash in the car.It lost a star because I don't like the strap it comes with -- it just isn't long enough.  I replaced it with a teal seat belt strap which makes the bag just about perfect.,4,1
Wimmer Ferguson Wimmer Infant Stim Mobile To Go,"The cards feel like a strong, reinforced card stock. You can swap the cards around to change the &#34;view&#34; for your child. I think my favorite thing about this mobile is that it folds up to a nice compact size for storage. It's very lightweight and easy to attach to a stroller or infant carseat. This is designed for children 0-5 months and contains images that have been shown to be developmentally stimulating for young children. The clamp attachment was easy to attach and remove (I don't like to leave anything attached to the car seat while I'm driving). When not in use, it's very simple to toss it in a ziploc bag and put it in a diaper bag. I don't think it would hold up to heavy duty grabbing or yanking, but it's perfect for young infants .",5,1
Nuk Newborn Orthodontic Disposable Nipples (25pk),"This is perfect for slow flow. This is also made in Germany, not China, like many of baby products on the market today. These are also disposable after 2 months",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Straw Bottle, Ladybug, 12 Ounce","This goes perfectly with the melamine owl plate I ordered for my granddaughter, she loves them both!  They would make a great gift for a baby or toddler.",5,1
"Nuk Soft Pack of 8 Soft OrthoStar Pacifier, Blue/Green, Size 1","This is the only pacifier that is perfect! Why?1)It is truly only one piece of silcone so it's more sanitary and doesnt trap water or dirtiness in crevices . And is safer. Others say they are one piece but actually plastic is wrapped around by silcone, and can come apart2)It has the Natural shape nipple -- mimics mom's nipple3)the shield is curved so it fits comfortable on the baby's face and helps it not fall out.Soothie and gum drops DO NOT have all these three features!!",5,1
"Nuk Soft Pack of 8 Soft OrthoStar Pacifier, Blue/Green, Size 1","Perfect shape, and I love that they are one piece so that water/soap doesn't get into the crevices between parts.",5,1
"Skip Hop Moby Bathtub Elbow Rest, Blue","My daughter has a toddler and is expecting baby #2 any day. Bathing a little one is hard enough in a tub, but when you have a shower door, you also have a metal rail to lean over.This device works perfectly to pad that rail so she can lean over the tub. Great product!",5,1
"Comotomo Silicone Baby Teether, Blue","My one year has never been an oral child- no binkies, thumbs, what-have-you, but when he started getting his eye-teeth (I think that's what they're called) he had to put everything in his mouth, trying to find some relief. I bought this in desperation, but I didn't have really high hopes. We were both pleasantly surprised by the size of the legs on this- the perfect, exact size of his little fingers, which had been his go-to chewing object when his teeth were really bugging him. He could fit 2 legs in his mouth at a time and hit both sore spots on each side at the same time, which his fingers couldn't do. He carried this around for a few months until those teeth finally broke though. It was a life-saver!",5,1
"Comotomo Silicone Baby Teether, Blue","This Teether is a great size, and the shape is really well thought out. Unlike rings, where tiny babies have a hard time getting the ring in their mouth just the right way to chew, as long as this is near their mouth, it's easy to get some part in. And the little &#34;fingers&#34; of the toy are similar to actual fingers - which we all know babies love.My only complaint is that our little guy prefers more texture. This toy is almost completely smooth, with jus a little bit of texture at the tip of each &#34;finger&#34;. We bought this at the same time as the Lifefactory Multi Sensory Silicone Teether and our baby definitely prefers the Lifefactory one. It has several large textured areas.In my opinion, adding more texture to this little guy would make it perfect! But as it is, I would go for the Lifefactory Teether instead.",4,1
"Comotomo Silicone Baby Teether, Blue",We have bought many teething toys for our daughter and this one is her absolute favorite!  It fits in her hands perfectly and she can grab the ring easily. She likes the 4 arms because they are the perfect size for for little mouth!,5,1
Grovia Mini Magic Stick,"This is not a cream, more like a salve, applies easily & with no mess on your hands, and jeeps our baby's bum rash free (except when he gets diarrhea, then only Triple Paste and disposables will do).  This has NEVER clogged any of our BumGenius, Flip, or other cloth diapers.  Easy, simple to use, works.  A perfect combo for us!!",5,1
"Itzy Ritzy Lunch Happened Bento Lunch Box, Rock Star","my daughter loves it !!!! i actually thought it was bigger, and was disappointed at first, but when i started using it, i realized it was just the perfect size.",5,1
Rabbit In Hat Pinata (each),This was super cute. Really looks as picture shows. Perfect for little kids and magic theme parties. Would recommend to anyone,5,1
Chicco KeyFit 30 Magic Infant Car Seat - Rattania,Im so glad we spent the extra money and bought this car seat. I love it! My baby is so comfortable in it. Shes 9 months old now and still sits comfortably in it. It is very easy to clean and adjust as baby gets bigger. It is easy to carry and easy to put in/out of the car seat base. It fits perfectly into our BOB stroller with the Chicco car seat adapter. You wont regret spending the extra money and buying this car seat! We wanted our baby to be safe and comfortable and this seemed like the best choice.,5,1
myBaby SoundSpa Portable,This is perfect for baby white noise. It gets plenty loud enough and the price is great. Variety of sounds is nice too.,5,1
"Summer Infant Deluxe Piddle Pad, Black, 2 Pack",Great..fits perfect..Highly recommend! Especially when going out and about while potty training..I would think a smart buy for infants too.,5,1
Sock Ons Clever Little Things That Keep Baby Socks On! 3 Pack Girls 0 - 6 Months,"Our (now 3mo) daughter was always very petite & still can't keep 0-3mo socks on.  My mother-in-law found these & ordered two pairs as a Christmas gift.  They work perfect! Her socks stay on through playtime, nap, you name it.  The package states to remove during nap time, but I always left them on (monitored of course).  They're not tight as I checked to make sure after she wore them for several hours & no signs of skin markings or discoloration.  If your baby has small feet or trouble keeping socks on, then order a pair of these! You won't be dissapointed!",5,1
Bumbleride Indie Stroller - Aquamarine,"This stroller is exactly what it claimed to be. It's just what we were looking for. Our granddaughter has not yet arrived, but we are confident that this stroller will be perfect for her.",5,1
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Changing Pad Cover, Liam The Brave - Medallions","Very soft, fits perfectly, and an adorable pattern that perfectly matches the nursery! What more can I say? Love aden + anais products!",5,1
"Carter's Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Lily Pad Frog","Bought these for my daughter who is 2 months into motherhood.  She couldn't believe how easy these made her life. She had been given some of a lesser quality, rubber backed terry cloth that were very small. The Carter's are soft against her baby's skin and and the edges stay flat after washing many times. The large size makes them perfect! Yea!",5,1
Nuby Splash 'n Catch Bath Time Fishing Set,It is a perfect bath time toy. It is just right for my one year old. She loves playing with it at bath time.,5,1
Baby Buddy &quot;Size-It&quot; Closet Organizers - SAGE (10 count),"This is perfect for anyone with a baby to help organize clothes hanging in the closet.  I had been keeping the hangers from the store with the size markings on them to help me find the right size, but these organizers are easier to see and make the closet look much better.  (I have now switched all hangers to the same white hangers rather than keeping any from the store.)  One reviewer had said that the stickers are hard to read.  I do not find this to be true, but I also have good lighting to see in the closet.  I plan to use these with future children, so I bought sage since it is a neutral color.  In order to use all the sizing stickers provided (without peeling off smaller sizes to reuse the same organizers), you will actually need 3 of the 5-ct packs.  I plan to buy another pack to use all of the stickers up to size 8, since I will probably need to use the smaller sizes with future children at the same time as the bigger sizes with my son.",5,1
"Graco Pack 'n Play Quilted Playard Sheet, Light Blue",I like that it is quilted for a little extra padding for my baby.  Perfect size; did not shrink too much in the wash.,4,1
mybaby HoMedics SoundSpa On-The-Go,"We love, love, love this item.  I ordered this because I saw it in a kids magazine and thought it would be good for travel.  It is perfect!  It can hook onto your diaper bag and go everywhere with you!  There are volume controls and lots of sound choices.  It has really helped to get my daughter to sleep in the car.  It has continuous play or you could set a timer.  My daughter loves to turn it on and change the sounds herself( 9 mons when we bought it... But we'd had it earlier!). We love this item so much that I ordered one for each of my pregnant friends.  Amazon has the best price by far!",5,1
mybaby HoMedics SoundSpa On-The-Go,I cannot be without this product! It is nice and small but plenty of sound. I use the wave/ocean sound but the white noise works just as well. The song/music is a bit annoying to fall asleep to but for some it may be perfect. There are multiple sound levels with speakers on both sides of the device. You can also choose to have it turn off after 15 min. I use this every night with my little one! Would recommend!,5,1
"Simple Wishes D Lite Hands Free Breastpump Bra, Soft Pink, Large to Plus Size","I order this bra because I am exclusively pumping so I needed to be able to do it hands free so I could try to multi-task.1. The sizing chart is off. I have a 38&#34; ribcage and 42.5&#34; bust (38DD) According to the size chart I should be able to wear an XS-L without much issue. When I got the bra and tried it on I had to have the velcro extender to the very edge and it was still uncomfortably tight when I pumped. After one pump session I returned the bra and ordered the XL-XXL. It fits perfectly. I have plenty of space to either extend or shrink the bra.2. Since I am exclusively pumping, this bra gets a work out. I pump 20min/session, 5 sessions/day. I wash the bra once a week in the washing machine with cold water on a normal cycle. I do not put it in the dryer to dry. The writing on the inside is getting worn off but the bra itself is still in excellent condition. The elastic that holds the flanges is still tight.I really love this bra. It made pumping so much easier.",4,1
"Modern Littles Bold Folding Laundry Basket, Solid Blue","Got these for the kids rooms and they are perfect.  Great size, great color!  Also got the orange Giraffe one and it is adorable for a girls room.(PS. it is yellow, not orange)",5,1
Dishwasher Proof Baby Bottle Labels with Protective Name Laminate,I order these in July and have been using then for the past 6 months.  They were easy to apply to bottles and I have not had to replace them yet or reapply.  The bottles go through the dishwasher almost everyday and the labels continue to stay on the bottles.  These have been perfect for daycare!,5,1
"Halo Early Walker SleepSack Wearable Blanket Micro-Fleece, Baby Blue / Cream, X-Large, 2-Pack","I can't say enough positive things about this. My son is 18 months, and is 32 in. It fits him with room to grow a little. We originally got him a 2t, and it was massive! This fits perfect, with room :)",5,1
"Mother's Lounge Carseat Canopy, Maddox",Love it- perfect weight so that it doesn't blow with the wind. It's adorable and I want it in more colors- but it!,5,1
"The New Amazing Spiderman Lunch Set (Water Bottle, Snack Container and Sandwich Container)",My 3 year old brother loves this set! I bought it to go withB000UK1PYAand everything fits perfectly in it and he can not eat lunch or snack without the complete spiderman set. It seems pretty durable. He has had it for a month and it is still going strong considering he uses the food containers 5 days a week and the water bottle 7 days a week.,5,1
"Sealy Waterproof Crib Mattress Pad, 2-Pack",Great price for this item and it shipped fast. Fits the mattress perfect. washes up really nice. Glad i ordered it for my daughter.,4,1
Hello Kitty Children's All Purpose First Aid Kit,It's perfect for my daughter. The band-aids stick really well. There are also two free re-fills that come with it.,5,1
Tie Necktie Dots Month Stickers for Bodysuit Boy #66,I love these Monthly Necktie Stickers. They arrived just in time and are perfect for the first year photos / memories,5,1
"The Grandparent Gift Plaque, Grandparents of Twins","I have never seen a sign with the words this one has.  It was so perfect because his daughter just delivered twins.  Grandma's pretty excited too.  Since the babies and Mom were getting all the gifts, I wanted something for the grandparents and this plaque is perfect.  You can hang it on the wall or it has an extra piece of wood and so you can stand it up if you prefer.  It is well made.  They were so surprised that they were getting a gift and they absolutely love it.  Thanks!!!!",5,1
"BOB Handlebar Console, Duallie",Fits perfectly and nice to have! Great for 2 cup holders and a place for keys for the Double BOB.,5,1
Carter's Zip Front Fashion Tote Diaper Bag (Brown),"I bought this diaper bag right after baby #5 was born.  Seems crazy to get a new bag for the last baby, but honestly, I've been trying to fit all my baby/toddler stuff into smaller bags for years and it's just not worth the struggle.  I love this bag.  The outside pockets are very handy, I probably use those most often.  The inside is very roomy.  I have a &#34;diaper clutch&#34; (that holds 3-4 diapers, a travel sized wipes case, and unfolds to act as a changing mat) that fits nicely to one side, which leaves room for various toys, burp cloths, my wallet and personal items (chapstick, lotion, lip gloss, etc.)  I don't use bottles, so I unstitched one of the bottle pockets to make it into one very large pocket.  Better storage for burp cloths or baby blanket.  The outside pockets are perfect for a water bottle or to store tissues or toys for quick retrieval.  It is big, but when you've got a baby plus several other kids, you need something big.I love that's it's stylish and doesn't scream DIAPER BAG.  I can see myself using this even after I don't need a diaper bag anymore.  It would be a perfect &#34;mom&#34; bag to fit all my mom stuff (wallet, phone, book, lunch, personal items, water bottle, extra kids stuff ... you know, everything but the kitchen sink!)I've had it for 4 months now and have enjoyed it. So far it holds up well and is what I expected.  I think it's a good bag for the price.  I would recommend it.",4,1
"Mod Swad Le Sac Bamboo &amp; Thermal Wearable Blanket (Large 20-25 lbs, Metro)","I love the softness of this swaddle! My husband thinks that the band is too tight on her, but I think its perfect because it makes her feel cuddled. The only thing I don't like is that its hard to take off if she happens to wake in the middle of the night for a diaper change.",4,1
The Diaper One N Done,"I wish I would have gotten this sooner. We bought a diaper genie and after 2 weeks of smelling nasty diapers all the time and almost passing out when it came time to change it, this product is a breath of fresh air.... Literally! No more radom bags under my sink. Its the perfect size and easy to use.",5,1
Baby Brezza Prima Storage System: Quattro,Each individual storage holds 2.7 ounces. My 7 1/2 month old isn't a big eater yet. So with this size no homemade food goes to waste. It is easy to pour the food in and out.These are the perfect size. They are stackable and also the cap turns and you spin it to the day of the week you made the food.  Love these!,5,1
Simple Snug Pocket Diaper (Orange),I've been using smart snugs diapers for over a year now and they have held up really well for me and have saved us so much money!  I would definitely recommend this product.  I use rockin green on them for pre-soaking/washing.  Then place them in our wet pail until wash time and hang them to dry!  They come out perfect every time!  I have never had the diaper itself leak on me and have had far less 'exploders' with these than any other diapers.  As my baby I grew I did start using two reusable inserts in the pocket to soak up more liquid and prevent any leaks especially through the night.  I hope this helps!,5,1
&quot;A Little Pillow Company&quot; Hypoallergenic TODDLER PILLOW in White - 13&quot;x18&quot; (Ages 2 - 4),Just what I've been looking for!  Perfect size for my 1 year old granddaughter...Not found in storesDon't hesitate ordering..Won't be disappointed,5,1
&quot;A Little Pillow Company&quot; Hypoallergenic TODDLER PILLOW in White - 13&quot;x18&quot; (Ages 2 - 4),"This pillow is perfect size for small cubby in Preschool! When ordering a pillowcase, pay attention to a measurements! This pillow has plenty of support for little heads, but could be perfect for traveling pillow too!",5,1
&quot;A Little Pillow Company&quot; Hypoallergenic TODDLER PILLOW in White - 13&quot;x18&quot; (Ages 2 - 4),"We got this pillow for our 19-month old and she just loves it.  It's the perfect size for her without being too thick.  We feel very comfortable with her sleeping on this pillow.  And I just love the fact that it's hypoallergenic and machine washable.  My daughter loves is so much, she insisted on sleeping with it before I even found a pillow case for it.",5,1
&quot;A Little Pillow Company&quot; Hypoallergenic TODDLER PILLOW in White - 13&quot;x18&quot; (Ages 2 - 4),"This was the perfect size for my 2 year old when we moved him to the big bed. Unfortunately, it became pretty lumpy after about 6 months. He still likes it though.",4,1
&quot;A Little Pillow Company&quot; Hypoallergenic TODDLER PILLOW in White - 13&quot;x18&quot; (Ages 2 - 4),"My daughter LOVES this pillow! She refused to use a regular pillow and just slept with her head on the bed until she was 18 months old. Then I got this pillow. She loves it, I love it. Perfect size, not too thick. The pillow case from Little Pillow Company is a perfect fit and feels very soft.",5,1
&quot;A Little Pillow Company&quot; Hypoallergenic TODDLER PILLOW in White - 13&quot;x18&quot; (Ages 2 - 4),"Longer than other pillows for toddlers so their heads don't roll off.  Just the perfect thickness, not too much and my grandson loves it.",5,1
Dreambaby Soft Potty Seat - Blue,"I love this seat! It is beyond easy to clean, and fits great on the toilet so there is no mess underneath when its removed. My daughter has special needs and is almost 7, even though she is small for a 7 yr. old, she is still too big for most baby/toddler seats. She fits perfect on this one. Regardless of the size or needs of your child this is a great quality product that I highly recommend.",5,1
Dreambaby Soft Potty Seat - Blue,I looked at several potty seat options and read a lot of reviews before settling on this seat for my son. It fits our oblong toilet seat perfectly and is very soft for him to sit on. The angle of the seat sits him upright enough that everything goes straight into the bowl but should he lean back the guard is more than effective. I'm so glad that I chose this seat over all of the other more costly ones on the market  :),5,1
Cuisinart BFM-1000 Baby Food Maker and Bottle Warmer,"I am incredibly happy to have run across this food maker. All I ever heard of were the brezza, beaba and baby bullet. I have friends who have each of them and they all had similar complaints.. The container was too small so they had to make several batches. When I saw the Cuisinart made 4 cups, I decided to give it a shot and I am so happy I did. Not only can I make larger batches but it is so easy and convenient.You cut up the fruit or veggies, add some water to the steamer compartment (in accordance to what you are making..there is a chart in the instructions) and turn the knob to steam. After it is done steaming you simply turn it to chop and you are all set. It is perfectly pur&eacute;ed and ready for your baby. And cleanup is a breeze as well because you only have one bowl to clean.I can't say enough amazing things about this food maker! Worth the money as it is a fabulous product.",5,1
Cuisinart BFM-1000 Baby Food Maker and Bottle Warmer,"I recently purchased this baby food maker after a lot of research about other products currently being sold. This is the only one that I have owned so I can't compare it to actual use of others.  It does exactly what it advertises it does.  The recipe book is great - you have to keep it handy to know how much water to add to each food.  The quantity it holds is perfect (usually enough for one and a half to two .75 oz freezer cube trays).  It is Cuisanart, so I feel good about the quality of the product and the fact that kitchen products are their specialty.  You have to manually switch from steam to chop, but that's not a big deal to me.  The one thing that I wish it did was beep when it was done steaming vs. just having the LED switch off.I bought 2 trays to freeze the food in after its finished with the pur&eacute;e.  I wish I had bought more because I could make several veggies in succession and then be done for the week. That's not a con to the cuisanart, that's just a lesson for me!I don't use it for the bottle warmer so I can't comment on that.",5,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Hamper, Monkey",It is the perfect size and perfect fit for what we needed. My son loves to play with it too.,4,1
"Skip Hop Zoo Hamper, Monkey",Perfect for little kids to start learning about where to put their dirty clothes before washing! Durable and easy to clean.,5,1
Tot Bots Easy Fit One-Piece Diaper 8-35 lbs (Three Little Piggies),"We have been using this diaper for about a month now on our 3.5 month old. It is one of my favorite clothies. The PUL fabric is nice and soft, as is the inside minky lining. The leg gussets are soft, but do a great job of keeping messy poops inside the diaper. The minky inside is surprisingly absorbent, we never have leaks with these (though there is plenty of space to add extra inserts if you wish). I love the aplix because it allows us to fit the diaper perfectly to our baby. And finally, it gives him a nice soft, cushy bum! Oh, and cute prints!The only thing that might be a downside for some folks is that the inner fabric is not natural. . . pretty sure it is made from polyester.",5,1
OXO Tot  12 Piece Baby Block Set,I refrigerate and freeze all of my sons food in these. They are perfect sizes and food pops out easily. Keeps everything fresh and they are easy to clean. Also they don't seem to stain. I plan on ordering more!,5,1
"Ikea 36 Pcs Kalas Kids Plastic BPA Free Flatware, Bowl, Plate, Tumbler Set, Colorful",the perfect dinnerware for toddlers.  match or mix and match.  the glasses also provide the next step up from sippy cups and straws.,5,1
Clips N Grips&reg; Child Baby Toddler Adjustable Elastic Solid Color Y Back Suspenders,"My kids just started wearing suspenders and have had a lot of trouble finding something comfortable, functional, stylish and durable. These Clips N Grips suspenders are the best I've tried so far. The clips are far superior to the half a dozen other types I've tried. This is the first suspender that DID NOT pop off my kids' pants while wearing them. I always preferred the Y back design, these suspenders are the perfect suspenders for every occasion, especially weddings. They make your children just look like little misters.",5,1
9V Auto Adapter Car Vehicle Lighter adapter for Medela Pump-in-Style Replaces Part # 67174 Retail Packaging,"Works great for travel.  I thought it would put out less suction power because of it being a car charger, but it doesn't.  Works perfectly!",5,1
Dream On Me Evenflo Baby Suite Selection 300 Firm Mattress with Square Corner,"Mattress is just as expected. It is firm by still comfortable for my son, and it fits my Evenflo portable crib perfectly without leaving gaps in the sides. I especially wanted a firm mattress because I have read of babies suffocating while sleeping face down in a soft mattress.The only reason I do not rate this item five stars is because the mattress exterior is made of plastic and is therefore non-breathable. However, this is the price to pay if you want the mattress to be waterproof and easy to clean in case the baby makes a mess. It is an unavoidable trade-in. I have seen online some mattresses that claim to be both waterproof and breathable, but have impossibly high price tags. And I still wonder if those claims are true.",4,1
Dream On Me Foam Graco Travel Lite Protable Min Play Yard Foam Mattress with Round Corner,"We got this to make the original Graco Travel Lite Crib mattress a little more comfortable for baby to take afternoon naps in the play yard conversion part and it was a great investment! The 3&#34; thickness is similar to baby's craddle, so she sleeps much more comfortably than the original 1/2&#34; hard mattress. And once we got a sheet on it, it was a perfect fit.A word of advice: Don't buy the Graco Travel Lite Crib Sheet that Amazon shows paired with the mattress. It's much too small and can't handle the 3&#34; thickness. After going through all of baby's bedding, we found a 17&#34;x31&#34; changing pad cover (like Summer Infant Ultra Plush Changing Pad Cover) works much better. It has enough stretch to cover the 19&#34; length of the mattress and is small enough to ensure a tight fit.",5,1
Dream Collection Doll Feeding Time Set with Pacifier,Goes great with a doll. Bottle doesn't drain too fast and the bib and pacifier are perfect for any new doll,5,1
Bedtime Originals Hello Kitty Ballerina 3 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"I bought this for my daughter's Stork Craft Tuscany 4-in-1 Stages Crib. The sheets fit perfectly, the ruffle was adorable, and the blanket featuring hello kitty with textures (soft furry hello kitty, with ballerina skirt) really intrigued my daughter. When I first broke out the set, she spent 20 minutes just staring at Hello Kitty's face. I was very happy with the quality, and after multiple times washing the sheets, they have no fading or signs of wear. I highly recommend this if your child (or you) loves Hello Kitty!",5,1
"Pond Friends Wiggle Bugs Nursery Art Prints (8x10&quot;, Set of Four)","We ordered the 11x14 size and they worked great above the crib in our nursery.  The colors and cute animals are perfect with our theme.  They are, however, a little pricey for printed pictures without frames, but we liked them better than anything else we'd seen.  We ordered white frames on Amazon for $11 each, so the total cost for all 4 pictures ended up being about $82.",4,1

"Safety 1st LED Nightlight, 2 Count","These are very nice night lights.  They are made well, are attractive, and suit my purpose.  The dimming/brightness feature as the room gets darker or lighter is very practical and the amount of light the nightlight produces is perfect.  I have one on the landing on my stairs and it lights up the staircase without my having to turn on a larger light.  The two-count is attractive for the pricing.  I purchased these after finding some others at Lowe's that had poor reviews.  Happy with this purchase.",5,1
Levana Lila Digital Baby Video Monitor with Night Vision and Talk to Baby Intercom 32000 (White),"Works pretty well but is VERY sensitive to sound. We have the sensitivity all the way down and a piece of sticky tack covering up the microphone on the camera, but the VOX is still triggered by a car driving by outside. Without the sticky tack, the camera picked up the fan running in baby's room. There is no option to keep the video OFF (at night, for example).That being said, I do really like the monitor. The only system we have to compare it to is the really crappy Babies R Us Perfect View that broke on us 2 months in. Given the choices in the price range, DEFINITELY buy this system over that one.",4,1

Philips Avent Double Electric Comfort Breast Pump,"I'm a mom with a 13M old baby. I've used the older model before, but I'm getting this one for my sister-in-law.I was surprised to see this on Amazon when I tried to buy the old model for my sister-in-law. Looking at the new design & description online made me curious, ""what really has changed after all these years?"" (The old model of SCF314 & 304 have been on the market for so many years!) Since this is for her first kid, I talked into her, saying it's better to get a newer version than getting an old model that's been out for so long! There's gotta be something so bad that Philips Avent decided to change after all these years. Also, as of right now, January 2013, this new model hasn't yet deployed to most retailers. I tried to find one in Target & Babies R Us, but came back with no luck!With the Prime membership, I received this quickly after I placed my order on the weekend. There are a few changes that I think it's making it so much better for working moms!1. Smaller & lighter motor to carry around!The motor is so much smaller than the previous generation, and it's also lighter! One thing about breastpump for working moms is that you need to carry this around after you get back to work, and this change just makes perfect sense to have a smaller & lighter motor!2. Small adapter! Yay!Comparing to the old model, the new adapter is sooooo much smaller! Another plus for moms to carry around this! After all, it's just nicer to carry something not so bulky!3. The bag is a plus!When I was using the old model, usually I ended up having to have the motor in the small bag, and everything else just kind of laying around in a mess! Now the new bag has two pockets on both sides, you can easily pull out / put in the bottles. Also, the bottles can stand very well without tipping off! That's just nice!4. The better angle for breastmilk pumping.With the old model, I remember myself sitting on the bed, leaning forward, in order to get the best result. Now the new angle finally seems to fix that problem! However, since this is a purchase for my sister-in-law, I can't quite be sure of this yet. Have to wait until my little nephew comes out to know it!All in all, I'm glad I've got this new model for my sister-in-law. My brother's family lives in Asia, and they don't deliver the new products as fast as it is in the States. Based on my past experiences, I'd recommend the this new model, SCF334/04, to parents who are considering between the old model & new model, especially for the new parents! No sense saving that price difference for the old one if you know you're gonna use it in a long run. This is just so much better than the old one, and I even want to get one for myself when I have #2! You'll feel the money is well-spent with this model!",5,1
"Kiddy City N Move Stroller, Walnut","For starters, it's the only stroller my little girl will fall asleep in which in itself is wonderful when we are gone all day.  Other strollers she would stay up all day long and you can imagine what that was like for a little one and for us.  Its padding is obviously comfortable to her.  You can just feel the quality in it.I think the best part is the canopy.  It's basically lights out for her when we are out in public.  With the extra sun shade that folds out, it makes it nice and dark in there.  Love the peek a boo window so I can keep an eye on her sitting or sleeping and you can cover that window back up with the cover if you want it fully dark inside.  So many positions to the canopy also.  And its got UV protection.Also love the full recline but be advised, in full recline position, don't expect to get much from the cargo area underneath.  It does have side zippers underneath where you can pull some stuff out.  It has these awful support bars that go across the cargo area making it half useless.  Definitely needs improvement there.  I do store jackets under the bar deep down into the cargo bag and put my purse on top of the bars but I have a smaller purse.  You will not get a full size diaper bag in there or any diaper bag for that matter so don't expect to use this as a full size stroller.  It's an umbrella stroller.  More for on the go, in and out kind of trips though I do use it at the mall.  I did decide to purchase the OXO Tot Stroller Hook.  It's great for my purse and shopping bags also which I hang my purse on when the baby is going to recline back for nappy.It comes with one cupholder but coming from a stroller that had 2, it was a definite must have.  I was able to secure one by ordering through Kiddy USA and contacted them via their facebook page so now we have 2.  And yes, there is a hook on both sides of the stroller so if you have just one cup holder, you can switch the side you keep it on.  It is also removable by just lifting up.  It connects via a small peg that stick out from the stroller.  Very simple to use.The bumper bar in the front is fully removable and it also bends completely upward if you have a younger baby in the seat and don't want to bother removing it.  I thought we would be removing it, but the baby actually really likes it.  She likes holding on to it, having her toys attached to it via links and we also purchased the Brica Snack Pod which we attach right to the bumper bar.  Gives her a place for a drink and snack also.The height of the handlebars works just fine for me and my husband.  I am 5ft 1"" and he is 5ft 7"".  They are not adjustable.  I thought it would be a little tall for me but when I compared it to our old Maclaren umbrella strollers, the height was the same.  From the floor to the top of the handle, you are looking at 41"".  Your hands will obviously be lower than that.  They are nicely padded for comfortThe seat width is 13"".  The backrest where the back meets the seat is 20"".  The seat has a foot extension so baby can have their legs directly out.  In that position the seat length is 13"" from front to where it meets the backrest at the back.  When the foot extension is in the down position, the seat depth is roughly 10"" from the bend of the foot extension to the back of the seat.It does include a 5 point harness and while many of the newer strollers do not have a crotch strap that is long enough, this one seems sufficient as the baby grows.Let's see, what else.  Oh, the back of the backrest does have a pocket which is great for throwing keys or a phone or paci's etc.  I do wish it had a zipper closure so I could put those things in and feel they are a little more secure when my back is turned but it's not a big issue for me.  It just kind of pushes to and is covered a bit with the extra part of the canopy.As for the wheels, they are a nice size at 6"" which is what I preferred for an umbrella stroller but don't expect them to go through heavy snow if you live in a harder winter climate like we do in the midwest.  We have actually kept our full size stroller for that purpose and will use this one through the spring, summer and fall.This stroller is very easy to fold.  One pull of a tab at the back and one push on foot pedal at the side and fold and you will hear a click of the side latch locking mechanism, done.  It does weigh more than cheaper umbrella strollers but I account a lot of that to the durability of the frame.  You can just see and feel the difference.  Definitely not plastic like and cheap.  They are solid.One thing I do wish, since this stroller comes from a family owned company in Germany which I love, I do wish the company would expand more into the USA.  While I was able to secure another cupholder, I am not able to secure a footmuff, or the matching diaper bag or a rain cover.  These items are overseas only.  I have only found one company that will ship the footmuff to the United States but it's at a hefty cost obviously so we will probably end up going with a JJ Cole footmuff instead.There is a video of this stroller on youtube that I would highly recommend.  It is not in English, but watching it you will get just about all the information you need.  It was actually what sold me on this stroller.  Go to youtube and put this in the search bar to watch the video.  &oacute;&iacute;&agrave; &ntilde;&agrave; Kiddy City'n Move.I hope my review has helped you decide if this stroller is right for you.  We purchased this stroller in Walnut because I wanted something neutral for resell purposes later and it's perfect.  I gave this stroller 4 of 5 stars because of the cargo area cross bars that block getting in and out of the storage area easily as well as the unavailability of accessories here in the United States.",4,1
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Basket White, 2 Pack",These were perfect for our nursery! We used one for headbands and hair clips and the other for socks and tights :),5,1
"Bumbo Booster Seat, Blue","Great booster and I really like the way it three point snaps in front. A little on the lower side for my little one because she is tiny, but I just put a non skip kinda pad under it and it is perfect!Awesome booster and very much worth the little extra compared to those hard plastic ones.",5,1
"Bumbo Booster Seat, Blue","We have had this seat for almost a month now, we are very pleased and so is our 18 month old daughter.There are plenty of positive reviews so I am going to address some the negative reviews but also add my own perks; if you're anything like me, you read the 1-3 star reviews since all the 5 star just talk about how perfect it is. And who knows, you may not see this review since there are plenty of 5 stars already.CHAIR STRAPS: We did not have an issue with the straps being too long or with tightening them and we have small chairs. It does need to be tightened a certain way but it definitely feels more secure than the traditional &#34;pull to tighten&#34; like you would on the waist straps and they definitely will NOT come loose. Love that! It also sits nicely on our IKEA padded seats. You'd be surprised how many boosters out there are not padded seat friendly.WAIST STRAPS: These are easy enough and they do allow for some movement. Could she get out? No, but they are secure and the day she learns to unbuckle herself, we probably won't use them anyway. It's a booster seat. It is meant to teach them the beginnings of sitting at the table, not restrain, so yes, you're kid is going to be able to move around a bit.CLEANING: Love, love, LOVE how easy this is to clean. Wipe and go. And guess what? If it fades, it doesn't effect the overall use of the seat.PORTABILITY: Sure, it's a little bulky but when you're only carrying it to and from the car and your destination it beats a LOT of those other boosters out there. We wanted a plain and simple since piece seat. Who wants to take things apart and fold it back up? Lightweight, grab and go. Done.Did I leave anything out? I don't think so but if I did, I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for somewhere in the other reviews. Happy hunting! :)",5,1

"Boon Orb Bottle Warmer,Green","Love the Boon Orb! Its steam technology allows me to make a bottle of breastmilk or formula the perfect temp for my daughter. We use Tommee Tippee wide mouth bottles, and they do fit! My only word of caution is that you can't just reach for the bottle when it's done. The steam will burn the mess out of you. We use tongs to get the bottle out. But otherwise, love it! You put in the amount of water in a little measuring device (comes with the Orb) specific to ounces in bottle. Measurements are different depending on if it's room temperature or cold and if it's breastmilk or formula. It shuts off by itself (love!). A word of warning... I wouldn't let it sit too long in it once it's done, unless you don't mind waiting for it to cool off a little. I've let it sit a minute after it was done steaming, and it was scorching because there was steam still built up inside. This may be due to my wide mouth Tommee Tippee not allowing the steam to escape from the sides.",4,1
"Summer Infant Lil' Loo Potty, Pink","I bought two of these seats for my 2 year-old for potty training. We keep one at her babysitters house and one in my car for potty needs while driving. It is very simple but cheap, and it's perfect for what we need.",5,1

"Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch","While my use is out of the norm, we live across the street from my wifes parents. As their not able to take care of them-selfs fully, we are tasked with watching over them.This camera system is fantastic. The range reaches across the street. These are block homes and the signal is perfect. The ability to hear and see, along with being able to answer them is fantastic.Whether using to keep an eye on elderly, or the very young, this product is fantastic.Great range, good picture and 2 way communication. Also you can easily move the camera to monitor where you need it.",5,1
"Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch","UPDATE 2, Feb 22: Still love this baby monitor but it does have some quirks. The night vision is still quirky and isn't very sensitive. My biggest issue is that when I have it on VOX mode and the volume set to one bar it will kick on and be extremely loud! Louder than the volume is set. The only way for the volume to go back to one bar is for me to adjust the volume using the buttons and go back to one bar. It's very frustrating. I also noticed that the charger is loose. Otherwise I still adore this monitor.UPDATE Dec 5: After growing tired of the squeaking camera and the brightness issue I contacted Amazon. They advised me to contact Samsung. I attempted to email them and received no response. Contacted amazon again and they offered to replace the monitor. So I now have the new monitor and they have changed some things for the better!There is NO MORE start up chime!!!!The sleep button is now the camera button that you can press and hold to put monitor to sleep. I don't have multiple cameras so this made things a little more annoying for me but I rarely used the sleep button anyway so no huge loss.The night light button is now the zoom button and press and hold for night light. I LOVE this! I always hated having to go through the menu to zoom. This makes things a lot easier.One bad thing though is that this monitor has some MAJOR screen bleed. It's bad. I'm not super picky about this but some people are. I don't find that it seriously affects the picture though and is only visible on a black screen.I am much happier now that I have a monitor that is clear again and a camera that turns silently.UPDATE Nov 28: In the last few weeks I noticed the monitor looked brighter than usual. I have had it set on the highest brightness since we purchased it but it got to the point where it was so bright that I couldn't even see anything when the camera was on night vision. I turned the brightness down to 1 and it is still REALLY bright. It affects the clarity of the picture and makes it hard to see my daughter at night. The camera still has issues switching to night vision and back as well. That is very frustrating at times. I didn't take any stars away because I still really like this monitor but I am concerned that the brightness issue is going to get worse until I will be unable to see anything at all!I bought this monitor specifically for my newborn and toddler, who share a room, but have used it for my older children as well. I also have a Summer Infant Baby Touch 2 that I will compare with this unit in my review. I have had this camera since early July 2013.My first impression of the Samsung SEW-3037W was that it was very well made. Both the camera and monitor look very nice, especially compared to the Summer Infant monitor.I hung the camera on the wall, up high. It was very easy to do and all the hardware is included with the monitor. The power cord is kind of short so I had to use an extension cord. Do not do this if you are installing this camera near your infant's crib due to the chocking hazard. I installed mine across the room from my infant and toddler's bed.The battery in the monitor lasts anywhere from 8-12 hours depending on what settings you use(VOX which I will discuss later) and how you use the monitor(talk back).There are three settings; off, VOX, and on. When you set the camera to ""on"" the video and audio stay on. On VOX it will set the audio and video to sleep when there is no noise. There is also two sensitivity settings to set VOX to; high and low. I have mine set to low and it wakes up the monitor when there is noise in a nearby bathroom or bedroom. We have sound machines in our kid's bedrooms and even on the highest volume on my daughter's sleep sheep the monitor will still go to sleep. On the Summer Infant monitor it will randomly go to sleep and in order to ""wake"" it you push the video on button which takes FOREVER to turn it back on. The Samsung wakes up immediately.The monitor has night vision. It actually has invisible IR sensors which is one way the camera looks sleek, clean, and well made. This is one of my two problems with this camera, the sensitivity of the night vision. When my daughter takes a nap in the early morning her room is pretty dim. We have light blocking curtains and the sun does not shine through her window enough to light up the room. The night vision will not activate. I have tried panning the camera all over the room to find a dark spot but I can't get the IR to trip on. This makes it very hard to see my daughter. It's even worse on a raining, cloudy day. It also has issues with the night vision turning OFF. If the lights are turned on in the room at night I have to pan the camera around till it finds a spot to trip off the night vision.The quality of the picture is pretty good. The Summer Infant is slightly sharper but all the negatives with that monitor far outweigh the sharper picture. With the Samsung I can see everything I need to see. The only time the monitor is extremely unclear is when the lighting is dim like I mentioned earlier. The delay is VERY minimal. If you expect perfectly smooth video you will be disappointed but it is smooth enough that you can see EVERYTHING that is happening.The zoom isn't great. It is just a digital zoom and does get kind of blurry when you use it but it is still good enough to see what you need to see.The pan and tilt is SUPER useful. I am able to pan from my daughter's bed to my son's bed to see them both. My only complaint is that the camera is a little noisy, could just be my camera though. My son can hear when the camera moves at night because it squeaks/grinds a bit. So often times he will ask what the noise is. It kind of scared him at times. Like I said though, this could just be my camera as I don't recall if it made this noise when I first got it.  I will say though that the Summer Infant has motion tracking which I love. I so wish the Samsung did as well.The talk back feature is extremely useful as well. When my son starts to climb out of bed I just tell him to lay back down and he does. The audio is clear enough that they can understand me. There are 5 volume settings. The volume settings are great when the house is noisy and I need everyone in that area of the house to hear me or when everyone is asleep and I just need to talk to my toddler son without waking everyone else. I have also used this monitor in my living room to watch my older kids while I showered and it was so useful to keep an eye on everyone at once.I have not use multiple cameras so I can't comment on that.The screen shows the time which I find VERY useful! The Summer Infant does not show the time.There is also a clip so you can put it on you to carry it and there is a stand as well.The Samsung does not play lullabies or show the temperature but I personally don't find those options useful.My connection is almost always at 5 bars. The only time I have noticed it fluctuate is if my phone is on wifi and right next to the monitor. My laptop does not affect it, only my cell phone. I was able to take the monitor outdoors and could get out pretty far before I lost connection. This monitor does alert when you have no connection. It beeps every few seconds. The Summer Infant does not alert. I rarely put the antenna up.I see a lot of complaints about the start up sound. Yes, it's loud. I don't often turn my monitor on while in the room with my sleeping children but I have been nursing my infant daughter to sleep and turned the monitor on to watch my toddler son and it's somewhat jarring to my daughter. I know now to cover the speaker when starting it up. I did laugh the first time I heard it. It sounds like a handheld gaming machine from the 90's.I personally really like this monitor. I liked it a lot and then I won the Summer Infant in a contest and after using it I love the Samsung WAY more. The problems I have with it are very minor and I can live with them especially in a world of imperfect monitors. I researched a lot before purchasing and never did I find a monitor that everyone was happy with 100% of the time.",4,1
"Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch","Night vision sensor keeps flicking on and off unless you get it in the perfect spot. Places it worked fine yesterday, it won't work today.edit -- The unit works fine now. Make sure the plug is firmly inserted into the camera. Might take a little tape if you are having issues but mine works without it. Soltechsecurity called me after they found out I was having issues and helped me with my problems. Great service.",4,1
"Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch","We never owned a video monitor before and finally got one for our toddler.  So far I love it.  I researched this model, Motorola, Lorex and Summer monitors and this one seemed to have the most positive reviews.  Below is some of feedback about the monitor (we only had it for two nights so far).1. The start up sound everyone is talking about is not and should not be a deal breaker. It literally last 3 seconds and it is not annoying at all.2. The pan and tilt works great and mounting it on the wall took no time at all.  It just took us some trail and error to find the best spot in the room for the camera.3. The picture on the monitor is clear as day. Even at night I could see him perfect. The only time seeing him is an issue is when he is sleeping against the bed rail. The bed rail is white and his PJs were white so that was probably the problem. I turn off the picture at night and just leave it on voice. When I wake up during the night, I just hit one button and I could see him.4. The first night we set up the monitor I left the nightlight on the monitor on. My son just stared at it for almost 30 minutes and would not go to bed. Easy fix- just shut off the light. Once I did that he was out.  I wouldn't recommend leaving it on at night.5. We will be purchasing another camera in a few months for our next baby so hopefully we will not have any problems setting it up.If you are still in the air about what monitor to get, I would recommend this one to my family and friends.  I'm so glad I did my homework and I think we ended up with a great monitor.",4,1
Mountain Buggy 2013 Terrain Stroller (Flint),"I am SO SO SO happy we got this stroller. It is super easy to push, easier than the bob we had previously, and my daughter is really comfortable in the seat. I love the telescoping canopy and the versatile fold options. I love the multitude of pockets perfect for my iphone in its otter case and my keys and 2 water bottles. Our enormous diaper bag fits under it when we want to bring it. The buggy travels easily over sand and grass, and is a smooth and comfy ride.I originally chose this model because at 5'8&#34; and my husband's 6'4&#34; we were uncomfortable with the strollers we had previously bought and sold (the bob ironman & the peg perego pliko switch). The wide space between the rear wheels and the telescoping handle made pushing this stroller easier on our upper body's for not having to hunch down and we are no longer kicking the wheels.The wheels don't come inflated, and we had to go to a gas station to put air in them. Thats a bummer but if you are prepared it's no big deal.I would recommend this stroller as an all around stroller to anyone with about 3 1/2 x2 feet of storage space to stow it in the car-its not at all small but fits well in the back of our ford flex and our buick's trunk.I love it and if we have more kids I hope the double stroller is just as good.",5,1

"The First Years True Fit SI C680 Car Seat, Naturalization",I own a different version of the True Fit series that I bought for my now 3 1/2 year old daughter when she was one. I love that car seat and I love this one even more! The colors are beautiful in person and perfect for a boy or a girl! It is kind of bland once you take the insert out but my almost 9 month old son (who is 24lbs and 28 1/2in) fills up the seat so it doesn't really matter anyways. These seats are extremely safe and comfortable. I highly recommend them to all of my friends and acquaintances! Very much so worth the money :),5,1

Levana Astra 3.5&quot; PTZ Digital Baby Video Monitor with Talk to Baby Intercom 32006 (White),"Baby monitors are a dime a dozen - check the local baby store and you'll find 40 different models - each with even bigger claims. The Levana Astra is one that actually delivers what it promises.Lets go over the features one at a time:RangeA real winner - no idea how they pulled it off, but the range on this thing is amazing. You can actually put it upstairs and sit out on the porch at the other side of the house without any interference. In my house, no other devices interfered either (5.4GHz WiFi and 5GHz phones). Excellent. Image appears to be digital - it is either there, or it isn't.Image qualityLook, this is no 1080P HD TV - the picture won't wow you, but it is perfectly clear enough to see how your baby is doing, and most importantly, it'll tell whether his/her eyes are open.Audio qualityNot bad at all - again, this isn't Dolby Surround, but it won't give any false positives either. The color ring around the control changes when it senses audio and sensitivity can be adjusted.PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom)Mostly perfect - Pan and Tilt are FAST, but you need to make sure the unit is in PTZ mode or the D-pad won't work. Zoom is mediocre as it is just a digital zoom.Build qualityNot bad at all - the camera can be wall mounted, the monitor has a kickstand and moving antenna.FeaturesIncludes built in lullaby sounds (might be nice if you travel and baby is without their mobile). No video output, which is a shame. Battery operated monitor means you can carry it around the house.ConclusionEverything is perfect - except for the price. There are cheaper (MUCH CHEAPER) options here on Amazon for around half the price, so do your research before purchasing. That said, reviews of those cheaper units clearly point out reception issues, something the Astra doesn't suffer from. So as usual, you get what you pay for. Pay a premium for this unit, and get something that'll make you and your baby happy for a long time. And best of all, items like this hold their value, so once your baby is beyond the camera age, you can sell it again :)",5,1

"KF Baby Non-Skid Baby Boy Shoe Socks, 6 pairs, for 12 - 24 Months","These little socks seem to be quite well made.  I bought them for a 10-month-old so his feet have to get a little bigger to fit right.  But they did seem to prevent him from slipping while he had them on.  They are cute little things too, trying to look like shoes.  They should fit perfect on a 12-month-old.",5,1

Klean Kanteen 18 oz Stainless Steel Water Bottle (Sports Cap 3.0 in Black) - Ocean Blue,"I have a larger canteen by this company and wanted a smaller one that would fit our car - this one fit perfect and makes it easy for the passenger (typically my wife or I) to get a quick drink while on the road. We got a second one, with the standard cap for the drivers side, since a driver will be parked when getting a drink and the standard cap is more reliable, long term.",5,1
Mustachifier - The Cowboy Mustache Pacifier,"This was the perfect addition to my son's Harley rider Halloween costume when he was about 18 months old. It was adorable and really completed the outfit. However, the actual binky part is pretty small. It wasn't an accurate size for an 18 month old, but it still worked great! Super cute and got lots and lots of wonderful compliments about it!",4,1
"Chicco Liteway Plus Stroller, Equinox","My parents bought this stroller for their grandkids and we borrowed it to use with our 1-year-old for a trip because it was more compact than our Bumbleride Flyer. We have yet to return it because we love it so much. I've used it every day since. If I were to do my initial stroller buying all over again, I would get this stroller and the Chicco Keyfit carseat, since it snaps right in--amazing for travel.It is heavier than most umbrella strollers, but the fact that it's so sturdy (we have really uneven, bumpy sidewalks) and it can take a carseat completely outweighs (ha ha) the extra weight, IMO.It actually handles rough terrain better than my full-size stroller. Other things I love: almost full recline (babe naps like a champ in it), pretty big canopy for an umbrella stroller (even in full recline), easy to steer with one hand, folds up compactly, wheels come off easily for travel.It's not perfect. What would make it even better:* one-handed fold (still a lot easier to fold than my full-size though)* lighter* larger basket* sturdier canopy (it unsnaps from the frame sometimes when I'm adjusting it) with pop-out SPF shade like the Uppababy strollers* shoulder strap rather than fabric handle* ability to buy a rain cover and full-coverage sun shade to fit, and a travel bag* eliminating the annoying flap of fabric on the harness that has to be tucked in around the buckle (this may be the thing that bothers me the most, because it seems so easy to fix)There is no perfect stroller for every instance though. Overall, a fantastic stroller.",5,1

"Graco SnugRide Click Connect 35 Car Seat, Tangerine",This carseat is super easy to install. It is also one of the few carseats that has up to 4 fittings for the shoulder part of the harness and 2 fittings for the crotch buckle.

"Graco DuoDiner LX Highchair, Metropolis","It is the perfect fit for my toddler.  He like sitting there for his meals.  The food tray is super easy to clean.

"Graco Travel Lite Crib with Stages, Peyton","I purchased this item following the birth of my youngest grandson.  It's the perfect combination of bassinet, crib and playpen!  It is easy to assemble and moves easily from room to room.  The stages are great, no bending low to get a tiny baby in and out and no worrying that he'll roll off the couch or bed.  I purchased the Travel Lite crib sheets and a flannel pad and he sleeps comfortably.  My only regret is that I didn't have this when my older grandchildren were babies!",5,1
"Graco FastAction Fold Jogger Click Connect Stroller, Grapeade","Graco's FastAction Jogging Stroller definitely gives other brands such as Phil and Teds and BOB a run for the money.  There are a lot of things to like about this stroller, with a few cons - but these cons are highly subjective (you'll see why later in the review).  I experimented running with this stroller with both my kids (a little over 30 lb 3 year old and a 40 something pound 5 year old).  I did not test this stroller with the FastAction carseat.  Here's a quick overview before I delve more into detail about the pros and cons of this stroller:Set up for the stroller was fairly straight forward, and most items on the stroller were preassembled.  Each item would loudly click into place, so you'll know if a piece is in or not.  The only piece I had a little difficulty inserting was the kickstand piece.  This piece requires you to snap a plastic piece on a metal bar on the underside of the stroller - thankfully my husband had no problem pushing that piece in!  Disassembly is also very easy - many of the components can be removed by pushing a button and pulling the component out.  Some pieces are optional (arm rests for the kids, kid tray, and parent tray).  The parent tray includes a spot to securely hold you cell phone in both a horizontal or vertical orientation, as well as an closeable compartment for keys, chapsticks, GUs, etc.  There is an arm tether strap attached to the bottom storage basket area, in case you want added security when running down hills.Each brake can be locked individually on the back tires.  There is a huge storage basket that is made out of fabric, so you can store towels, diaper bag, diapers, water bottles, and other sundry items.  The seat is adjustable to 3 positions - fully sitting up, partially reclining, and lying down.  Adjusting the seat is very easy - simply push the seat up until it clicks to get the seat in an upright position, then squeeze two bars located on the back of the seat to recline.  To collapse the stroller, you just pull up on a strap located in the crease on the child's seat.  To assemble, just unlatch the large plastic clip on the side of the seat and lift the stroller's handlebar upwards.  Folding and  down really took minimal effort.PROSThe WheelsWith an air filled 12"" diameter bicycle wheel in the front, and a pair of air filled 16"" diameter bicycle wheels in the rear, the wheels allow for a smoother ride for the child.  When taking my kid out for a run in the park, the ride seemed smooth with very few bumps.  This stroller would be great for running on jogging trails and for going over rougher terrain.  The distance from wheel to foot is also good.  Because the handlebars are set further back, I had no issues with bumping the basket or wheels on the stroller while running.Good ControlControl is a huge issue when maneuvering anywhere with a stroller - even when not running.  I found that I was able to maneuver this stroller easily when running, and had an equally easy time when just rolling with this stroller through the zoo, where slightly smaller aisles are sometimes.  The front wheel allows for good turns, and unlike the Phil and Ted's Sports V.2, we didn't have issues with a locked wheel on smooth surfaces like linoleum.The CanopyThis canopy is awesome.  The canopy is large, has a closeable flap parent view window (uses mesh to look through instead of plastic, and can be covered with more material so no light goes down), and has mesh openings on the sides so the kids can see to the sides of them without having to lean forward to look around the canopy.  Our old Phil and Ted Sports stroller didn't even cover half the amount that this canopy does.  If you happen to have a carseat clicked into place, this canopy would allow for full coverage of the top of the carseat/stroller, and because of the mesh sides, your kid will be able to breath easy and have a little diffused light going in, just so you can keep an eye on him/her.The Parent TrayThis is the first parent tray I've seen that actually has the parent in mind.  There are two cup holders for drinks - to go coffee cups, water bottles, soda cans, and so forth will fit in there fine without fear of tippage.  The cup holders are deep, and are made of rigid plastic.  The smartphone/iPod holder is a nice touch.  With many parents using apps like Runkeeper, iFit, etc on their phones to track mileage, it was about time that someone put a designated holder for the phone.  There is a spring loaded bar that will hold the phone in place.  Underneath the phone holder is a compartment for all those other items you want to bring, but don't necessarily want in plain view for everyone.  I was able to stow my keys, my phone, a small wallet, and a pack of candy I didn't want the kids to see in there.  This is probably the best thing about the parent tray - I can keep my stuff close at hand without having to resort to using the cup holders to hold everything.Storage BasketWhile made of mesh sides and nylon material for the bottom, this basket is quite durable.  You can easily stow a diaper bag in there, or in my case a bunch of jackets, bags of snacks, and my purse in there. When we took this stroller to the zoo, we were able to stow our full Case Logic dSLR camera backpack in the storage basket with enough room to spare for an extra jacket for each of my two kids, as well as a couple of small snacks.  This would be a good stroller to take along for long hikes.The Kickstand and Setup/Fold downMost strollers are like puzzles when setting up and breaking down.  You have to take multiple steps and push multiple buttons in the correct sequence to get it up or down.  This stroller really is the easiest to set up a break down.  Unlock one latch and lift up handlebar to set up, and pull one handle and lift up to break down.  The kickstand is the best thing about the whole breakdown process...when you pull the handle up, the stroller folds and the kickstand keeps it in the upright position.  This means that when your stroller is folded, you don't have to tip it over gently to lay it down on the floor, then later bend over to pick it up off the floor.  My husband raved about this, simply because he was the one who usually has to load this in the car, and bending over to pick up a 30 something pound stroller isn't fun.Huge Buttons to Remove the Wheels/Armrests/Trays/EtcI hate having to search under, under, behind, etc to find those tiny little metal ""buttons"" to push into the plastic in order to release the wheels and other pieces from a stroller.  I hate having to use a screwdriver to push pieces in because my fingers are just too fat/delicate to mash those buttons in.  Thank you Graco, for making those release buttons HUGE and easily accessible.  Now I can take off those extra pieces when I need to without having to struggle.  Best part - just because the buttons are huge doesn't mean than pieces will accidently get triggered and fall off.  You still need to work to remove pieces - just not insanely hard to do so.The FabricIt's easily spot cleaned and durable.  What's not to like?  From what I've seen, it doesn't stain easily, either.The FootrestNormally I wouldn't include this in a review, however, Graco really got something really right with this footrest.  It's all rigid plastic, with a small dotted texture for grip.  This allows for easy cleanup.  The other thing I like about it is that it's not this huge blocky footrest like the old Graco systems.  It's just large enough for my kids to rest their feet, but not so large that it's bumping into everything when I happen to use this stroller in smaller spaces.CONSNonadjustable Height for HandlebarAt a lofty 5' tall, this is a slightly difficult stroller for me to maneuver.  Because the handlebar is part of one long bar that extends down the side of the stroller, there is no way to adjust the bar up or down.  When I hold onto the handlebars, my hands are positioned at about chest level - not a terrible position, but not entirely comfortable either.  When the canopy is up, I cannot see directly in front of the stroller wheel, and therefore have a tough time gauging how far I have in front of me before bumping into something.  For taller people, this won't be an issue.  My husband, who is 5'7"" didn't have a problem with the bar height.Cellphone HolderIf you have an iPhone 5 with a case on, or any phone larger than an iPhone 5, your phone will NOT fit well in the cell holder.  I tested out the phone holder with both the case on and off my phone (I have a Belkin Clear Case on my phoneBelkin View Case / Cover For New Apple iPhone 5 (Black)) and my phone would not fit in either the vertical or horizontal orientation.  When I remove the case, the phone fit fine in the horizontal orientation, but was a very VERY tight fit for the vertical orientation - the iPhone 5 is just too tall.  My friend just laughed when he saw the opening and didn't even try to put his Samsung Galaxy in there.  iPhone 4s, iPods, and other smaller phones will fit in there, just fine.Weight & SizeI found this stroller to be too heavy to want to lug in and out of the car.  It practically takes up the entire trunk of my Prius (that said, Prius trunks are not very big), and to get maximum fold down, you have to take off the kid tray.  However, my husband and I agree that if you are going on a day trip with the kids/going on holiday with the kids, this stroller is totally worth is - Disneyland or the zoo is 100% more enjoyable when you don't have to haul all the kid's bags on your back, and the kids can relax a little in the stroller.  But again, at 5', this thing is a bear for me to get in and out of the car.  Most people probably won't have a problem with this, but I certain did.All in all, I really like this stroller.  The biggest cons I have with the stroller really are because I'm short - for most people who average out at 5'4 for women and 5'10 for men (according to Google), this stroller is parent perfect.  It has a lot of great features for both the child and parent.  Highly recommended.",5,1
Happy Wrap Baby Organic Bamboo Carrier - Slate,My baby girl loves being in this wrap. The material is comfortable against both her and my skin.

Harlow 5 Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set with Bumper by Cocalo Couture,"This bed set was a great buy. It is perfect for the person looking for something that is not pink, purple or pastel.

Grovia My Choice Trainer (Surf),"I used the grovia hybrid system for my son, unfortunately, we brought the snap enclosures which leave marks on his skin as he has gotten bigger.  He is 18 months now and the Trainer was the perfect alternative.  Keeps messes in (when changed regularly approx every 3-4 hours), still easy to change him without a mess and will grow with him.  Great product.",5,1

It looks exactly like the picture ;)",5,1
Yummi Pouch (Set of 6),"After trying store bought brands and not being satisfied, I decided to try my hand at making my own baby food.

They are great on the go, my kids love them, they freeze great, and wash up in the dishwasher on top rack beautifully.I highly recommend yummi pouches to anyone making baby food,  taking food on the go, or wanting reusable food containers.One happy mama,Elizabeth",5,1
Yummi Pouch (Set of 6),"Bought these to see if the kids like them. They do! We've used them several times so far and they seem to show no wear or problems breaking down soon.I find these easy to fill by just pouring applesauce or yogurt directly from the jar or tub. I could see the special pouring cup would be a bit neater but I havent longed for one yet.They are a nice size, bigger than the prefilled pouch applesauce which I like for my hungry boys as they are just starting 5 days a week in school.I put them in the dishwasher with great results.My plan is to fill all of them on Sunday so we have grab-and-go convenience all week. So, 6 more pouches should be perfect!",5,1
Evenflo Chase LX - Aqua Optical,This car seat arrived in perfect condition. My only problem is that the anchor straps are never long enough.

Wabi Baby Electric Steam Baby Bottle Sterilizer and Dryer,"I have to pump every 2-3 hours. It's SUCH a pain to break down, wash, and dry all of the tiny pieces in the breast pump. Drying took especially long because of all the small spaces in some of the breast pump parts. This item is PERFECT. It significantly decreased the time it took me to clean all the pieces in between pumping sessions. The tub is really big - it can hold several bottles, along with two sets of pumping parts. I just rinse the parts in soapy water and then throw it into the WABI to sanitize and dry. Everything's dry and ready to use when I come back for the next pumping session. It was totally worth the $$$!",5,1

"North States Superyard 3 In 1 Arched Decor Metal, Matte Bronze",This was better than I expected. I use it as a play pen around a full-sized futon...fits almost perfectly with 2 extra panels (so 10 panels total) and it is holding up really well. So easy to install not complicated at all after figuring out which side fits accordingly-don't forget to tighten the connecting bars (I didn't realize this until I took a really close look). It is so easy to position in any way you need. It looks really nice with dark wood furniture too. We'll worth every penny!,5,1
Hello Kitty Baby Soft Blocks,"I received this product free of charge and my initial response was that the blocks were charming.  I&#8217;ve never met a child who wasn&#8217;t enamored with Hello Kitty. And I&#8217;ve met quite a few adults who are fond of her as well! This little cat and her friends have universal appeal. The blocks measure roughly 3 &#8221; across and are perfectly sized for babies and small children.  They are lightweight and the edges have a wide piping. Both features make the toy easy for tiny hands to grab hold. The pastel color scheme, pink, yellow, blue and green is pleasing to the eye. There are four blocks total, two each with rattles inside, two with crumpled plastic that makes crinkly noises. Like most toys these days, they are made in China. This was a bit of a concern for me. But the box is clearly marked Phthalate and other chemicals free, and the toy meets with the standard consumer safety specifications for safety. Each block is sweetly illustrated. One fold out flap reveals a tiny mouse, another a crackly giraffe. Hello Kitty has a soft furry face.  There&#8217;s also a tiny mirror, though of course it&#8217;s not glass, so the image is distorted. Shiny is still fun! Great for grabbing, shaking, chewing, crackling, stacking and knocking down. The list price is a bit high for only four blocks, but the discounted Amazon cost is reasonable. This set would make for a great gift.",4,1

Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,Great Reusable little pouch. Easy to clean in the dishwasher and easy to use. I make all of my own baby food so this is perfect for my kids. I don't have to waste money on the pouches at the store. Recommend for anyone!,5,1
Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,"I've been obsessed with making my own baby food AND buying premade baby food in pouches (You know for those times you just have to grab and go).  With my homemade baby food, it's usually not practical to put the cubes in a container and bring it with you.  I started researching reusable pouches for those weekend errand days where I can feed the baby food I've made.  These work perfectly!  I usually put a couple of cubes in the pouch a day before and leave it in the fridge.  The ziplock seal on top is really tight and even when i fold up the bottom and squeeze the last drops out, it doesn't open.  I've been recommending these to everyone!",5,1
Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,"When my daughter was on the WIC program we would get packaged food for free. Now that she's older than one, we don't get this anymore. She's now also super picky and prefers the packaged, liquid food that she's been used to. I got these so that I could start making my own food at home, and I'm so happy that I did. It's MUCH cheaper than buying in-store and the packs are very convenient. Below are the reasons why I love this product.CLEANING: It's very easy to clean. After each use I put in some water, close the top, shaking it up and let it soak for a little bit. Then I stick a bottle brush in there and it gets nice and clean.FOOD: I love that they offer recipes on their website, so definitely check that out if you can. I also just look at the combinations that I see on pre-prepared packages and copy those. My daughter's favorite combination is anything with mango because it's sweet and yummy, so I've been doing mango and spinach as well as mango and carrots. I also like to buy applesauce and mix that with other veggies.CUSTOMER SERVICE: The customer service is also wonderful. When I first received these the top seal on one of the packages instantly broke, even though I followed the directions to open the spout and blow into it. I went to their website, e-mailed them, and they e-mailed me back very promptly. I only asked for one replacement for the one that was broken (the other three were fine) but they gave me an entire other package for free in exchange for me sending the defective product back so they could see the problem. I see this as very responsible on their part.ACCESSORIES: I highly recommend getting the spout for this product. Although we had our own spouts, I found that they would slip out. The spout that they sell is formatted to their product and the bottom part is made of silicone, so it doesn't slip out and fits perfectly on top.",5,1

Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,"I love Little Green Pouch, product and company both!I ordered the Little Green Pouches after having previously used BooginHead Squeez'Ems Reusable Food Pouches. I liked the Squeez'Ems pouches, but there were a few things I hated (1-the cap for the mouthpiece is attached to the mouthpiece which is distracting for my toddler-she just wants to play with it, 2- lid is difficult to snap closed, 3- the pouches don't hold very much).Little Green Pouches have everything I love about Squeez'Ems and nothing I hated!They make it so easy to get healthy food into my child without a fight. They are convenient to take on the go and let my child enjoy the independence of feeding herself. The cap on the mouthpiece comes off, so my toddler isn't distracted by it. They are easy to fill. I can freeze them to take in a cooler on trips. The zipper top is easy to close. They are dishwasher safe. The pouches hold over 6 oz of food, which is perfect for my toddler. I purchased thePouchPop Topper 4 Count for Pouch Feeding, 4 Months Plusto go along with the Little Green Pouches and they are the perfect addition to this product.I did have a problem with my original order, but I contacted Maggie (Co-Founder with Little Green Pouch) and she went above and beyond to resolve the problem. I have rarely experienced such incredible customer service. They are outstanding!Little Green Pouches are a necessity for all families with toddlers, and I've decided that they will be my ""go to"" baby shower gift. These would also be great for anyone who has an ""on-the-go"" lifestyle and would like to have the convenience of healthy portable food.Love this product, love this company! Cannot rave enough about them!",5,1
(500-Pack) U-Fill Snack Pack Reusable Refillable Baby Food Pouch,"This product is awesome! I love that fact that it is very affordable compared to other products that are available. That is very important to my family! I also noticed how durable this product is.  I have a young child who can be very hard on things and your U-Fill Snack Pack is durable enough to handle him!  That is very important to me! I have never had a spill or leak of any kind.  Another thing I love is the convenience that I am afforded now. When you are a mom, being able to have some extra time on my hands is so nice.  I am able to give him his U-Fill and he can feed himself! Another aspect that makes this all worth while is being able to make foods for him and the U-Fill pack is a perfect size for storage in my fridge and freezer.I also noticed how easy U-Fill is to clean.  I have washed them with hot water and soap and I have washed them in the dishwasher and both ways work nicely.  I like the fact there is no residue or smell from prior foods!  I also like that the U-Fill doesn't look worn after washing in the dishwasher.  It looks brand new which leads me to believe I am going to get several uses out of each pack. This product is awesome and I would highly recommend it to anyone with kids!",5,1

FreeHand Mei Tai Baby Carrier in Jane,"I've got anERGObaby Organic Baby Carrier, and I love it, but it's a little too much carrier for my 3 week old summer newborn - we both end up sweaty and cranky, and all that fabric (straps and waist padding and infant insert/rolled-up blanket) adds extra weight to my already sore back.The FreeHand Mei Tai is a perfect solution. The fabric isn't as thick as the Ergo, and I'm able to easily tie it in such a way that the baby is right up against my body, which makes her feel more secure and doesn't leave my back aching. Plus it's really cute - the silver flowers sparkle!I'd worried about how difficult it would be to get it on and off without help, but tying it is simple and it comes with a little instruction card for a few different styles.Looking forward to seeing how well it works when the baby is bigger!",5,1
"Graco DuetSoothe Swing + Rocker, Winslet","Exactly what I wanted!  It is perfect and went to my new Great Granddaughter,  Jolea Sara Locke, born 3/14/2014!  It is sturdy and nice looking.  Martha J Reed",5,1
"Graco DuetSoothe Swing + Rocker, Winslet","This Graco offers a rocker and swing which is awesome since the rocker can be moved from room to room, but it is a bit on the heavier side (especially compared to other portable rockers.It plays music but the mobile doesn't rotate fully. I'd still recommend the Fischer Price Snug a Bunny swing over this one. They're around the same price and take up the same amount of space but the FP swing is more reliable and sturdy.If you want more tips on what to get for your newborn, visit the website AllMomsArePerfect.com.

Yoomi 8oz Baby Bottle + **BONUS** Tooth Tissues Sample!,"I got 2 the bottles and 1 warmer and the Warner was leaking blue solution. I contacted the seller and had NO problems getting a new one.the seller shipped FAST both times. This bottle works as described and warms the feed to the perfect temperature. It's easy to assemble but a little time consuming to charge if u don't have a microwave pod; I can't find one anywhere. The down side is u only get one use until u recharge it again and who says you'll be somewhere to warm it on a stove top when ur not at home; you also only get 150 uses b4 u have to buy another and I feel it should have more uses. Also, the warmer is heavy so the bottle sux when it's in there LOL. But I will say that it's a very good product and anyone should purchase at least once.",4,1

"Bumkins Reusable Snack Bags, Pink Love Birds and Bloom, 2-Count","I purchased these reusable snack bags for my two-year-old daughter as an alternative to wasteful plastic bags. My daughter loves these bags! I do too, especially the very useful zipper that they have. The quality is great and the price is perfect! These are Eco-friendly, very cost effective, and healthier than regular plastic bags.",4,1

"timi &amp; leslie Abby 7-Piece Diaper Bag Set, Ocean Blue","I absolutely LOVE this diaper bag, it is the perfect bag after all of my searching!  It's great for a slightly older infant (mine is 9 months) where 1-2 small outfits, a bottle, a few diapers, some toys are all you need.  I LOVE the internal wristlet/clutch bag with included credit card slots.  It's perfect to grab to run into the store.  There is a hook so you never lose your keys.  The pockets are perfect.  The material is so soft and feels like real leather, but it's wipeable.  This diaper bag is truly perfect. You would never suspect it's a diaper bag but all of the features are there.  I take it to work and all of the baby stuff is there when I need it.",5,1

Simba Warming Baby Dish Set With Fork &amp; Spoon (Orange),"I try to avoid using microwave on heating up food for my 20 months old girl so I used to put her food in a glass bowl then covereded up in another bowl filled with hot water. I found this item from Amazon and it's the perfect item! I thought it would be too big to store but actually it is the right size which benefits the little hand to utilize the utensils given. In addition, I really love the fork & spoon that come with it!I do not give 5 stars because I cannot open to wash the bottom part. But I don't think there's any issue if I only fill this up with water.",4,1
Nuk Learner Cup 5 Oz Giraffe Design Neutral Greens Browns 6+ Months,"Thank you NUK for making the best sippy cup ever.  I think I've bought/tried them all.  Others leak, the milk comes out too fast, the top doesn't line up with the handles.  Not this one.  The handles are the perfect size for little hands.  Baby can hold with one hand while eating snacks with the other hand.  You can turn the bottle part so the spout is in perfect alignment.Today since all the good NUK cups were dirty, I used ""another"" kind.  I've been teaching my daughter sign language and today she kept asking for milk (with a cup full of milk in her hand).  Finally I realized she was pointing right at a dirty NUK cup.  She wouldn't drink until I washed it and poured her milk into the NUK cup.  So this shouldn't be my review, it should be my 13 month old's review.",5,1
Aqua Chevron and Aqua Minky Nursing Pillow Cover By Blvd67,I really like this cover.  It fits perfectly and was easy to slip on the pillow. I love the pattern and minky material. I havent seen this available at any stores. I do want to mention that it did take about a week and a half longer to receive it than what it said.  So expect to wait a while.,5,1
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Double Stroller, Red","After countless hours of researching double strollers I had my heart set on the Baby Jogger City Select with the second seat.  I thought I really wanted a tandem stroller as opposed to a side by side for my 2 1/2 year old and new baby.  I had read all the reviews and had made up my mind.  After taking a trip to Disney World I changed my mind.  I had looked at the BJ City Mini Double in the past and decided no, but after seeing both strollers in action at the park I was awakened to the fact that for what I wanted the stroller for the CMD GT was what I wanted.  Not only did it function better in many scenarios it was almost the same width as the City Select.I didn't buy the car seat adapter because I read some reviews that said it's bulky and annoying to use.  We have the Baby Jogger Summit XT stroller that we got before my son was born and the adapter for that sucked...we bought the ""Chicco"" specific one and our seat never really sat in it very well.  So I figured we would end up having the same issue with the one for this stroller.  I did however buy the double belly bar and with that my chicco key fit 30 fits in the seat perfect and even snaps in.  I wouldn't jog or anything with it but I don't jog anyways lol.  You do have to remove the sun visor which is much easier than on the Summit XT, with that car seat adapter you have to remove the sunshade and it has screws involved so this was a nice change.As soon as my second son is born and we get out on the road with this stroller I will update my review.Oh and by the way, the basket under storage is large, my 2 1/2 year old climbed in and wanted to ride down there....so for all of those complaining about that I think they're crazy lol.  It's a much better basket than I am used to with the Summit XT!",5,1

Iplay Boys Mixed Color Ultimate Swim Diaper - This Is for 1 Diaper - Size 3T,"We are on our third size of these. They definitely work- we've never had an accident. Based on other reviews I ordered a size up the first two times... and actually two sizes up most recently. My son wore a 2T shorts but I got the 4T- a little big but still worked fine. Now that he is a 3T they fit perfectly. We got a weird print when we ordered it since you don't get to choose, but nobody sees it since he wears board shorts over it.",4,1

"Graco Double Dresser, Classic Cherry","For the price, this is a great dresser. Not too difficult to assemble. The dresser is also serving as a changing table, and it works great for that purpose.Minor complaints:1) One of the drawers sticks when you try to open it. The metal guide came with a screw that was crooked. I can fix this, though, so it's not a huge problem.2) Once the drawers are installed, they don't all align perfectly...there are gaps on one side, or on the top. No big deal...just detracts from the overall look.3) This dresser is not bright white. We have a white crib (Graco Charleston), a few other items, and some white trim in the nursery that are all bright white. This dresser claims to be bright white, but it is clearly not as bright as the other items. More of a cream color. However, we would still buy this again, even though it is not an exact color match.",4,1
InfinityMOM Nursing Scarf (Coral Chevron),"I consider myself an 'out in public' breastfeeding master. I'm on my second child and there is no place I won't nurse him. That being said, I'm not one to flaunt it. This is the perfect cover because it's fashionable and versatile, I love wearing it as an infinity scarf, it's very cute! It offers full coverage. Other nursing covers I've tried often leave you hanging out the side or back. This covers all those areas and most of baby so it's great for cooler weather. If you aren't wearing it as a scarf, it folds up nice and small so it doesn't take up much room in your diaper bag. I bought the gray scarf and the color makes it so it's not so obvious that I'm nursing when out in public like other nursing covers. I highly recommend this product!",5,1
Joovy Twin Roo Car Seat Stroller,"Ever since I discovered I was expecting twins, I began my search for a stroller that would fit into my PT Cruiser.  I didn't want to buy a new vehicle just to fit a double stroller!  I found the &#34;Baby Trend Snap n Go Universal Double&#34; and thought I was set.  Wrong.  When I did more research, I found that the car seats just lay on top; they do not snap in, so that made me a bit skeptical.  In a new search, I found this Joovy Twinroo and Loved what I saw.  No reviews or videos yet since it's so new, so I decided to just order it and return it if necessary.  I LOVE it.  After putting it together, I took it to Babies R Us and found car seats that are perfect.  (It says Chicco, Graco, and Peg Perego infant car seats fit, but be aware - not every one model of them will fit.  I was glad I took it to the store to test them!)  I chose 2 of the Chicco keyfit30.  They snap in easily without the adapters.  Can't wait to take the girls for a stroll in the park!",5,1

"HALO SleepSack Micro Fleece Swaddle Blanket, Print Girl, Newborn",I loved this so much I bought another one a couple days later.I swaddled her until she started to roll and then it was perfect to just wrap under her arms so her arms were free.I had read a sad comment about a baby who died at 7 months old being swaddled and not being able to free his arms once he had rolled over and suffocated. So I thought this option was great to be able to swaddle her as a young babe and continue to use this with her arms free for the remainder of the winter months.,5,1
"HALO Early Walker SleepSack Micro Fleece Wearable Blanket, Blue, Large","I loved these sleep sacks last winter, and I was so glad to find one that is big enough for my little guy now that he's almost a year older! I meant to order the large, based on the weight/size chart, but I accidentally ordered the medium, which is perfect. The medium fits my 21 pound son with lots of growing room (he's not especially tall). I think the large would've been laughably big.",5,1
"HALO SleepSack Micro Fleece Wearable Blanket, Print Boy, Small",we don't like warm rooms at night and when our little one kept knocking off the covers at night he was waking up crying from being cold.  easy to use and wash and keeps its look and shape perfectly.the fleece is thin but warm (baby doesn't need socks!) and seems to be comfortable.baby can stand up in crib with this on - we bought it a little larger to make sure he has extra room.,5,1

"okiedog Zugvogel - Document &amp; Passport holder - Urban,Grey","I had been looking for a passport/boarding pass wallet for quite a while.  I wanted something more creative than your average looking leather type.  I stumbled onto the Okiedog product and took a chance and even ordered a second one for my daughter.  I just received them today and they are awesome.  The are a little wider and longer than your average passport wallet, perfect for sliding in those printed boarding passes so they don't get lost in the bottom of your purse. I like the elastic closure, it's so easy compared to a zipper and will keep all my documents organized when I travel.  You will not be disappointed.  I only wish they offered a few more colors/styles.",5,1
The HERO Pocket Cloth Diaper (English Periwinkle) by Coqu&iacute; Baby,"This diaper is a great pocket!!! It has stayed unbelievably soft and fluffy for the few months that we've had it, and it fits super trim! I was skeptical at first with my long, skinny dude, but it really is great!

CTA Digital 2-in-1 iPotty with Activity Seat for iPad,"I'll just say in advance that the haters can judge me all they want. The fact of the matter is their real problem isn't with this product but with how they ASSUME it is going to be used. Guess what? I do NOT abandon my kid in the bathroom with the &#34;electronic babysitter.&#34; I sit with him and help him play the EDUCATIONAL games on the iPad which he loves. Some of which were RECOMMENDED by his SPEECH therapist to help with his articulation, btw. He's not just sitting there playing Angry Birds by himself while I'm off doing who knows what (not that there's anything wrong with Angry Birds, IMO).I have 3 kids, of whom the one using this potty is the youngest. However I was a nanny for 6 years before I was a mom so this is my SIXTH time potty training a kid (3 girls, 3 boys) and let me tell you I've learned a thing or two along the way. First and foremost, whenever possible, you should avoid forcing a kid to potty train (i.e. deciding that at 2yrs they need to train so you can get them into preschool and then forcing them to sit on the potty every 30 minutes). It just makes everyone miserable and rarely works as quickly or as well as if you simply wait for him/her to be ready. Second, every kid is different and you have to go with what works for THAT kid or again you are just making things miserable for both you and the kid.I won't go into detail on my nanny potty training experiences. Speaking to my own kids, though:  My oldest child didn't respond to ANY bribe/reward we offered. And believe me, we tried EVERYTHING (well, not anything negative, of course). Then one day he just decided he was done with diapers. Period. My middle child would use the potty just to get a sticker on his chart and a high-five from his mommy. Now, for the last year, my youngest has told us &#34;No&#34; in no uncertain terms every time we asked if he wanted to use the potty. No matter what bribe/reward we offered or what privileges we pointed out that he could gain by using the potty, he just didn't want to give it a try. UNTIL, on a whim, we offered the iPad. Once he figured out he could use the iPad if he used the potty, BINGO! He was perfectly happy, even eager to use the potty.Except daddy was nervous about having the iPad near the big toilet (frankly, Mommy wasn't too thrilled either since it was her iPad) and Mommy got tired of squatting in front of our son and holding the iPad. Literally. My legs were falling asleep. So I got online to look for a new little potty for him (big brothers had busted our old little one).  I figured with a little potty I could at least sit down fully on the floor with the iPad in my lap instead of squatting. That's when I stumbled across the iPotty.Aside from protecting the iPad and relieving me of the physical need to squat in front of him like a human TV tray, this potty has other great features.  First of all it fits my kid's butt & legs. And he's not a little tyke. He's 3 1/2 years old, but he's the size of a 4 1/2 year old in height and proportionate in weight.  However, his extra height and size are no problem for this potty. The seat itself is the right size (although I don't think an avg 2 yr old would fall in either) and there is plenty of room between the iPad stand and his knees (although to be honest, he's usually leaning back against the wall and sprawling his legs out in front of him - he's that comfortable).The biggest problem I have is getting him to keep his &#34;little part&#34; aimed into the toilet, partly because when he leans back, it pops up just slightly above the pee guard.  However that is NOT a fault of the pee guard. The pee guard is ample in size but not obtrusive and doesn't seem to bother him at all even when he leans forward against it. 9 times out of 10 the pee winds up in the right place even when he is leaning back just because of angle and the placement and size and shape of the pee guard. Oh, and the pee guard is firmly in there. No worries about it popping off like other potties I've used. The few times the pee escapes it's usually because he was fiddling with his &#34;little part&#34; and I didn't catch the aim problem fast enough. If he just sat up and didn't fiddle absentmindedly with his &#34;little part&#34; there would be no problem and the pee would be in the bucket every time. But boys will be boys.As for leaking, there is none. N.O.N.E. None. I have experience using 7 different potties besides this one. This is the ONLY one that had zero leak problems.This is by FAR the easiest to keep clean. For one thing, the pee actually goes into the bucket. It doesn't seep under the seat like with so many other models.  For another, the seat is smooth with no real crevices for nasties to hide and the whole thing is a cynch to clean with a simple Clorox wipe. Even when he has &#34;missed&#34; the pee has gone down the side (again because of the placement of the pee guard preventing forward aim) and there just aren't any hard places to wipe there. No need to dig out a toothbrush or even toothpick to clean out the small crevices like on other potties I've used. This potty's sleek design is more than just aesthetically appealing. It's practical. And let's just say that the pee somehow magically found its way to the base of the iPad stand (something that hasn't yet happened). All you would have to do is pop out an easily accessible pin (that little green thing at the base of the stand in the picture), lift the stand up, wipe the area and replace the stand and pin. Piece of cake.The only VERY minor disappointment was finding that, although he can navigate the touch screen with zero troubles, my son can't push hard enough through the plastic protective cover to activate the &#34;home&#34; button on the iPad. However, my son has fairly weak hands so an average child might have no problem with this. My older boys can push the button through the plastic no problem. That said, my little smarty figured out that at one point I had left one of the snaps undone on the side of the cover and he figured out that he could wiggle his little finger around and UNDER that edge of the cover to reach the &#34;home&#34; button that way. Problem solved. Now I leave that side unsnapped deliberately.  With the way the cover wraps around the stand, the iPad is still protected from &#34;poor aim&#34; (not that anything has ever made it that high) and we just wipe the &#34;home&#34; button with a sanitary wipe every now and then. Of course we also use a Clorox wipe on the protective cover. Speaking of the protective cover, it snaps directly to the stand and is a good fit. I have zero complaints about its design and no worries of it coming loose.Also of minor note, the child really can't have anything around their ankles and still straddle the stand the way they need to to sit on this potty. I suppose this could be an issue if you're running out the door, already have shoes and pants on, and don't want to slide the pants over one shoe to free up the legs. But we don't wear shoes in the house anyway, and my son really doesn't like having anything around his ankles, so this was a mute point for us.  *Maybe* you could keep the pants on if you kept the crotch at knee level instead of at the ankles, but I haven't tried it, so couldn't say for sure.Oh yeah, and assembly was such a piece of cake I almost forgot to mention it. The instructions made it clear what went where and while daddy was at work, I had this thing out of the box and assembled in well under 10 minutes. Possibly under 5. No tools required. Now that I've done it once, I could probably disassemble and reassemble the thing in under a minute. Seriously easy.I told my son the &#34;activity seat&#34; was a lid, btw. That feature won't get used till he's done needing it as an actual potty. It would just be too confusing and I see the activity stand as a reward for doing his business. It's amazing that the potty itself is used as the reward now thanks to the stand.  I mean, we still give him stickers on a chart and he likes that, but the iPad is what gets him to sit down in the first place. Without that I am convinced he would have lost interest long ago and I would have to be much more pushy about getting him to try. In fact, in the beginning, the few times the iPad's battery was depleted, it was a lot more difficult to convince him to sit on the potty. With the iPad working, it's just a matter of suggesting he try it and he agrees. No arguing, pleading, or persuading. Now that he's been doing it for about a week, he's spending less time on the potty and starting to recognize his urges sooner so that he is taking himself to the potty, doing his business, and getting off quickly to go play with his brothers more and more often. In other words, it's slowly becoming less about iPad time and more about doing his business and moving on. But the iPad is still what gets him to try when he's in the middle of playing and I realize it's about that time when he is likely to need to go again. No kid likes to stop playing to go sit on the potty.  This makes the decision easier for him and less stress on me.  I see absolutely no reason to feel guilty about that and I couldn't be happier about my purchase. :)What this potty doesn't do:  convert to a little seat for a grown-up potty or convert to a foot stool. BUT it doesn't promise to, either. This potty delivers on what it promises. You can't complain about something that was never promised and I have yet to find a potty that does those two things and does NOT leak. Not to mention the built in incentive of the iPad would be missing. So for me, it's worth the extra $ and bathroom square footage to buy a separate stool and eventually a little seat for the big toilet when he's ready for that transition. Actually I already have them and my &#34;little seat&#34; serves as a travel potty for hikes and road trips too, but that's another review.THANK YOU CTA Digital for creating the iPotty and offering it for sale to the public. You have made this potentially difficult transition easier for both myself and my child. :)",5,1
"Snuggin Go Therapeutic Infant Seating Support, Black",This is perfect for my special needs child!  He has transitioned from his infant carseat/stroller to a big boy one.

"Kinderville Little Bites Cups (Set of 2, Blue / Orange)","We bought both the Kinderville cups and bowls for our baby mostly because we learned that most other plastics aren't safe for children.  The cups and bowls are a perfect size for our 2-yr-old (We've used them since he was one).  He can easily hold the cups and, being silicone, they grip to the table a bit which has prevented some spills.  You won't be disappointed.",5,1
"Pocoyo Toddler Bedding Set, Multi",My son is 10 months old..loves Pocoyo....The fitted sheet fits his crib mattress perfect. The comforter is not plush or very high quality but just right for a little one. My son was so excited when he saw this set in his crib! We put the pillowcase and top sheet away for when he is in a toddler bed.,4,1
"RECARO Performance RIDE Convertible Car Seats, Vibe","We just got this a couple weeks ago and are in love with it. The fabric is light and our baby doesn't overheat like he would in a infant seat. We also purchase the Tiny Love-take along arch so he would have some toys on it and fits perfect. We have a SUV so it fits on our captain seat easily, we can still see the baby from the rear-view mirror. The only thing I personally have a problem with is it being a little big. I am 5 foot tall and with our SUV I have to climb to get little one out. Other than that, its very easy to install and adjust. Highly recommended!",4,1
"RECARO Performance SPORT Combination Harness to Booster, Vibe","We bought this for our 2 year old daughter (she turns 2 in 5 days)! I was worried since this was a booster/convertible car seat it would be too big/advanced/not secure enough (all the factors that go through our mommy brains) but the Recaro Performance Sports Booster conforms to her beautifully, she is SO secure and snug plus very very well protected with the side impact protection pads. I was also worried that the padding wouldn't be as thick because in the picture it does not look as 'thick' as the Recaro Proride car seat but let me tell you I also purchased that one for our 3 month old daughter and they are BOTH relatively the same amount of padding. I was so relieved to get them and see how beautiful the color was in real life, the pink is not so hot pink as it looks in the picture it is a nice soft pink. For the Proride we got the purple color and it is also a very nice deep purple. We had previously the Britax for our 2 yr old and In comparison to buckling and pulling the straps tight or loosening it is basically the same set up (you push down the little lever/button in the same spot on front of car seat just like the britax) but I would have to say the Recaro feels smoother to me. They are virtually the same in the aspect of getting them buckled but it feels easier to do so. In comparison to the Sport and Proride the only major difference I see which may be a factor for you is the strap protection piece for there neck is sewn into or part of the straps on the Sport seat and are removable on the Proride just like the Britax ones.Overall I was trying to debate whether or not to get the Sport or two of the Proride car seats for both of our daughters but I am so happy I chose to get her this Sport booster one for my 2 year old as it conforms to her perfect, she's comfortable and well protected PLUS she can grow with it! And by the time she is out of this, we can move our baby into this one... But that won't be a long ways down the road. I particularly love that these are higher then other car seats as we are not short people. I am 5'9 and my husband is 6'2 so our kids have always been in the 80-90th percentile for height! Happy car seat shopping, you won't be disappointed by this purchase!!! :)",5,1

"Munchkin Click LockDeluxe Snack Catcher, Blue/Green, 2-Count","I have always used & loved the Munchkin snack catchers with my son (now 4), but when my daughter came along (she's almost 2 now), I needed another snack solution. She kept peeling those other lids right off and dumping her snacks everywhere! I knew I needed something with a lid she couldn't remove. These cups have been absolutely perfect! We don't really use the lid attachment, and it's annoying that it comes off of its base so easily (because it's also the handle of the cup). But so far, she can't open these lids, so there's much less of a mess! I would highly recommend these.",5,1

"Innobaby Packin' Smart Five Tier Storage System, Blue/Clear","I was looking for a formula dispenser that was practical and didn't take up a whole lot of room. This is perfect. It comes with 5 compartments but since they come apart I can decide how many I will need when I go out, I love this versatility.",5,1

BRICA Seat Guardian Car Seat Protector,"I was given this product to review, and I love it! It fits perfectly with the booster seat my daughter uses and is very thick and durable. I don't have to worry about the seat of my car getting dirty or the carseat leaving any indents. This protects my leather upholstery very well. I would definitely recommend the Brica seat guardian car seat protector. I plan to purchase one for my son's car seat next!",5,1
BRICA Seat Guardian Car Seat Protector,"I don't always write reviews, but when I do, it's for something totally worth raving about! I purchased it for our new Honda Odyssey, to protect the leather seats. Not only is it sturdy, but it's well-built, covers the entire seat, and the color blends in with the color of our leather seats perfectly. Even if it wouldn't have blended in, the color itself is a very nice, neutral gray. After purchasing one, made another purchase for our new addition to the family. Totally worth it, don't waste your money on other carseat protectors!",5,1
BRICA Seat Guardian Car Seat Protector,"I use these in my new Altima with leather seats.  My Britex car seats fit perfectly into them,  They overlap the sides of the car seat and catch the crap my children drop.  They are of a sturdy hard material, and they keep the leather seats from creasing.",5,1
BRICA Seat Guardian Car Seat Protector,"This is an excellent car seat protector, right out the box you can tell is made of quality material love the shape and that it can be strapped to the head rest even thought I do not need that feature right now because is being used under a forward facing car seat, the Graco my ride 65 to be more specific but the back can be easily folded too for use with a rear facing car seat, it accommodates the seat perfectly this car seat protector is protecting my platinum leather in my Subaru Forester It will catch any spill or crumbs for easy cleaning is well designed, absolutely recommend it.",5,1
BRICA Deluxe Kick Mats (2 pack),"The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because there was a delay in shipping and I had to wait a bit longer than I was anticipating. However, the mats themselves work perfectly in my car and I am so thankful that someone thought to design them. I highly recommend purchasing them so you can perserve your seats as well.",4,1
BRICA Baby In-Sight Magical Firefly Auto Mirror for in Car Safety,One of my twin grandsons does not like to ride in the car very much. His brother immediately falls asleep and Aiden just cried. Bought this for him and it works perfectly. He needs lots of visual and auditory stimulation at times (comes from spending his first 3 months in the NICU and PICU) and this works perfectly. He can watch himself in the mirror and loves the music and fireflies.  What a great buy!,5,1
"BRICA By-My-Side Safety Harness Backpack, Pink/Gray","We have been using this just as a backpack and it's wonderful. It fits perfectly on a small child and really looks well. It holds our sons' bento-style lunch box, a sippy cup in the back, and my keys in the side. The backpack fits a bit more, but mostly I expect to use it for toys out on a walk or a trip. The backpack fits really nice on my son, couldn't ask for a better fit. Overall this is a really nice dual backpack / safety Harness. Well made, I expect it to last quite a long time.UPDATE: Washes well and looks like new. Cold wash and air dry.UPDATE: We've been using this for my son's Camelback bladder bag when out for a hike. It works fantastic as a small Camelback.",5,1
"Ju-Ju-Be Super Be Zippered Tote Diaper Bag with Pockets, Perfect Paisley",I love this Super Be!  I have several Ju Ju Be bags including a similar bag called the Mighty Be.  I love this one bc it has a zipper at the top and mesh pockets on the inside to stay organized.  You can't say that this bag isn't big enough bc there is tons of room.  Love the new color too!! Awesome job JJB!,5,1
"Ju-Ju-Be Super Be Zippered Tote Diaper Bag, Pink Pinwheels",I really like the super be because it has a zipper on top so all your items can be secured unlike the mighty be. It's also a little bigger than the mighty be. I won't carry it as an everyday tote or diaper bag. It's a little too big for daily use. But it's perfect for when we go on a trip to Europe with our three kids. I will be taking both the super be and the mighty be and keep them folded in the luggage so I can use them there when we rent a car and travel between different countries. They will be perfect for toting around anything we want for the kids since we are going to leave our main luggage at my cousins house for ease of transportation. It also has 2 mesh pockets inside to keep it more organized.,5,1

Fisher-Price Newborn-to-Toddler Portable Rocker,Great little seat. My 3 month old son loves it. I like the fact that you can adjust it as they grow. it would be perfect but my only gripe is that the music controls are by his feet and he constant kicks his heals against it so I have to cushion it with a soft blanket.,4,1

"Baby Jogger Car Seat Adapter Single, Mounting Bracket","My husband and I bought the Baby Jogger Summit X3 stroller and a Chicco Keyfit 30 Magic infant car seat.  We bought this adapter to be able to use the Summit as a travel system instead of the traditional, clunky travel system stroller that is &#34;supposed&#34; to go with the Chicco Keyfit car seat.Word of warning:  There are MULTIPLE sets of directions for different brands of car seats.  I originally hadn't notice this and used the first set of (Graco) directions to install the adapter and became very frustrated when my Chicco seat wouldn't click in to the adapter.  I Googled like crazy, and eventually found another review that mentioned this same thing.  Once I used the correct directions, which involved removing a couple of brackets from the adapter, the car seat fits in perfectly and clicks in easily every time.  It is a little pricey compared to adapters for other brands of strollers, but now that I have installed it properly I think it is worth the price.",5,1
"Baby Jogger Car Seat Adapter Single, City Select/City Versa","I bought this to use with my Chicco keyfit 30.  It works great!  The carseat clicks in securely.  You can wiggle it around a little bit but it seems pretty secure so far.  I've been using it for 3 months now, since my son was a newborn, on the City Select with a second seat for my 2 year old in the lower seat position.  I can still use the canopy on the lower seat with the carseat attached.  I can also use the parent console with the carseat attached though it does fit better when the stroller handle is pulled all the way out.  I read some reviews about the keyfit being inclined too much with this adaptor but when my carseat is attached, the line on the carseat is parallel to the ground, as it is supposed to be in a car.  So based on that, the incline is perfect.  My son never had a problem with it, even when he was just a few days old.  I wish this wasn't so expensive, but it does the job and turns my city select into the perfect double stroller for an infant and toddler.",4,1
"NUK Fashion Learner Cup, Boy, 5 Ounce","I have been searching for a new sippy cup for my daughter and this is perfect. We had been using Playtex sippy cups but the valves would start to wear after use and cause the cup to leak from the air holes. This cup is perfect because it does not require a valve and is airtight. For a teething baby, the soft spout is just another added bonus. Would recommend this cup to any parent looking a cup that is leak-proof, teether friendly and easy to hold and use.",5,1
"NUK Fashion Orthodontic Bottle, Blue Elephants, Boy, 10 Ounce, 3-Count","I choose the NUK bottles because they have cute outlook, and the nipple is very soft,it's perfect for the babies,especially the newborn, besides, the bottleneck is wide enough to add the powder in, I will recommend it!",5,1

We have had tons of different car seats over the years and this is the LAST!  I finally found it.",5,1

Fits my grandson perfectly and safely...I highly recommend this seat!",5,1

"Diono Ultra Mat Full-Size Seat Protector, Black","These fit perfectly in the rear seat of our 07 Suburban under our Britax 70-G3.  Covers the whole seat bottom.  It won't contain anything spilled, but  none of them really do anyway.  The full back of the seat is covered, so with our seat currently rear facing, it is perfect.  Very pleased, and great value too.  It does exactly what it is designed for.",5,1

Graco Size4Me 70 Convertible Car Seat (Aries),"I bought this seat at Target today and I took it out and installed it in moments.  If it was for an infant it would require some adjusting.  I had a Safety 1st convertable seat from when my son was about 4-5 months to now.  Although his seat was great, he just looked so big in it. He fits perfectly into this seat and it surrounds him. I feel much better having him in this seat!",5,1
myBaby SoundSpa Sleepy Snail Projection Light and Noise Machine,"I ordered this for my Granddaughter and she absolutely loves it. It plays different lullabies, has different sound effects and has strobing lights(that you can adjust brightness) as well as a ceiling projector.It arrived on time and in perfect condition.The only suggestion I could make is that I wish it had an AC cord along with a battery option.Great product.",5,1
"Lambs &amp; Ivy BFF Bumper, Snoopy",I was hesitant because if the price but it was well worth it. Very adorable and fit the nursery perfectly. I do recommend this for anyone doing a snoopy theme nursery.,5,1
"Delta Children's Products Sophia 3 in 1 Crib, Expresso Latte",This crib is perfect for my little Flutter Fly!!!! It is a gorgeous color and easy to put together. I suggest having at least 2 people to put it together though. It is very beautiful.,5,1
"Lambs &amp; Ivy BFF Lamp with Shade, Snoopy",We absolutely LOVE this lamp!  Our nursery is Baby Snoopy themed and this lamp fits in so well with our other Lambs & Ivy products.  We have the older Peek a Boo Snoopy nursery set from 2009 and this blends in perfectly with it.  Couldn't be happier with this.,5,1
"Sugarbooger Good Lunch Snack Container, Hoot, 4-Count",There are perfect for my daughters finger foods and snacks I send to daycare with her:) had them for a few months and they are great!,5,1
"Sugarbooger Good Lunch Box Divided Lunch Container, My Garden","Love this. Does everything I need it to and is the perfect size.  Runny foods will leak between compartments if tipped, but most containers will do that. No plastic smell. Just be careful about using a scrubby when washing the design - it will scratch it.",5,1
"Sugarbooger Peek-A-Boo Silverware Set, Orange Slice","great set of toddler silverware,  the bowl of the spoon and size of the fork is actually deeper but smaller compared to the other  toddler silverware sets from sugarbooger, which i prefer - it's the perfect size for my 3-year-old daughter.  although the company says to hand wash these only, we've thrown these in the dishwasher and they've come out fine.  i do wish the container they came with had the magnetic lock like the other sugarbooger utensil sets.",4,1
"Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 5 (2 Pink, 2 Purple, 1 White)","I give them 4 stars because there's nothing wrong with them, but they are truly unnecessary! I bought these when I first started cd'ing but quickly found that I didn't need them. I trifold my prefold, and fan out the front and back so that the sides reach each other then put my Thirsties cover over it and it stays perfectly in place. I sold them since I don't use them. I like the girl colors though :)",4,1
Lorex Video Baby Monitor,"Bought months ago and have been using it for nearly three months now. Love it and would highly recommend it to parents! This is perfect for us!****Update****So we still use our Lorex every day and happy with everything else except one thing.You have to keep your monitor plugged into your computer the entire time you're viewing from Skype.This doesn't work for us at all. One of the reasons we got this baby monitor is because when my husband is away (he is in the military) he can hop on whenever he'd like and see our baby while she is sleeping (or playing) in her crib. This doesn't work at all because in order for the monitor to be plugged in, it takes away the viewing for me. So he can view it via skype, but I cannot. Also, it must stay plugged in at all times during skype call. Since I don't know when/if my husband will be able to call, it's nearly impossible for me to know when to plug it in for him to view. All in all, completely worthless for that purpose. If someone is using it for their home when they're away for vacation or a business, then it may be beneficial. But for our situation, it is not.",4,1
Tommee Tippee Single Electric Breast Pump,"I bougt the breast pumpnfoe my friend who had just delivered and she bhas no regrets, the pump Works perfect,looks perfect and she highly recommends it.",5,1
Aqueduck Faucet Handle Extender,"Perfect for my kiddos! This arrived yesterday and the kids love it.Having a step stool next to the sink enabled them to reach the sink basin, but they still couldn't reach the water or faucet. The extender fits tight with a squishy sponge material that grips the handle. A screw piece clamps the two sides together. The screw piece felt a little flimsy so I tightened only until it felt like it wouldn't fall off. I didn't want to over tighten it and break it.I bought this in combination with the faucet extender and now my 2.5 year old is pretty self sufficient in the bathroom.",5,1
"ERGObaby  Original Infant Insert, Galaxy Grey","I ordered this insert unsure if I'd actually need it as my baby girl is 3 1/2 months old, 14lbs, & has great head & neck control. We tried it out & I'm so glad I ordered it! She is a bit to small for her legs to fit comfortably w/out the insert & sits just low enough in the carrier that she can't see out. The insert makes her fit perfectly! It also has a removable pillow that you can use without the insert to help them sit more comfortably & higher in the carrier once the insert isn't really needed. The insert can be folded over the top of the carrier to make it more comfortable on the back of her head. She still has plenty of room to move & look around w/out being squished in the carrier & against me. So glad I purchased this!!!!",5,1

"Manhattan Toy Go Push Toy, Puppy","I got this push toy for my grandson because it reminded me of the larger inch work riders we had as children that required you to push down in the center of the toy to make it go. Albeit, this one is a fraction of the size of the rider toy, it is perfect for young toddlers to help develop simple motor skills, due to the fact that you have to push down on the center to make it roll forward on its own. It can freely roll by giving it a nudge forward. As well, it doesn't move super fast, so your toddler can retrieve it quickly, even the crawlers. It's a cute design made of hard plastic, small enough and well made enough so that when the chewers get tired of pushing it, and decide to gnaw on its nose or wheels, haha, you won't have to worry about them swallowing anything, granted, that's not what we want them doing with this toy. All in all, it's a great little toy to can hold your toddler's interest for quite some time.",4,1

Juniorbeads Jane Jr. Necklace - Cherry Red,"We love these. We bought a bigger pair for my 7-year-old with ASD, and he chewed on the clasp and on the oblong beads until they broke. This smaller necklace is PERFECT for him. Highly recommend them for kids with oral needs!",5,1
"Graco Nautilus Elite 3-in-1 Car Seat, Vice","I bought this seat for my husbands truck, a Toyota Tundra 2003 with an access cab. The seats in the back sit almost at a 90 degree angle and most convertible car seats have an angle to them that made them not fit. This seat's back is a pretty straight line and was the perfect match. It was super easy to put together, with clear English instruction manual, but also included a Espa&ntilde;ola one. My 18 month old fits snugly in it (but enough growing room), and he seems to be very comfortable. I have noticed readers dislike it because the plastic chest latches are hard to undo. I have found this is true IF you try to do it in its normal position. I think this is to make it child proof, because when you loosen the whole belt and angle up and towards the chest they unclip easily. The only complaint I have is how the entire belt system tightens. My other car seat is a Recaro ProRide and the belt on it will tighten VERY tight and easily, where as this one seems like it just puts pressure down on the shoulders as it tightens. This leaves a gap between the belly/chest area. I have to pull the tightening strap as I pull out and up on the chest piece, readjust the chest piece down, tighten it some more, readjust down, and tighten again, then fix the chest piece in its right location. After doing all that I feel it sits properly and snugly where it should be.",4,1

Beaba Open Diaper Bag - Spacious Bag That Lets You See Everything - Blue,"opens 180 degrees so that you don't have to dig to bottom of the bag.Stylish bag that is deceptively large. Able to pack baby's stuff and some of mine in when needed with plenty of room to spare.I ordered the grey colored bag. I love the simple look of it because it doesn't scream diaper bag but it is on the plain side, which again, I like. The material is a nice, sturdy cotton. Like a soft canvas of sorts. The lighter grey will eventually show stains but I presume washing is fairly easy.My favorite is all the pocket space! Great outside space on both sides and hidden pockets inside for extra storage and organization. This is perfect for traveling with baby toiletries like meds and diaper cream, etc.It comes with a few cute extras like a travel sized changing pad, a little bag for dirty laundry, a bottle bag and a little zippered keychain sized bag to keep a pacifier clean and handy.If you are looking for a functional, no frills diaper bag that can probably carry more than most if needed, this is for you. Plus, I think less is more, so it's stylish to me. :)",5,1
Baby Jack Blankets Cow Spots Lovey,I love giving baby jack lovies as new baby gifts! New parents appreciate such a thoughtful and unique present. Babies love the textures and tabs and get comfort from such a perfectly sized blankie. A baby jack lovie is a must for infants and toddlers.,5,1
"Dapper Snapper Baby &amp; Toddler Adjustable Belt- Boy's Colors: Navy, Beige and Black","Our son is 3 and skinny, and has trouble fitting into the TONS of 3T pants/shorts he has.  The 2Ts were a little tight, so nothing really worked.  This is an awesome little invention - totally overpriced (if you're thrifty, you could probably make a dozen of the same thing for about $5 worth of materials at the fabric store) but since I have no time or desire to DIY it, these are perfect.If you have a sewing machine and some crafty aptitude, I would suggest buying just one of these, and using it as a template to make your own.",5,1
"Dapper Snapper Baby &amp; Toddler Adjustable Belt- Boy's Colors: Navy, Beige and Black",I was told about this product from a fellow Facebook group member. We all have kids who are small for their age. These help us use pants that are the right length but have too big of a waist for our kids. My son can now wear pants that have been sitting in his drawers for months. I am thrilled that they work. I wonder if they can add more snaps in the middle between the two snaps for more versatility. Sometimes it tightens some pants too tight or too loose. It does work perfectly for some pants too so it is worth the money.,4,1
Paci-Plushies Buddies - Patches Puppy Pacifier Holder,These little guys are adorable and the perfect size! I bought one for my niece and she LOVES it! Great company and products :),5,1
Paci-Plushies Shakies - Turtle Rattle,"I bought this for my five month old a few months ago.  I bought it because I love the interchangeable pacifiers.  My big issue with the wubanub is I feel I never get the pacifier clean.  With this I simply pop out her favorite pacifier (the nuk) and pop in another.  She absolutely loves it.  Turtle is now her safety object in the car, she wants him with her in the car seat, ever if it's not in her mouth.  He's large, plush, and if she's upset I can jingle the little rattle and she calms right down.  She even got upset when her year old cousin took it from her the other day.  I also love that it's large enough to help her get the pacifier back in her mouth.  She's not quite coordinated enough to out a pacifier back in, but with this, she can.Another reviewer mentioned that the plastic is rather hard and so it &#34;pops out&#34; of baby's mouth.  This was true a) when I first got it and b) when she was smaller.  It has since softened a little (maybe because it's gone through the washer a few times) and she's also larger so it doesn't pop out.  I would say it might be a little more awkward with a young baby, but it's perfect for my daughter at 5 months and has been for a while.Overall I love it and she hates to be without it.  I actually have two now in case one is in the wash.  Oh, and we have the dragon as well, but she likes the turtle a lot more.",5,1
KidCo Peapod Plus - Kiwi,"Perfect for when my one year old grandson comes to sleep over at Grammie's house!  So portable and convenient!

Baby Trend Activity Walker,"My little man lOVES his walker and he spends a lot of time over at grandmas house while we are working. it is easily portable, but we have enough baby stuff to cart from home to grandmas and from grandmas to home, so my mom wanted to buy him a walker just for her house. we went to walmart to get one and when we got home he couldnt even reach the floor on the lowest setting. My baby isnt a shorty either hes been 75%-90% in his percentile and at 6 months he couldnt reach in a couple different walkers that walmart had to offer. At home i had the bear walker from baby trend so i suggested that we buy the same one online. Both this walker and the bear one work perfect and hes been in the bear one since he was 4 months and not at 9 months he still carts around in it. Also this walker has bads under the base and it prevents them from going down a dip or up a dip.",5,1

Felt like I was trying to ride a bike for the first time.This stroller is a beast. Plays your music, folds and is great to jog with. Why the 4 stars then? The aux cable that you plug your phone into to enjoy music isnt the best. There is some static to it (using anything) until you bend it into that perfect position. Other than that this thing is great and I get nothing but compliments. Easy to fold/store is also a bonus.",4,1
"Jeep Adventure Jogging Stroller, Black","Love this stroller and so does my 1 year old. Looked a while for the perfect stroller and this is definitely it. I love how far the canopy comes down to protect my child's face from wind, and I love the shocks that keep the ride smooth no matter what you ride over. I would definitely buy this stroller again.",5,1
Bananafish Peacock Blue Mobile,this does the trick. I wish the tune lasted longer but I think that is an issue with any mobile. The peacocks are a little funky looking (kinda like blue turkeys!) but it matches the bed set perfectly so no big deal. Easy to install. I've been using it for 5 1/2 weeks and love it!,4,1
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Newborn Rock N Play Sleeper, My Little Sweetie","This is my most favorite baby gear product by far!!! It is the perfect recline and is snuggly for my sweet girl. She loves sleeping in it or playing in it, and I will never have another newborn in my home without one.",5,1
Uniden G403 4.3-Inch Baby Monitor with Internet and Indoor Portable Camera (G403),"It isn't perfect, but it is by far the best thing available on the market.  I spent months researching and comparing, and have found no match to the screen size and mobile app accessibility offered by this monitor.  To get a better online viewing experience you would have to spend hundreds more for a security system.I didn't realize until after semi-permanently mounting the camera that it actually runs on battery as well, so we now plan to buy an additional camera to use around the house for nap/play monitoring outside the nursery.  I also covered the light on the camera with a piece of tape and it is now barely visible as an indicator and does not light the room at all.  It is odd that the older unit had two-way talk and lullabies that this one lacks, but then again I could never imagine taking to our son remotely or playing music would save us any trips to the nursery.My only real complaint is the lack of sound when viewing remotely, but the quality is great on the iPad and it's not like you're the primary watcher if you are viewing remotely away from home.  I can see the wired network connection being an issue for some, but this seems to be standard for most consumer-grade network-ready automation/monitoring devices.Overall, after a year of use we still love this monitor and have no regrets about waiting until this hit the market just in time last year.",5,1
"OXO Tot Cutlery Set for Big Kids, Aqua","This set could probably also be used by a 2 year old and could certainly be used by any child up to pre-teens, but 3-5 seems to me the perfect age for this. That's when kids are transitioning away from from the &#34;baby&#34; cutlery and this set is just the perfect size- also extremely well made, pretty, durable, etc. Recommend very highly.",5,1
18&quot; Pouf Ottoman Floor Pillow Grey White Elephant,"I bought this to use along with my nursing chair since it came without anything to put my feet up, the theme is turquoise and gray elephants and it looks beautiful. The ottoman is sturdy, height is perfect for my feet and stays in place.I love this rather than an ugly $300+ ottoman that I cannot get use of later... This one will become a piece for ages.",5,1
"Gund Baby 8&quot; Sock Hop Chime Plush Toy, Ribbitz Frog",Our month-old granddaughter was immediately attracted to the bright colors and soft chime.

I love this fabric, in the winter keeps baby warm and in the summer keeps her the right temp and does not over heat her. This blanket is also soo big she will have it for years to come.... it also gets softer with every wash.",5,1
"Britax 2013 B-Agile Stroller, Granite","So, when it comes to strollers I probably am a bit of a hoarder. I love to have the perfect stroller for every occasion. I have had just about every brand, style, and color of stroller you can imagine. I absolutly LOVE this stroller. I love the design, how light it is and how easy to fold it is (even grandpa could do it!) and of all the strollers I have owned (somewhere over 8 when I stopped counting, mind you I only have two kids!) this is by far my favorite. I love the bright green color (I let my two year old pick which color she wanted!) but most of all I love how well this stroller works for just about every situation we get into. It worked wonderfully on slightly rough playground areas, and was a dream to manuver in a busy mall. My two year old has never slept in the stroller, ever, and the very first day we used this she curled up and slept for over two hours while we walked the zoo! I wish I would have bought this stroller sooner, and wish they had it over six years ago when I had my first. Might have saved myself several hundreds on all those others. Even my now 6.5 year old can ride comfortably (I do have smaller kiddos, so she is under the 55lb weight limit).",5,1
COZY BABY NASAL ASPIRATOR - This Snot Sucker Cleans Away Baby's Blocked Nose FAST - Its The Best Nasal Suction Tool On The Market To Relieve Blocked Nasal Congestion Quick - No Filters - Washable And Reusable - Great Baby Shower Gift - 100% Money Back Guarantee.,"We are thrilled with this nose cleaner. It worked the first time perfectly, no discomfort to our new baby at all, and with the three cleanable cups that come with it, there is no pressure on us to to clean a used one immediately.The baby had no reaction to our using it, and still time after time, it removes more than the other two types we had, and the others two didn't work half as well as this one and it caused the baby and us discomfort since they were not easy to use.I can't imagine anyone not liking this product unless perhaps a factory defect were to slip through, but it sure doesn't seem likely..",5,1

My 2 and 5 year old were kicking the back of the seats all of the time. So, I found these online and they work really well. They fit perfectly on both seats, were easy to put on, and protect the seats. I love that you can tighten the top strap since my 2 year old tends to kick the top part of the seat. I just raised the mat higher for her! I am so happy that I ordered these.BTW, I have a Toyota Highlander SUV and they fit perfectly!",5,1
Beco Baby Carrier Soleil Accessory Pack (Metro Black),"The infant insert is necessary when you have a smaller baby, and this has worked perfectly for us. The I nsert is very secure and my daughter falls asleep after a few minutes in the carrier.  We have not used the drool pads, since she is to little, maybe when she is bigger. I'm not sure why this comes with the hood piece, because the carrier already had one, so now we have two.",4,1

"Prince Lionheart pottyPOD Basix, Gumball Green","Potty training is a challenge and the large toilet can be intimidating for a toddler. The pottyPod, is perfect for my grandson Jasper, comfortable to his size giving him the confidence he needs for this new experience in his life. I recommend putting a plastic grocery bag  as a liner for a quick clean-up. This makes a great baby shower gift, or a special gift for the toddler ready to take on the task. Durable, easy to clean and comfortable. I highly recommend it.",5,1
KidCo Peapod - Cranberry,"LOVE IT we just traveled with our 8 month old and this was perfect in the hotel room that had no crib, great on the beach, light weight and super easy to pack in the suit case and it's big enough so we can use it for a couple years as she grows",5,1
KidCo Peapod - Cranberry,"I love amazon reviews and was very shocked when I read the previous model's review by a woman whose son died while in the unit. Her credentials are valid. She used her real name, has a photo of herself, has other reviews that seem fair and was by no means a troll just trying to scare people about some competitors product. I feel...sick and horribly saddened for her loss and my pain for her held me off from buying for a few weeks until I read up on the changes made and other reviews. While the unit was in transit, I was actually stressed, thinking, &#34;am I a horrible mother, subjecting my child to death?!&#34; Well, the unit came today and i believe that the redesign was successful. Any movement that would put a child up against the wall will in no way block air to the child. It is completely mesh and air flow is great. Additionally the mattress pad is attached underneath the entire pod which means that it cannot move around inside and bunch up and provide a suffocation risk. As for the floor of the unit presenting a suffocation risk, I believe that it mimics the structure of a crib bedding. My crib has a plastic coated mattress with a sheet on it. Although there is no sheet here, it's the same concept.  I still would never recommend the first model and I still find that mom's review 100% valid. That beings said, I am very happy that I bought this.Other things I like... I didn't really realize that the unit literally pops up when you open the elastic straps. I thought you had to assemble it like a tent. This is fantastic and it eliminates user error.  Not to mention, the size! The size is perfect for air travel. No pack and play! (Which my kid hates because it has a wobbly floor)As for moms who have concern with their kid hating it and refusing to be in it. Here is what I did. I popped it open in the living room. The I got super excited and showed my kid a new toy that I put inside it. Later I put her bottle on the floor in there and she climbed in on her own and laid down to drink it and then continued playing.  I zipped it up and kept close by to let her know it was safe and good to be in there.  I left it our living room for a few days before our trip and she had no problems with it.",5,1

Kids Travel Play Tray - Childrens Car Seat Buggy Pushchair Lap Tray (Red),"I purchased this tray for my four year old Son to use. While it's made of completely soft materials, it's firm and sturdy. The cup holder is deep enough for my Son's thermos and stable enough to hold a cup without it tipping over. The buckle strap is large and easily adjustable and adds an extra measure of stability. The barrier around the tray keeps snacks in. The material is easy to clean. My Son got ketchup on it and it wiped away, easily. Also? The fabric cover is easy to take off, the foam inserts are firm enough to put back into the tray, after the material is washed. The pockets on the side are deep and mesh. They're a little too deep and low hanging for my kiddo to get his hands into to retrieve toys but, that's while he's in his car seat. I haven't used it on our umbrella stroller yet but, I know that when I do, it's going to work perfectly! I only wish I had purchased this sooner! I think this will be my go to baby gift in the future!",5,1

Car Storage Organizer Is Perfect to Organize Travel Road-trips, Soccer, Baseballs, and All the Summer Activities for Babies, Toddler, and Teens",I read through review after review and took a chance on this because it was highly rated. It has lived up to those ratings as it was easy to install and the long bottom cord allows for my son to have plenty of foot area without the organizer banging into his legs. He can reach everything and it has lots of pockets for him to store his &#34;treasures&#34;.,5,1
Circo Ladybug Fabric Drawer,"Mrs. Boyer here.  Ordered these storage cubes for my little girl's nursery and I just adore them.  Sturdy & roomy & perfect for storing all the miscellaneous baby stuff that inevitably needs a home, like tiny little rattles, toys & burp cloths.  They fit on a standard sized bookshelf, which is nice--no special &#34;cube storage&#34; furniture required.  I got two and intermixed with the Circo Owl fabric drawer and plain colored Closet Maid storage cubes in green & yellow to create the perfect complement to the nursery decor.  Love them!",5,1
"phil&amp;teds Universal Travel Bag, Black","The travel bag holds a ton.  More then I thought it could.  We packed it with a fold down full size bassinet from our Uppa Baby Stoller, 4 packs of 72 count diapers, Uppa Baby Vista Car seat, and a boppy.  The bag comes with velcro that is really strong that is attached to the bag.  It also comes with additional straps that velcro down.  When we stuffed this bag we were at the very end of the velcro connecting.  We were worried as we were traveling from the West Coast to India and back and with very little velcro keeping it closed... It did perfectly fine and did not open up.  The other great feature is that the inside of the bag has a sort of nylon bag that cinches your items together when you put it in the bag.  The cinch to the nylon internally attached bag will not encase all your items but does ensure they will not come out of the edges of the bag.  The wheels are ok, inline skate type wheels on the lower end; you can not pull this far with any weight without having some issues of drag, but it is pull able.  The strap to pull it with is nylon material so as long as the weight is low I think it would work fine and would be easy on your hand, we did take this to the extreme.Airline Tip:  Airlines usually put your stroller on for free, since this bag can exceed some size limits on airlines, stuff it full and tell them it is your stroller at check in.  They are not going to open it up.  Then bring your stroller to gate check.",4,1
Carter's Boys 2pk Swaddle Blanket,I was so happy that I was able to find these. They are a great cotton swaddling blanket. My baby absolutely loves to cuddle these and chew on them now at 4 months. They were perfect for swaddling when he was a baby as well,5,1

"Nursery Fresh Refill for Diaper Genie 4 Pack, 1,088 Count","I was reluctant to buy these at first because I had only been buying Diaper Genie brand refills, but thought I would try them out because they were cheaper. I'm so glad I did, because these work just as well, if not better, than the name brand refills. They fit our Diaper Genie perfectly, and contain the poop diapers very well. No smell whatsoever when the Diaper Genie is closed.Bags are also very sturdy - I haven't had anything fall apart on me yet. The Diaper Genie brand, however, has ripped on me more than a few times.Would highly recommend!",5,1
"Nursery Fresh Refill for Diaper Genie 4 Pack, 1,088 Count","I got these because of the price. I thought &#34;how bad could this be&#34;? I have to say that you notice the fact that it is longer. The feeling was that the diapers would smell less since I use this. I then checked the features and it does have more layers. I don't notice the difference in thickness as other reviewers did. I use it on the Diaper Genie basic model and it fits perfectly. The inner diameter is a bit smaller than Playtex and I tend to hit it when disposing the diapers, however it is not a big deal.",5,1
Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature Perfect Prep Formula Machine,"Formula moms are generally not encouraged but many of us cannot breastfeed.  Tommee Tippee gets that.  My son was born with a cleft lip that hindered my breastfeeding capabilities, which was hard enough to deal with without all the judgement and stink eyes!  The Perfect Prep is SO absolutely amazing.  It prepares bottles at the perfect temperature/consistency.  It totally eliminates the need for a bottle warmer (unless you are thawing/heating refrigerated breast milk, which I am not anymore).  It filters water and the ""hot shot"" sterilizes and kills any bacteria in the formula.  I feel great giving my baby these bottles and he's thrilled with the body temperature... sends him right off to dreamland.  This is a must for any mom not exclusively breastfeeding!",5,1
Precious Bassinet Liner/Skirt &amp; Hood color: White - Size: 17inch x 31inch,This fit perfect on a 32 yr old bassinet.  The bow is a little cheapie but it has a Velcro to it so you can always change it out with one with color instead of white on white. The holes on the sides of both pieces were within location to fit perfectly as well. This was surely worth the money.,4,1

"Stephan Baby Ultra Soft and Huggable Plush My First Teddy Bear, Pink","My granddaughter asked me for a pink teddy bear for her third birthday. This is the one I chose and it was perfect. She loved it. Very soft and huggable. The only think I was a little disappointed in was the color was a very light pink, I thought it would be alittle darker. But my granddaughter didn't care, so it wasn't a big deal. Very good value for the price.",5,1

Lavender and White Suzanna Toddler Bedding 5pc Set by Sweet Jojo Designs,"I have used this toddler bedding for a few weeks now. The colors are just as pictured and the quality is great. I washed all the sheets as soon as I recieved them and they held up well in the washer and dryer. My daughter loved the print(though she is only 22months) she smiled so big when I put them on her bed. She is still in a crib, I haven't converted the crib into a toddler bed just yet. But the sheets fit perfectly and I can tuck the comforter around the mattress so in the middle of the night when she moves around the comforter still stays in place. Very happy with my purchase.",5,1
Zoli Baby Bunny Teether - Orange,"My son was born 3 months early and had many complications after birth.  As a result, he has coordination difficulties and has a tough time getting most teethers into his mouth.  This teether is the perfect shape for him as he can easily hold it and the 'ears' are long enough that he can get them into his mouth on his own.  He is currently teething, but as of yet has no teeth, and this teether is both soft and stimulating for his gums.  I would definitely recommend this to parents of babies with developmental delays!",5,1
"OXO Tot Roll Up Bib, Aqua","I bought this for my 15 month old daughter. She feeds herself with a mix of her hands and her own spoon or fork, and I was looking for something that would catch all of the bits that don't make it, especially for the messier things like oatmeal and tomato sauce. I was happy enough with it to buy a second and stop looking for another option, but it's not perfect.Pros:  cute, easy to clean (wipe or rinse), seems comfortable (she can definitely take it off herself, but generally doesn't), catches a lot of the food and soupier spills.Cons: We still generally need do an outfit change after meals. Her sleeves, even pushed up, usually end up a bit dirty, and while the pocket catches a good 90% of the dropped food, that's still 10% for pants.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Lakeland 5 Drawer Dresser, Snow White",It was hard to put together and it did take a long time but that's the trade-off for buying something inexpensive. Hopefully will be able to use it for 10 years as the look is perfect.,4,1
"Bumkins Waterproof Zippered Wet/Dry Bag, Blue Owl",This is a great bag.  It has a nice design and made of nice material.  I like that I can separate the wet from the dry in two separate compartments.  My only complaint is that I would like it to be a little bigger.  I still would recommend this product and think it does its job perfectly.,5,1
"Summer Infant 3D lite Convenience Stroller, Black","This is a great stroller.  Looks snazzy.  The seat lays almost flat which is handy for my 6 month old when we are out during nap time.  I used the stroller in the winter, and had no issues navigating the slippery slushy parking lots, but can't speak to use outside of pavement and stores.The cup holder is handy, and there is a pocket on the back of the canopy that was perfect for holding my phone while out and about.  The basket is a good size, but not quite big enough for a diaper bag when the seat is reclined.  The stroller was easy to put together, but folding and unfolding are a bit tricky at first.  My husband didn't think that the handles came out far enough from the stroller causing his feet to occasionally bump the bottom when walking.I especially love the strap for carrying the stroller.  At 5 ft I was able to carry the stroller on my shoulder and my 17 lb kid in the rain with no issues.  Where the harness snaps together is covered, which is great for keeping little fingers out, but can get in the way when trying to get in and out quickly in the rain/snow.Disclosure: I was given a free sample of this product to review. However, my opinions are my own.",4,1

Baby Diaper milk Bottle Divider Storage Bag White L Size,"As a mom of five, I have had a lot of diaper bags.  Most diaper bags have pockets along the sides and a vast center space for diapers, extra clothing, etc.  Try as I might, I always end up with a mess of items floating around the bag, leaving me to fumble around for a burp cloth or some other needed item.  This divider has solved my problem, I wish I had it with all of my previous diaper bags.  I have the wipes and diapers in one of the large pockets that are on the ends, I have the changing pad rolled up and stuffed in one of the middle sections, along with a sling carrier, burp cloths, and a nursing cover in each of their own sections.  The other large end pocket is perfect for a change of clothes, plus I have an extra section or two for a water bottle/wallet.  It is a bit flimsy, if you shove items in the sections, it will collapse, but if you slip the items nicely into the sections, the divider holds it shape just fine!  I highly recommend this to save time and your sanity!",4,1

Snug Square Play Mat (Cream-Espresso),"I recently saw this product at Big City Mom's Baby Shower in Miami. I immediately knew I must have one! I own a small preschool and the 2 year olds do yoga, but have a hard time staying on their little yoga mats.  This soft, plush and perfectly sized playmat is the perfect solution. What a brilliant concept! I was fortunate enough to win it from a raffle at the event. The moment I brought it home my children ages 2 and 7 fell in love with it. I cannot keep them off it - they have been dancing on it and my daughter now sleeps on it for a 'camp out' in her bedroom. Bravo!!! This one will not be leaving my house. Time to order another one for my school....",5,1
Snug Square Play Mat (Cream-Espresso),"I love the mat. I got it for my 3 months and she basically uses it most of the day ( perfect for tummy time, playtime). it looks beautiful in my living room, so I keep it open and if the 3 month old is not using it, my older kids are always excited to use it.",5,1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier One, Black, Cotton","Our daughter was born in July 2013, and BabyBjorn One was just released in Japan. After reading various reviews for other carriers, we took the plunge and bought the BB One. Out daughter is now 7 1/2 months now, and we are really happy with the purchase.I really like all the adjustments you can make to optimize the fit for the baby's size and position. Technology-wize, it is really a step ahead of everyone else. I am 6ft (184 CM), and my wife is tiny at 5ft. And the carrier works for both of us. We have not needed to buy any other carriers.The kid loves it too, especially the forward facing position. She loves to go outside and look at everything. Then after a while (30 minutes) she comfortably falls asleep. I have had her in it for 5 hours (with breaks) in the parent facing position, with no issues.Things I like1. I like all the adjustments you can do to get the optimal position for newborns, all the way up to toddlers.2. The zipper height adjustment for newborns was another great idea. However, it's not perfect for small newborns. Even with the hip loop clips, it was still too big for our baby when she was born (2.6kg/ 5.7lbs). The first month, her head would bobble when we used it, so I had to hold her head.3. The 2 zippers that allow you to control the leg position. You can have the legs dangle, or zipped up to wrap the baby's legs around your hips. Fantastic idea! When facing towards me, I try to keep the zippers up so she gets support.4. Our daughter absolutely loves face forward position. She goes crazy happy when facing forward. However, I worry about extra pressure on her hip bones, so I limit this position to 1 hour at a time.5. The BB One has a nice hip strap. So it you tighten it up, you can reduce about 70% of the load off your shoulders. Although, my back still does get ache sometimes.6. Machine washableBUT, I have one big concern, and I hope Baby Bjorn will seriously look into this issue. After using the BB One for a while, the folding flap has become really soft. (You need to fold it down when the baby is facing out). But when the baby is facing towards you, the headrest flap is quite loose, and no longer supports the baby's head. When the baby falls asleep, her head dangles 90 degrees out with little support around the neck. This can't be good for the baby. (I'll see if I can post a picture later).Some other suggestions for future versions of this product:1. Add some loops on the front so I can clip on some toys?2. How about a pocket too? Every parent needs to carry stuff for their baby.3. The hip belt straps are too long, and they dangle, especially on my wife. I would like to have a belt clip.We have not used the back facing position yet, but plan to use it more when we do more hiking in the spring.

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier One, Black, Cotton","I was very impressed with the new Baby Bjorn.  This is a baby carrier that can be used from infancy all the way to three years old or 33 pounds, whichever comes first.  My baby is 5 months old and loves to be carried around.  This is the perfect way to get the vacuuming done and dinner started while still holding your baby.  There are three positions--baby facing inward in front, baby facing  outward in front (Which is great for a 5 month old!), and a back carrier for a toddler.I have a Baby Bjorn from 6 years ago that I used with my first child.  I have always liked the Baby Bjorn carrier. My firstborn liked it and my five month old liked it too...but this new model is improved!  It is stronger, well padded, has a adjustable straps for you and the baby,the clips are solid and easy to clip in and out, and it has a nice back support that seems to help with balance too.  Another new feature that I like are the zippers by the baby's legs.  If you have a young baby...you leave them zipped for a snug fit.  As your baby grows, you unzip the zippers as much as you need to adjust to your baby's leg size.Finally, I like how there are directions on a tag with this Baby Bjorn.  It's great for grandparents or daycare providers that might not use the Baby Bjorn all the time.  So whether you need a baby carrier for long hikes, a day trip at the zoo or just simply around the home, you will not be disappointed in the quality of the new Baby Bjorn!  I gave it five stars for quality and usefulness.  The only improvement I would like to see for the next Baby Bjorn is a small bag that clips on/off.  This would be helpful for carrying a diaper, a few wipes and a pacifier.",5,1

Summer Infant Connect Plus Internet Monitor System,"Had to research forever to find a unit that has both a hand monitor AND an internet connection.  I use it for elder care where there are non-family care-givers in the house when I'm not there.  To them it's just a baby monitor.  The night picture isn't crystal clear, but I just need to ensure she is getting the care she needs and see if she is in the bed.  If you need to see if the eyes are open, keep looking.  The perfect addition would be if the camera could send an email clip when motion is sensed (like DLink does).  I'm happy with the purchase.",4,1

Quilted Paisley Print Tote Bag/ Purse (Fuchsia),"I bought this purse because I was in desperate need of a bigger purse.

Philips Avent BPA Free Natural Essentials Gift Set,"This set is advertised as a gift set, and as such, it is probably almost perfect for any expecting parent that plans to bottle feed at some point.  Since most parents eventually do bottle feed, this set contains a little of everything needed for a newborn or a child getting close to switching to a sipping cup.  The gift set includes a sterilizer intended to be placed in your microwave, two small four ounce bottles with nipples, two larger nine ounce bottles with nipples, bottle covers, two silicone pacifiers, and a bottle brush.  The sterilizer makes a great place to keep the bottles after sterilizing, and the bottles are supposed to remain sterile for up to 24 hours if the lid of the sterilizer remains closed.The bottles are BPA-free plastic, which seems highly desirable given concerns about BPA.  The nipples are supposedly similar to mother's breast, though I am unsure of how closely they mimic a mother's nipple.  The bottle openings are large enough for the bottle cleaner to reach inside easily for more thorough cleaning.  The pacifiers are soft and are a big hit.I worried a bit about the longevity of plastic bottles and the associated nipples, but both seem quite durable.  I suggest replacing the nipples periodically because it seems to me that the nipples lose some flexibility with time and heat.  Perhaps it is perception, but new nipples seem softer and have a different appearance, to me, than nipples that have been clean multiple times.One other issue that can arise is baby's preference.  For reasons known only to babies, some babies have a dislike for certain nipples and a preference for other nipples.  Regardless of the reason, it is nearly impossible to get a baby to like a nipple once they have shown that they do not want it.  Once a baby refuses to accept a certain kind of nipple, replacements with a different kind are required and you may find your investment in a certain brand going to waste.  My only suggestion is to try the bottles and nipples before investing in a significant quantity of any one brand.These bottles represent the state-of-the-art in plastic bottle technology.  These plastic bottles are BPA-free and appear to be quite sturdy.  This gift set makes a great gift for any expecting or new mother, and can be an important part of making sure a new baby can be quickly and safely fed.Enjoy!",4,1
Fly Bike&reg; Foldable Indoor/Outdoor Toddlers Glide Tricycle - No Assembly Required - Pink,"I'm not really sure how tall other reviewers' children are, but my 2 year old girl fits just fine on this trike.  It's the perfect size for her.  She's always been right around the 50% for height and weight.  I was very hesitant because of the other reviews, but I'm glad that I took a chance.  She was excited when she saw it, though she hasn't ridden it much yet.  However, I just gave it to her 20 minutes ago.  A big chunk of plastic was missing from one of the back wheel locks, but it still functions ok and amazon refunded me a small amount.  I tried the trike to make sure it was still safe due to the wheel lock issue and it held my weight and maneuvered just fine.  I wouldn't put that much weight on it repeatedly, but it is sturdy enough to hold an adult (5'6 small/average size woman).  If I can find a way to propel myself around the kitchen, there has to be a way for bigger children to do it, too.",4,1

Summer Infant Little Looster,"The Little Looster will change the world.  Quite frankly, CHANGE the world for Moms & Dads & all those big-hearted caregivers who are tearing their hair out trying to get their perfecto-little toddler to squat dutifully and happily on the toilet and do their potty business.Usually, with their little legs dangling precariously, and their little hands gripping the potentially-nasty toilet seat in a life-or-death grip, it's harder than imagined to get the wee ones to wee.  Nope.  He/She is fearful (naturally) (instinctively) of falling into that pit of water & waste and being flushed to outer limits.So this Muther (name of Monica per info on the Looster website) located in the far-hinder lands of Oregon invents this crazy-delightful product - The Little Looster.Go ahead: show your Little Looster to some other adult and just watch them scratch their heads and say: DUH! and OF COURSE.  Etc.Now (finally?) lamby-pies from here to kingdom come can happily roost with support, confidence, grace and ease and get the bathroom duties accomplished without a fear (or whining-worthy-argument) about the dangers-on-the-throne.Legs supported nicely. Timidness turns to self-confidence.  (Can we say: bravery in the bathroom?)Bonus: Adults don't have to touch it to go about their own potty-biz.Life is good. It looks easy to clean.  I haven't dared to move it yet - the spell of the Little Looster is reigning supreme exactly where and how it is.  Why mess with perfection?Aahhhhh, Thank you Little Looster Mama.My Own Dear Angel Babe is resting comfortably as I write this, singing something creative about an itsy-bitsy spider meeting a choo-choo, and appearing not to have a care in the world.Opps - now said Angel is calling/singing/shouting to inform me that ""Potty is done!"", can I come in to wipe, and can Angel Toddler then do the FLUSH honors?Yup.

"Summer Infant Keep Me Clean Disposable Potty Protectors, 20 Count","I bought these recently for a multi-state trip that we were taking with 3 kids. I knew we'd end up using many road side rest areas and potentially some gas station bathrooms. I didn't want to have to worry about the kids touching too much or potentially a not-so-clean toilet when someone really has to go. These were perfect. Big enough that they covered everything that the kids might come in contact with, sturdy enough not to rip, and easy to fold up a bit smaller and squeeze in a hand or in a pocket to carry into the bathroom. My 9 and 6 year olds were able to use these by themselves with ease. I would buy these again.",5,1

I recently discovered that she will eat just about anything out of a pouch. I figured that purchasing these and filling them myself would be much cheaper than buying her a bunch of pouches. Right this second she's eating apple/pear sauce from one and there is no mess!!! I found it easier to use an cake decorating tool I've got to fill them. I just put the food in the tool, put the tip in the spout, and squeeze it right in!I did break one of the pouches when I couldn't get the zipper open. I contacted the company only to find out if there was something I was doing wrong. They replaced the product right away. Customer service was beyond anything I ever expected. Amazing product, amazing company!!",5,1

The only downfall I have is with the spout being on the side, it makes it a little difficult to organize in my tray containers in the freezer. Other than that these are the absolute best pouches I have used!!!  The double zipper seal is great and does not leak.  The zipper being on the top with the expandable bottom gussett make the pouch very easy to fill. The flaps on the seal make for easy opening of the pouch. Pouch is easy to clean and when held to a light it is pretty easy to see if anything is left behind.  The designs on the front are cute and my daughter loves them.  The spout on the side is easy to use and clean and my daughter has no problem handling the pouch.  Like I said I have tried several pouches and by far this has been the best one yet.",5,1

Boken Every Day Diaper Bag in Black,"We got this as our 2nd bag to use for traveling and going to the beach & park with, as our &#34;nice&#34; diaper bag we had kept getting dirty and sandy and was a complete pain to keep cleaning.  We were happy to find this bag as advertised - unisex, extremely lightweight and easy to clean with a baby wipe!  I especially love the convertible straps.  I use the tote straps mostly, but love having the backpack option when things get hectic!  The backpack straps aren't the most padded, but haven't been uncomfortable even when wearing it that way for a couple hours, and that's a trade I'm willing to make with it being convertible and light! My husband likes the long messenger strap.  He hated carrying our other bag like a tote (not to mention it looked like a purse!).There are 3 handy zip pockets for small/personal items and I love the big mesh pocket on the side for my big water bottle or coffee thermos and the flap pocket on the other side is perfect for my son's sippy cup.",5,1

Infant Optics DXR-8 Pan/Tilt/Zoom 3.5&quot; Video Baby Monitor With Interchangeable Optical Lens,"i ordered this monitor after purchasing and returning 2 other brands..samsung and Foscam. The foscam stopped working after 6 months and the samsung had no reception after about 200 feet from the room. I read all the reviews on this infant optics,,the good and the bad, prior to purchasing.this is what I've found1. The &#34;LOUD&#34; beeping ,I've read so many complaints about, in fact is not loud or annoying. Its a normal beeping sound if you go out of range or have a low battery. What parent wouldn't want to know if the monitor that is watching their baby is not working properly. Seriously, I find this complaint a little ridiculous.2. The range complaints about this monitor just have not proved to be a problem at our home. I can take the monitor out by the pool, or nest door and i have never had a problem with being out of range. In fact, I find it to have better range that the previous 2 monitors that I have used.3. The complaint that even on the highest volume setting, you cannot hear your child&#8230;I have found that on the highest volume setting, my little sweet 1 year old,sounds toooo loud. I have set it on medium and I can hear everything.I found registering the warranty to be quick and easy. i received an email within seconds confirming the warranty registration.I love the optics on this monitor..the picture quality is crisp and clear, even the night vision works perfectly.The remote camera swivel and zoom works very, very smoothly.I love this monitor, and only wish I had purchased it first a year ago.",5,1

I have had the Chicco Cortina, the Britax B Agile, a Maclaren Triumph, and a Bugaboo Bee - among all these strollers, this is the one that had everything I needed/wanted.- It has all the features of bigger strollers, but in a super lightweight package.- It has a HUGE canopy, that my daughter loves - it blocks the sun completely, even when she's asleep.- It has a big basket for an umbrella stroller - big enough to hold my diaper bag, etc.- Additionally, it lays FLAT - perfect for when my little one has fallen asleep.- It is sturdy and well-made, but light enough that I can lift it easily with the included shoulder strap.- We live in the city, and this stroller has held up over time. It also handles city-terrain very well (sidewalks, stores, pavement).... I could go on and on about how much I love this stroller. If it ever breaks, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again!",5,1

It&#8217;s actually the perfect size for a stocking stuffer for the toddler set.  My one-year-old is fascinated by toys with simple repetitive motions like this bird that spins through the rhinoceros.  He will play with them over and over again, and it&#8217;s like we can practically see the little gears in his brain turning while he does.  This little toy with its colorful spotted rhino and spinning birdie is perfect for him.  I also like that this toy is wooden rather than plastic; wooden toys seem to have their own special appeal.",4,1
Alva Baby AI2 Color Snap Reuseable Washable Pocket Cloth Diaper Nappy With 2 Inserts CA10,"I've been switching my 20 month old over from prefolds+snappi+covers to pocket diapers because he's just gotten too wriggly and big to fight with during changing times and I need something I can fasted while he's standing up during potty training. I have another baby on the way as well, and am looking to cut down the effort involved in taking care of two young children in diapers. I loved the Oso cozy indian pre-folds paired with Thirsties Duo wrap covers both when my son was a newborn (8lbs) and as he got bigger (20 lbs), but once he started to walk and wriggle, diaper changes became something to dread.In my quest for an acceptable pocket diaper, I've used Bum Genius (completely worthless), Fuzzibunz (OK under the right conditions, but untrustworthy), Thirsties duo (great) and Rumparooz (also great). The only pocket diaper with a double gusset I HAVEN'T tried is the new Thirsties one-size pocket diaper, because I fell in love with this one before I saw it and I have no urge to pay twice as much to try a diaper that can't possibly be as good as this one (I can tell from the side buttons).The Bum Genius and Fuzzibunz just aren't worth buying - without a double leg gusset, pee and liquidy solids go right out the leg, especially since the microfiber fleece lining every pocket diaper doesn't absorb as readily as a cotton prefold. The fuzzibunz have adjustable leg gussets that are a huge pain in the butt (mine, not his) to adjust and it requires a lot of creative buttoning angles to cinch the legs right, which I have no patience for. These two are so worthless I'd rather use an emergency T-shirt as a diaper than them, and have gotten rid of them.The Thirsties Duo and Rumparooz pocket diapers are both amazing - double gussets on both, two stuffers each, great patterns, etc. The only issue is that they are crazy expensive - over twice the price of these Alva diapers, and each one is not technically PERFECT. The Rumparooz have only one opening for stuffers, which makes loading them just slightly harder, and they lack the outer side-snap buttons that I like to use as an anchor to get the diaper on before I cinch it tight and make adjustments with the inner buttons. At 26 lbs and 34&#34; (in other words, very skinny), my son is practically on the last buttons of the Rumparooz, and the leg openings have very little stretch, leaving him with red marks on his legs that take all day to disappear. The Thirsties duo has two openings for the stuffer and nice stretchy legs and leg gussets, but no way to anchor the stuffer to the cover and no flaps to keep them in.  The Thirsties DO have an elasticized waist which eliminates gaping and no other diaper I've found has that, but so far as I can tell, functionally it makes little difference. They are also hard to find and as I said, over twice as expensive as these Alvas.This diaper, however, I am in LOVE with. Stuffers that anchor onto the cover. Double-openings for the stuffers. Flaps to cover the stuffer ends so they don't wick outside the cover (I assume these won't agitate out in the wash, FYI, but I don't care since I remove them first on all my diapers anyway). I haven't tried this on the tiniest baby yet, but the fold-over snaps on the sides give me hope for a really adjustable range, and my son is in the middle of the snap sizes so I know he has plenty of room to grow. There is the side anchor button I love on the Thirsties that Rumparooz lacks. There are the two vertical buttons to allow for extra leg adjustment that Thirsties lack. The buttons on the solid-color diapers are color coded for easy reference! (But not on the cow print, oh well.)The only 'downsides' I can see to this diaper are:The fabric feels slightly cheaper and less smooth than the outer fabric of other diapers. I couldn't care less about how luxurious my diapers feel, if it's just as waterproof, which it appears to be. It's still soft enough to cuddle my son, doesn't snag on anything, and isn't at all scratchy.The Alva diapers are also made in China instead of America (Thirsties are made in Colorado), which explains the fact that the prices are less than half the cost. So ethically I SHOULD buy the American-Made Thirsties, but this diaper just has EVERYTHING that I want in a diaper at less than half the cost, and with another baby on the way, I don't have the patience to wrestle with an inferior product. So, I am likely funding some orphan's slave-labor in a sweatshop somewhere. I am uncomfortable with this, but these diapers are so amazing!I seriously cannot believe these diapers aren't more popular, they are FANTASTIC.",5,1
GroVia Wet Bag 3-Pack (WildFlower),"Those are A LOT bigger than I expected them to be and I haven't found any deal close to this price.

"Waterproof Baby Bibs with Snaps for Girls &amp; Boys, Gift Box 10 Pack, Solid Colors","These are the perfect bib for infants (or gift for friend with new baby). They fasten with snaps, not Velcro, so my son's skin doesn't get irritated. They are terry cloth so they absorb lots of spit up and drool and are comfortable to keep on all day both for me and my baby. They are also waterproof between the terry cloth front and back so when your baby spits up, it does not soak thru the bib to his onesie. The size is just right. They are not so large for my 4 month old that you couldn't see what he is wearing, but it gives enough coverage of his whole torso that I am not changing his outfit every time he spits up.  And the solid primary color package is classic. I ordered these for my son when I was searching for non-Velcro bibs, but the efficiency of these bibs, as well as the bright striped packaging they came in, has made me think these will be my new baby gifts. One of those &#34;this is what parents really need&#34; gifts.",5,1

Dream On Me Twilight 5 inches 80 Coil Spring Crib and Toddler Bed Mattress,"Fantastic. Our crib recommended a mattress no thinner than 4"" and no thicker than 6"". This fit right in there and the price we unbeatable. We paid 35$, the mattress arrived on time and fits perfectly in the crib. I love that it (as I think most crib mattresses are) is water proof.This mattress is for out third child (the other 2 are both in a larger bed and have been for over a year). I disagree with the review that states this mattress is too soft for a new born. I would compare it to the 100$ mattress we purchased 5 years ago for one of our sons in a heart beat.I am not sure about other reviewers having issues with the sewing quality. The mattress I received looked fantastic.It does not seem to be overly noisy to me. I think proper bedding would prevent that from being an issue.I am sure we will get years of use out of it. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",5,1
Fisher-Price Deluxe Sit-Me-Up Floor Seat,My son is only 3 months old and absolutely LOVES this thing. I contemplated a full-on jumperoo as he HATES normal swings that can actually fit him right now.

"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Pink","My grand daughter is almost 3 months old and seemed bored and restless, her little feet kicking constantly, this  activity gym is perfect, it occupies her and she will lay and kick and try to reach for the toys a good while. I highly recommend this!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Pink","This gym is very nice and well thought out. There isn't as much room to move around as with a Gymini, but this gym is more versatile and entertains babies with sights and sounds from infancy until they're toddlers.There are four hanging toys and mirror overhead, which are nice but of course the piano is the best part. It has a piano mode and a music mode and 2 volume settings. There are four huge white keys which are the perfect size for little feet and hands (the black keys don't play). The gym can even be converted into a tummy time gym, with the toys being attached to the pad while the piano can still be kicked. Later on when the baby can sit up, they can play the piano sitting up as well.Needless to say, this gym is best used on carpet instead of atop hard floor since the pad is thin. When the baby outgrows the gym you can detach the piano, which is lightweight and has a handle for easy carrying. A handy and worthwhile investment, 5 stars.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Pink","With a 4 1/2 months old, you are limited on how much you can review since they can't generally sit up, etc. The one configuration that is perfect for her is laying her on her back where she can kick the piano with her feet and bat the toys over her. She does all of that, and quite a bit of it. She seems to enjoy it for a little while.  Probably not quite as long as other activities, but it's impressive that she likes the toy enough that she will stay on her back for a while to play with it. The keyboard is currently on &#8220;short sound&#8221; mode (there is also long play for 15 minutes), so it plays a note with each kick and then after a pause plays a short jingle. She likes that she makes the sounds happen, and also likes the dangling toys.  She hasn&#8217;t paid too much attention to the mirror yet. The toys are detachable, as is the piano. Bonus: Set up and changes are a snap.The fact that this will grow with her as she learns to crawl, sit up, walk, etc. makes it an ideal toy. And what baby doesn't like musical sounds?

Fisher-Price 4-in-1 Sling N Seat Tub,"So pleased with this tub. It obviously takes up much more space than the flat sponge we were using for our little guy, but he loves this so much better because he doesn't have to lie completely flat. We got this when he was almost 4 months, so we never used the sling and just went straight to the reclined bathing position. It's perfect. When this is dry (outside of the tub), I also let him sit in the supported sitting position just for fun, and he is so proud of himself to be able to sit up on his own! Soon I'll use that position to actually bathe him, but for now, he's a little too wobbly and he likes the reclined position better...plus it feels safer, when he's all slippery soapy!Would absolutely buy again!",5,1
Fisher-Price The Perfect Potty Ring,"I went through 4 different potty rings until I found this one (which for some reason doesn't really come up on the searches... maybe it's fairly new?) - the other ones were flimsy, unstable and generally useless.This is is PERFECT! Finally, a ring that fits on all 3 toilets without waddling, and I love the holder hook!",5,1
Sassy Sit &amp; Play Sensory Seat,"my baby loved this from about 3.5 months on---now she is almost 5 months and loves to sit in it! its her favorite place to sit and play. the colours and toys keep her entertained. i can actually sit her in this and get a few minutes peace (you have to watch them, though, or sit it on the floor on a pad/or blanket because it will help them sit, but if they're not good sitters, they will fall over). It is perfect for my baby, as she is on the petite side, but, if you have a chunky or larger sized baby, they might not fit (although it would still be worth it for a tummy time toy, i think). Well worth the money for us and we have gotten a lot of use out of it.",5,1
"Summer Infant Fuze Travel System with Prodigy Infant Car Seat, Blaze","Overall, I think the Fuze Travel System is a great system and would recommend it to anyone. Below are my pros and cons.Pros:Extremely easy to put together and I am not handy at all. I had it done in less than 10 minutes and didn't really need to follow the directions at all.Car seat was extremely easy to install following the icons. I know my son is safe and secure. I also love that the straps adjust as my son grows!The handle bar adjusts which is perfect for my family as I am 5'1"" and my husband is 6'1"".The reclining seat is perfect for when my son is napping. The seat is also large enough for older children. Both my 3 year old and 6 month old love the seat.The basket underneath is roomy enough for my diaper bag and all my purchases when I am out shopping!I love the fact that you can move the seat to make the child forward facing or rear facing if they are younger and you want to keep an eye on them.For being a larger stroller, it is extremely light weight and easy to navigate over all terrain. I have used it on grass, pavement and bumpy dirt roads without a problem. It also folds up very nicely and doesn't take up too much room in my trunk.Cons:I wish there was more than 1 cup holder or another space up top for me to use. When taking longer walks, I like to have my cell phone/keys near me. With this stroller, other than the cup holder, your keys, phone and other items need to go in the mesh bag area on the back of the seat. When you are using the infant seat adaptor, there is no mesh area and all you have to use is the one cup holder or bottom basket.Often times you have to remove the cup holder when folding the stroller or the cup holder almost gets pushed off when a folds. Not a huge deal but you have to remember to put it back on the next time you want to use it.Disclosure: I was given a free sample of this product to review, however my opinions are my own",4,1
Summer Infant 2-in-1 Snuzzler Car Piddlepad,"i had a hard time finding a stroller liner for my city mini because of the pull to fold strap being located in the seat - this liner is perfect for all my needs.  it fits the stroller just awesome, my 5mo old can sit in the stroller seat now and be super comfy and supported.  she fell asleep within minutes actually.  i also then dont have to worry about a diaper leak ruining my stroller because of the piddle pad seat part.  also, i can easily fold my city mini with this in the seat.  it stays put well because the straps of the stroller hold it in, and it nestles in nicely.  i also love that its modular so you can use or not use whichever parts of it you want.  when she's a bit older, i dont need the headrest, or just want the piddle pad, they all come apart.  and its very soft.  love it!!!  much better than the other snuzzler version that has legs on it.",5,1

"Thirsties Duo Wrap Diaper Cover with Hook and Loop, Aqua, Size 1","So my daughter is way into dolls right now, and for some reason the manufactures put cheap disposable diapers on them.These are amazingly perfect for her dolls and fits without a hitch. They are super easy to wash and seem to be very durable.If my children were still in diapers these would have been a must have for me. Recommended!",4,1
"Safety 1st  Incognito Kid Positioning Seat, Gray","This was the perfect solution.  Our child is almost 8 and 102 pounds.  To big for the backless booster seat but the way the backseat in the car is configured, the seat belt hit them across the face.  This seat was perfect as it gave them just enough boost for the seat belt to lay where it should and our child is so excited (as are we) that they can now buckle the seatbelt by themselves!",5,1

"Dream On Me Zodiak Portable Playard, Navy",We've been doing a lot of traveling and wanted something lightweight that we could fit into a suitcase. This works perfect. The pad is really thin but we always add a folded blanket in the bottom and he seems to be perfectly comfy in there for naps and night time sleeps. It's pops up and colapes easily.,5,1

Blankets and Beyond Retro Mom Swaddle Blanket Pink,"I got this as a gift.  My baby loves it!  The blanket is super soft and warm. It's perfect for babies born during the winter months.  It's not tight like other swaddlers, but is snug enough that it keeps baby comfortable.  My baby sleeps very soundly at night in this and the blanket allows her to move her arms a little bit, but still remain swaddled.  The blanket is held by velco strips that you have to match up, which is the only drawback.",5,1

"Britax Marathon G4 Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","Of course, I haven't been in a car accident (thank God) to test the safety of the car seat, but I really like it. Appearance-wise, it is very sturdy. Also, it was a BREEZE to install. I was actually going to pay $50 to have this professionally installed in my car, but thought I would try it myself first. I have Dodge Charger; a sort of bigger car, and this fits perfectly, rear facing, in the middle backseat. I made sure I adjusted everything to my baby (straps, recline, etc) before I put it in the car. This also made things easier. Then, all I did was strap the LATCH connectors in and made sure they were nice and tight. After installing, the car seat moves extremely minimally, which made me feel even better. I'm so glad I did it myself instead of paying someone! I'm also happy that this car seat will last my now 7-month old for awhile. Very good purchase and also a very good price on Amazon.",5,1
"Britax Boulevard G4 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx",I wouldn't use any other brand of car seat. Downsized to the Britax Boulevard for my mom's car because the extra side air pillows made the seat to wide for the backseat of her CRV (we have to get three kids in the back). This seat fits perfectly without sacrificing the high standards for safety that Britax provides.,5,1
ErgoBaby Wrap (Pepper),"I love, Love, LOVE wraps!  I've had a Moby before, but never anything else.  This wrap is FABULOUS and definitely ranks as a favorite.The first thing most people ask about wrapping - how do you do it?  YOUTUBE!  There are so many helpful videos to teach you all kinds of wraps to make wearing your baby as comfortable as possible.  I have a short torso, and my back isn't in the best shape.  For me, the best carries are the simplest - criss-cross over my back to distribute the weight.  Ask other moms who baby-wear what carries work best for them and have them demonstrate.  Some areas even have baby-wearing groups you can join to learn and experiment together!The second thing I get asked most - isn't it time-consuming?  When I first started wearing my babies, yes, it was.  I would get to the commissary and pull the wrap out of the trunk and stand there in the parking lot trying to wrap myself up before the baby cried. I figured out that if I did it home, while baby was still playing or whatever else before we left, it wasn't bad at all.  Also, the more I used it, the less time it took me to get tied just the way I liked.  Practice makes perfect and before long, it didn't take but a few seconds more to wrap the baby than to use a soft-structured buckle carrier.Third - isn't it hot?  Some materials breathe better than others, for sure.  This material was pretty good on that scale.  You ARE wearing another tiny human close to you, so it's going to be warm.  The Ergo wrap wasn't any hotter than the Moby and I just used it cruising around the park with the heat index of 105.  Wear a tank top or lightweight shirt, and dress baby appropriately, and you'll be fine.Overall, I love this wrap.  It offers versatility in that you can wrap and tie it a multitude of ways, and the size is always just right for you and baby.  It's easy to clean - it's machine washable even in my apartment-sized machine.  The contrasting fabric swatch makes it easy to find the middle when you're wrapping, and the bonus is that it's a pocket!  Just remember not to put anything in there that might poke baby!  The spandex gives it a little more durability, I think, too.  The Moby definitely stretched out over a few short months with a newborn, and I can see this wrap keeping it's tension a lot longer because of the composition and quality of the material.  It's rated for up to 31 pounds, so you can get quite a bit of time out of it, too!  This is a great addition to our collection of every day use items for baby and youngsters!",5,1
Fresh Baby So Easy First Toothbrush,"As a dental professional, I am always looking for products that make it easy to introduce brushing at an early age.  This brush is a perfect choice. The protective stopper allows for independence without the fear of pushing the brush too far into the mouth.  The handle is big enough for easy grip and soft enough to feel good in a child's hands, and the silicone bristles are sturdy enough for brushing and chewing.  I definitely recommend trying this product!",5,1
Baybee Ethiks Fair Trade Nursing Cover (Catalina),This is by far my favorite nursing cover.  The picture does not do this one justice.  It is a beautiful delicate fabric and there is a lace trim that makes it super super cute. Very charming and I'm not sure there is one on the market like it.  It's perfect for the hot summer days with the breathable fabric so the baby does not get so sweaty.  Thanks for making this one!,5,1
"Babyletto Harlow 3-in-1 Covertible Crib, White with Grey Acrylic","My husband was impressed with how easy it was to put the crib together. It is sturdy and feels safe for our expected arrival. The design is perfect! I wanted a clean, modern look for the nusery. Other acrylic cribs were very expensive, so this Babyletto was a bit of a compromise. It did not disappoint!!  The nursery isn't close to being finished, but this crib already makes it Pinterest worthy. Design, quality, and good value. I strongly recommend this crib.",5,1

Infantino Tote It Bottle Holder,I received the Neoprene Necessities product line form Infantino to facilitate my review.I really liked this product. I used the bottle holder for a long trip in the car. It worked great. The bottles stayed warm in the insulated interior.I use tall skinny bottles which fit perfectly in the bag. I am not so sure how wider bottles would work. It is made of very stretchy material though so it might work.I liked that I could easily find my &#34;bottle bag&#34; in the large diaper bag on the trip.,4,1
Posh Play - Grapefruit Play Mat,"Love this play mat! Received as a gift and wasn't sure how much use I would get out of it since my kids were 2 and 4, so happy I have it. Great for all the arts and crafts project to keep floor clean, great to take to soccer games, and the perfect mat to set under their table at snack time for easy clean up.",5,1

"Orbit Baby G3 Stroller Cargo Basket, Black","I have a G2, saw the previous review and felt confident purchasing the basket. It fits the stroller perfectly and the stroller still folds normally. Basket slides in and out easily just like the pod, which I now keep inside the basket since there's so much room now.After taking my older kids to Disney world. I love this basket even more!! I used the zippered side pockets for diapers, wipes, ointment, food, formula, and spoons. Yes!! All in the side zip pockets. I was able to close the stroller with these items still in place. This left plenty of room for other items in the basket. No baby bag needed!",5,1
"Lolly &amp; Me McKinley 4 in 1 Convertible Crib, Chocolate","So far, so good! It was easy to put together. I have two gripes. One is that the instructions say there should be 8 dowels required for the last step, but you only need 4. I wasted 30 minutes finding and cutting the right pencil down to size, only to come back and find out I didn't need them... Oh well.The second is that the curved part isn't seamless.. Where the parts meet up there is a ridge where, in my opinion, there shouldn't be. Maybe that's the design, but I can overlook it.It looks great, and I'm sure once we get the mattress, it will be perfect!",4,1
"Delta Children's Products Playard, Novel Ideas, 36&quot; x 36&quot;","We have a one story home so I never felt that I needed a Pack N Play, but as my son became mobile, it was apparent that I needed something to place him in when I needed to get chores done. Most of my friends and family members have purchased the regular Pack N Plays with all the fancy equipment. They used it when their little ones were young, but there wasn't enough space when they got older. So I took the search on Amazon and came upon this Play Pen.This is what you call a play pen. The size is perfect and there is actually enough space to play in. It's simple, easy to set up, and I love the colors and design. The size reminds me of the olden day play pens; think Michelle's play pen from Full House. It's well built, well priced, and overall a great investment. Skip the pack n plays and buy this instead. This will be more useful as your child gets older.",5,1

Replaces Medela Valve, and Membrane. Can Be Sanitized with Medela Quick Clean Micro Steam Bag","I am an exclusive pumper and I attempt to switch out the valves every 6-8 weeks and the membranes every 3-4 weeks to help with suction and production.  I have found that it is not always enough to just switch membranes as the valves will get loose from cleaning, effecting suction.  This is a perfect set of valves and membranes for my replacement schedule.",5,1
"Munchkin, Fresh Food Freezer Trays - 2 ea, 2 Pack","This is another innovative and useful, but affordable product from Munchkin, they have made a good durable product that can be used again and again.I have made quite a few batches of food in these for my little girl, I was going to go with a traditional ice cube tray but I really wanted the lids on them to protect them from contamination as things tend to get thrown around in our freezer, these were my answer!These were fairly easy to open and close. easy to open even after freezing, the food cubes aren't that easy to get out afterwards, I needed to run hot water on the bottom to loosen them and then stuck a sharp knife in the side to work them out, I did this carefully so as not to hurt myself. Other than that I am impressed if you fill these with one batch of food you have alot of food frozen for your little one in easy to thaw, perfect portioned food.",4,1
Unotux 2pc Boys Satin Royal Blue Vest and Bow tie Set from Baby to Teen (7),"I had ordered 3 vests for a wedding. They arrived quickly, but were the wrong sizes due to a technical error.

They run a bit small, so keep that in mind when ordering. Adorable vests. Perfect!",5,1

AngelCare AC-201 New Model Baby Movement Sensor and Sound Monitor with Night Light,"We have used this monitor every time our son sleeps (nap or night time) since the day we brought him home. He is nearly 17 months old now. The only false alarms we have gotten were a few times when he squirmed his way into a corner of the crib and was sleeping on his side, which just caused the monitor not to be able to detect him. He loves to sleep in an L position in the corner and I don't fault the monitor for that. It scared us the first couple of times, but wasn't anything that caused  more than a hurried trip back to his crib and we realized what was wrong. All in all, that situation probably happened 12-14 times, but it was always because of his positioning and as he grew, it stopped happening.My only complaint is that there are times when it works perfectly and then other times, for no apparent reason, it will just start going nuts with static and interference. There are enough issues with interference that I am shopping for a different brand and reading lots of reviews before purchasing a 2nd monitor for the baby that is arriving in a couple weeks.Overall, we haven't been unhappy and I don't think it is a bad product - our only issue is the interference, but that may be worse in our area because we live in a townhome in the city, so it could be related to that. Perhaps a little more spacing between neighbors and various electronics and other monitors, etc. would fix this.One last note - their customer service is top-notch. We had a short of some type in the portable unit that stays with the parents. It took one email and I got an immediate response (within about 10-12 hours) and they were sending me a replacement. They didn't even ask me to return the defective one and they were very apologetic. That kind of customer service is hard to find these days!",4,1

The corner edge pieces fit perfectly on the edges of my dining room table. It now provides a &#34;cushion&#34; at the table ends and definitely helps prevent an accidental collision. Highly recommended for protection against sharp table ends.,5,1
"Juno Blu Nepenthe Breast Pump Tote Bag, Black","This bag is expensive, but I think it's worth it.Going back to work after a baby is hard enough. This makes my life easier.  That is money well spent in my book. Also, with Obamacare, my insurance covered the cost of my Medela pump so I could justify this purchase their too.This bag holds so much and allows me to have ONE bag to deal with. I use it as a purse/pump bag. Love the key holder, all of the pockets, the blue bag to hold all of my extra pump crap (pump bra, pump wipes, clean bottles, etc). This bag is made well and it goes with everything fashion-wise.Before I bought this I read as many reviews as I could find and heard some ladies say they didn't like that there pump wasn't &#34;protected&#34; as much as they would want in the pump pouch. I went to Walmart and bought a $2 collapsible lunch bag, shoved my pump in that and put that whole &#34;protected&#34; pump into the pump pouch in this bag. Perfect!The other great thing is the pump pouch is collapsible so I can use this bag long after my pumping days are through.I have a 15&#34; Mac that I use for work and it doesn't fit too well in this bag with all the stuff I have to carry. It will stand up vertically pretty well, but the safer horizontal carrying option doesn't really fit with this bag. Now, after I'm done pumping and don't have the pump in there...this will be a great laptop/work bag.",5,1

"JOOVY Noodle Helmet, Black","Look no further! This is the best infant/toddler helmet out there. Solidly built, well-made, quality materials AND adjustable with a dial in the back to custom fit it to your child's head. It FULLY covers the child's skull and upper neck/occipital area, the straps are firmly secured deep into the inner helmet, it has abundant, cushioned padding inside with well-designed cooling vents and a soft pad on the chin strap, so it won't irritate your little one. This is it, this is the one. This helmet is as rock solid and well made as any of the adult helmets that my husband and I have. No other brand I have tried can compare.Like you may have, I went to other, more reputable helmet names first. The Giro infant/toddler helmet: not adjustable, and unbelievably--the chin straps are attached to the inner helmet foam by removable velcro pieces, and can just pull off--imagine that in an accident? (Not only that, mine arrived with the velcro pieces, which are attached with glue to the styrofoam, actually already melted off in shipping--crazy. The Giro is dangerous and should be recalled.) The Bell infant/toddler helmet is also not adjustable, and although the straps are solidly attached into the helmet, there is only bare, smelly white styrofoam against the child's head, with a few soft foam pieces glued in for ""comfort"" or ""sizing"" which doesn't really keep the helmet sturdy and snug on the child's head. (Again, because it is not adjustable.) Plus, these tiny, poorly glued soft foam pieces were easily and delightfully ripped out by my 21 month old, leaving the inner helmet bare and not padded. It also easily cracked on the first minor tumble. Neither of these helmets have the full coverage, adjustability, inner cushioned padding or soft material on the chin strap. Giro and Bell = cheap, poorly designed, not adjustable = not very safe.The JOOVY Noodle is SOLID. The kind of helmet that you would want on your own head, thus the kind you would want on your child's. It is worth the extra money, and upon opening it and putting it on your child's sweet little head--easily adjusting it to the perfect fit with the turn of a dial--you will feel the same peace of mind that I did. Ahhh. Finally. The Perfect Helmet. Thank you, JOOVY. You have made an excellent, unparalleled product.(By the way, my 21 month old daughter is in the 50th percentile with an average sized head.)",5,1

Sturdy Design For Less Mess - Food Portions Pop Out Easily! **Satisfaction Guarantee!","So we're a very aware family when it comes to food.  I get leary about the food I'm eating, much less my kids & grandbabies.  So when my daughter just had her 3rd baby, we're back to baby food.  We love to keep his food as healthy as possible.  His momma is fantastic at keeping everything natural.  So I have to keep the standards up when he visits Nanny's house.  So this little product makes it perfect for him to visit ... I get some natural foods mashed up & freeze them in this container & its ready when he comes to visit.The cups are each large enough for a good serving for a baby.  And you can even put different foods in each one as they grow up to give more servings of different foods.I liked the options it gave to use for other uses.  I will use this as an ice tray when the babies grow up... or even make my own healthy banana puddings or yummy treats to go in there.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the lid wasn't as secure as I'd want it.  It just didn't seal up very tight.  It stays on, but not like a suction sort of seal that I like for the freezer.  Other then that, its definitely a product to use - for lots of things!",4,1

Bebe Au Lait Muslin Nursing Cover - Isla,"I had a plain, cheap cover from Target, which helped me appreciate how really, really great this is.  The plastic curved neckline is a must with a newborn, when it still takes both hands to get baby latched.  The gauze material is beautiful, soft, and SO breathable, so baby won't sweat if you are on the beach or at the pool like under the solid fabric.  Still, there is just enough weight to drape beautifully, keeping mom covered instead of flapping around.  Yes, you can see through the weave.  That is what gauze fabric means.  However, the effect as a whole obscures perfectly well and preserve's mom's privacy.  Even if I didn't live in the subtropics, I still would have chosen this cover as the prettiest pattern of any of the brands.",5,1

This stroller would be absolutely perfect if two features are addressed.  1. The canopy when folded back hides the handlebar which bothered me to no end.  2. The recline is great and would love to see a one handed recline but most of all I would love a more upright seat setting.Perfect replacement for umbrella travel strollers.The push and handling is amazing with zippy turns and smooth steering.  The basket is a decent size and I was able to fit my medium sized diaper bag as well as snack bag with no problem.The handlebar is pretty short and doesn't give much room to use a parent console except the skip hop one.  Also, the skip hop stroller liner fit perfectly.",4,1
Maxboost Fusion Snap-on iPhone 5S/5 Case - Red (Fit Fusion Battery Case for iPhone 5S/5),"I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation. The snap-on iphone case is awesome, perfectly fit, cool design, easy grip and high quality product. I highly recommend it to iphone users.",5,1
Maxboost Fusion Snap-on iPhone 5S/5 Case - Navy Blue (Fit Fusion Battery Case for iPhone 5S/5),"So I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation and I'm very pleased with it. It is very minimalistic so it doesn't make your slim Iphone 5 or 5s look bulky and it feels real nice in your hands. The material its made of seems to be a rubber or silicone material which provides for a nice grip when you hold your phone. Your phone wont slip out of your hands as it would with a plastic case. And all the openings on the sides are aligned perfectly with the buttons on the Iphone for easy access. All in all, I think this case is a good investment for those who just will like a minimalistic case for their Iphone. Even though I got my case for free, if I would have been looking for a case I would highly consider this one.",5,1

It's easy to snap on too, and offers excellent protection!",5,1
Unotux Teal Infant Boys Toddler Eton 5pc Formal Vest Shorts Set Suits Hat S-4T (S:(0-6 months)),"This suit is indeed really nice. I bought it to bless my 2mth old son who is 14pounds, the fit is perfect. However i recommend the use of a shirt in the form of a onesie to prevent the shirt from lifting when the child is been carried. Nonetheless, great product, great material.",5,1
Chummie Potty Training Ladder Step Up Seat,My son likes it. It is easy to put it together and it holds the toilet cover perfectly.,4,1
Safety 1st Clean and Comfy Feeding Booster,"We recently bought the safety 1st booster seat and so far have loved everything about it. We wanted a sturdy, easy to clean booster seat for our dining room table and that is exactly what this is. It was easy and quick to assemble, our 6 month old baby sits perfect in the chair and is very happy sitting there eating his first meals. I would recommend this seat to anyone.",5,1
Tidy Tots Cloth Diaper Essential Set (One Size 10-40 lbs)-Spring Green and Dinosaur,"I haven't decided if I love this diaper system or only like it. I do think id be perfectly happy if my stash was exclusively Tidy Tots and they will let you return used diapers if you decide you don't like the system so it's totally worth a try, I decided to keep mine. Haven't decided if I'm getting more or not. I've tried all the major players, BG, FzBn, Rmparroz, Thirsties, etc. some of those I like some not. I prefer the natural fibers like hemp over microfiber in most diapers (if your having laundry issues ditch the microfiber !)At first glance it feels expensive but it is a one size diaper and hemp!The cover alone: It really does fit even without rise adjustments! And I love not having to do those rise snaps. My son is currently 14 lbs at 2 months and breast fed and these have never leaked even for poo-splosions. I can't say that for any other diaper. It's a nice cover over a snappied fitted or prefold or flat too. There is lots of room in it so you certainly wouldn't call it trim but it smooshes down easily too. The leg gussets are great and don't leave red marks at all. It feels somewhat huge on my boy but it works really well even though he's fairly skinny but in the weight range (wears a size small thirsties or FzBn still on the smallest settings). I think the newborn size would be a better fit for him right now but the one size still functions perfectly.The inserts: you probably don't want to use them in any other cover, you could but probably won't, perhaps the boosters. They do dry quite fast in the dryer, no extra cycles needed. Having the ability to easily double up the booster is great!As a system: it's good. It's easy. The flushable liners are easy to put on and really don't move around at all, however those are not needed for breast fed babies, I'm sure itll be nice later.  Right now I like these. They are one of the first diapers my husband grabs if he's on duty. I think in a few months we will find they are even better as he gets bigger.",4,1
"2 Pack Food Catcher Pocket Baby Bib &amp; BONUS eBook. Soft &amp; Flexible Closure to Fit Growing Babies &amp; Toddlers. Stunning Unisex Colors with Ergonomic and Stylish Design are Odorless, Waterproof, Wipe Clean, and Stain-Resistant. Perfect Baby Shower Gift!","I bought this for a friend's baby (he is 6 months old at the time I wrote this) who lives in a different state, and she told me that she loves, loves, loves this bib, and so does her infant son. They are easy to clean up, and the pocket/crumb catcher is a great feature. Best of all she doesn't have to be constantly washing several bibs. Since this is made of silicone, it doubles as a teether, since her baby's teeth are just coming in and he just loves biting on it.These are big enough to use up to the toddler stage.",5,1
"Miracle Blanket Sleeper Wearable Blanket, Gray, Medium",Love this blanket!  I tried another but this one was much better quality.  It fits perfect and is also very soft.  My little girl loves to sleep in it!  I recommend getting two so when one is dirty you aren't having to go without.,5,1

Kawaii Baby Bamboo Charcoal One Size Cloth Diaper with 2 Four Layers Inserts &quot; Owls &quot;,"These are a little tricky to get the perfect fit at first, but the best thing about them are the inserts and the soft outer cover.  No leaks yet with these.  I prefer the Kawaii to Fuzzibunz Elite. These have more snaap options to get the legs just right.",4,1
"JJ Cole Outdoor Blanket, Gray/Red, 7&quot; x 5&quot;",This is perfect for outdoor use!  It's much better than hauling around a blanket.  It keeps wetness off of you while also being easy to clean up. I just wipe bottom with wipe to clean up.  It's material is better to sit on in hotter weather as it keeps you cooler than a fleece blanket would.  It's also so easy to fold up and go as well as carry around with the shoulder strap.  I use it outside in our yard all the time!,5,1
"Stroller Organizer PLUS Hooks for Strollers - Stroller Accessories Pack - Use as Car Organizer or Small Diaper Bag - Universal, Fits Most Handlebar of Pram/Baby Buggy Brands Like Britax, Maclaren, Bob, Chicco, etc. and Jogger, Umbrella, Double or Travel System - Two Insulated Cup Holders - Black Console with Roomy Storage - Must-Have for Every Parent - Satisfaction Guaranteed","This is a very well designed organizer bag for strollers missing or having limited parent trays. I have experience with the Jolly Jumper organizer bag and a few stroller's parent trays or lack there of (Uppababy Vista, First Years Ignite, Graco Click Connect). The Dot&Dot; stroller organizer bag has the best storage capacity and layout of all I've seen and used. I expect long use with the high quality material. The largest center compartment has a magnetic flap that allows quick access compared to open or zippered compartments from other organizers/trays. There are two parent facing pockets. One is a larger zippered pocket that can be used to store less used items and is slightly more secure since it takes more time to open. The second is a slim open style pocket for quickly stashing a cell phone or folded up map. There are deep insulated cup holders which function well and as expected. The attachment of the bag uses adjustable clips similar to what you find on backpacks. This is great for allowing quick detachment and slack for the bag to hang vertically, but the straps don't clamp down as tightly as velcro. The bag slides a bit on angled stroller bars (Uppababy Vista), so it should be attached to foam handles or more horizontal bars. Two hanging hooks are included, which is a nice touch for the premium cost. Overall, this is a great organizer bag that I highly recommend. Just double check where you intend to place it to ensure the attachment strap design works.Pros:+High quality material+Easy to use magnetic flap for center storage compartment. Must better than zippers+Plenty of storage+Insultated cup holders,+Accessory hooks included+Carrying strap (I like the idea, but don't know if I'll keep it in the bag for actual use...)Cons:-Attachment mechanism does not work well for angled stroller bars-(minor, not really product's fault) does not fold well with umbrella strollersDirect comparison:Uppababy Vista - Does not have any parent tray, so this is perfectFirst Years Ignite - Great tray for an umbrella stroller, but this is definitely betterGraco Click Connect - This almost appears to be modeled after the parent tray on this stroller, but with improvements! additional parent facing pockets.Jolly Jumper - Dot&Dot; is superior with exception of attachment design, but at a premium price.Jolly Jumper isn't insulated and has less storage. No hooks either.http://www.amazon.com/Jolly-Jumper-Stroller-Caddy-Handlebar/dp/B000JQ4B3C",4,1
